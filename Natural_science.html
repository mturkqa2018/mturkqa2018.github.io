<p>Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including Karl Popper</a>'s controversial falsifiability</a> criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. Validity</a>, accuracy</a>, and quality control</a>, such as peer review</a> and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

<p>This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component biophysics</a> up to complex ecologies</a>. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, classification</a> and behaviors</a> of organisms</a>, as well as how species</a> were formed and their interactions with each other and the environment</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The biological fields of botany</a>, zoology</a>, and medicine</a> date back to early periods of civilization, while microbiology</a> was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Some key developments in biology were the discovery of genetics</a>; evolution</a> through natural selection</a>; the germ theory of disease</a> and the application of the techniques of chemistry</a> and physics</a> at the level of the cell</a> or organic molecule</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. Molecular biology</a> is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while cellular biology</a> is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, anatomy</a> and physiology</a> looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while ecology</a> looks at how various organisms interrelate.

<p>Constituting the scientific study of matter at the atomic</a> and molecular</a> scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as gases</a>, molecules, crystals</a>, and metals</a>. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "the central science</a>" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of Alchemy</a>, a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of Robert Boyle</a>, the discoverer of gas, and Antoine Lavoisier</a>, who developed the theory of the Conservation of mass</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The discovery of the chemical elements</a> and atomic theory</a> began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of states of matter</a>, ions</a>, chemical bonds</a> and chemical reactions</a>. The success of this science led to a complementary chemical industry</a> that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

<p>Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the universe</a>, the forces</a> and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on mathematics</a> as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with philosophy</a> gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include Isaac Newton</a>'s theory of universal gravitation</a> and classical mechanics</a>, an understanding of electricity</a> and its relation to magnetism</a>, Einstein</a>'s theories of special</a> and general relativity</a>, the development of thermodynamics</a>, and the quantum mechanical</a> model of atomic and subatomic physics</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as quantum mechanics</a> and theoretical physics</a>, applied physics</a> and optics</a>. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like Isaac Newton</a>, Albert Einstein</a> and Lev Landau</a>, who worked in multiple areas.

<p>This discipline is the science of celestial objects</a> and phenomena</a> that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere</a>. It is concerned with the evolution, physics</a>, chemistry</a>, meteorology</a>, and motion</a> of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of stars</a>, planets</a>, comets</a>, galaxies</a> and the cosmos</a>. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the interstellar medium</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century.

<p>Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth</a>, including geology</a>, geophysics</a>, hydrology</a>, meteorology</a>, physical geography</a>, oceanography</a>, and soil science</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Although mining</a> and precious stones</a> have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of economic geology</a> and mineralogy</a> did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly palaeontology</a>, blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as geophysics</a>, in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics</a> in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to petroleum</a> and mineral resources</a>, climate</a> research and to environmental assessment</a> and remediation</a>.

<p>Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the atmospheric sciences</a> is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Oceanography">Oceanography</span></h4>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Oceanography</a></div>
<p>The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Interdisciplinary_studies">Interdisciplinary studies</span></h2>
<p>The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by astrophysics</a>, geophysics</a>, chemical physics</a> and biophysics</a>. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as biochemistry</a>, chemical biology</a>, geochemistry</a> and astrochemistry</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is environmental science</a>. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and biological components</a> of the environment</a>, with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on biodiversity</a> and sustainability</a>. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>A comparable discipline is oceanography</a>, as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as physical oceanography</a> and marine biology</a>. As the marine ecosystem</a> is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular species</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include nanoscience</a>, astrobiology</a>, and complex system</a> informatics</a>.

<p>Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of matter</a> and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of metallurgy</a>, the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of forensic engineering</a> (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and failure analysis</a>, the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their properties</a>. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics</a> and kinetics</a>, govern a material's microstructure</a>, and thus its properties.
