<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>In 1995, the 98th Flying Training Squadron was reactivated as a parachute training squadron at the United States Air Force Academy. With Air Staff approval to teach military parachuting, the parachute Branch under the Airmanship Division of the AFA was born in the Spring of 1966. In 1982, parachuting became a flight under the 94th ATS. In 1995, the Parachute Flight grew too large and was designated the 98th FTS.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>What started as a club training 25 students a year has grown into a premier character development program training 600 to 1,200 cadets annually and field nationally recognized competition and demonstration teams.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The basic AM-490 program, which was using round parachutes since its conception, evolved with the use of modern piggy back container systems and square parachutes for both the main and reserve. Each student is equipped with a radio so all landings can be assisted from the ground. The basic program trains 1,200 students per year with the majority of positions given to USAF Academy cadets. ROTC cadets are assigned positions on an availability and timing basis.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Training_Overview">Training Overview</span></h2>
<p>The <b>Wings of Blue</b> (sometimes known as <b>PTWOB</b>s, and stands for "Parachute Team – Wings of Blue"), is the parachuting unit at the United States Air Force Academy, near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The team operates as the 98th Flying Training Squadron, 306th Flying Training Group, Air Education and Training Command.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Over the last several decades, the Wings of Blue has been one of the outstanding parachute units in the United States. Since 1967, cadets have dominated national intercollegiate parachuting, winning 21 national championships.  They perform about 50 demonstrations each year, and have shown off their skills at the BCS National Championship, Orange Bowl, Copper Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and Pro Bowl and most Air Force Falcons football games. The team travels locally, nationally, and internationally to perform in air shows and competitions. Their stated mission is to: "Develop airmen through flight in its purest form—STAND IN THE DOOR!"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Training_history">Training history</span></h3>
<p>Parachuting at the U.S. Air Force Academy began in 1964 when a group of ambitious cadets took to the skies. The activity, at the time, was off-limits to cadets.  Knowing full well the consequences if caught participating, their involvements were nonetheless revealed through their own irrepressible success.  That spring, Cadet First Class (senior) Jay Kelley and Cadet Third Class (sophomore) Pete Johnston paired and won a novice team accuracy event—the Academy's first gold medal in collegiate competition.  Their achievements that day resulted in an invitational demonstration at the Pueblo Army Depot, after which the commander at Fort Carson sent a very nice letter to the Academy's superintendent, thanking him for allowing the fine young men of his skydiving team to participate".  After a thorough investigation, the Commandant of Cadets, Brigadier General Robert W. Strong Jr. "had a dilemma on his hands.  After all, balancing against the weight of these young men's sin was the positive publicity they had brought upon themselves and the Academy.  However illegal their activities, they were on to something good".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Each year since then, more than 800 cadets, officers, and enlisted members, from both U.S. and foreign services, complete five free fall jumps and earn their parachutist badge and rating.  The Air Force Academy offers the only jump program in the world authorized to allow students to perform unassisted free fall delays on their first jump without any prior jump experience. Although parachutist wings are awarded, they are non-operational in any Department of Defense unit; to be in an airborne operational unit or functioned job, personnel must complete the United States Army Airborne School in Ft. Benning, Georgia.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Training_programs">Training programs</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Airmanship_490">Airmanship 490</span></h4>
<p>Airmanship 490 (AM-490) is the basic free fall course instructed by members of the Wings of Blue. Students enrolled in the course undergo more than 30 hours of ground training prior to their first free fall jump. The rigorous ground training introduces and develops procedures and techniques for high altitude free fall, and for operating a steerable parachute system.  The course focuses on safety and emergency procedures to aid the students' ability to overcome their fears and perform under the extremely stressful and potentially life-threatening situations they may encounter.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Prior to each of the five jumps, students in the AM-490 class receive two gear inspections to ensure their parachutes are fitted and working properly.  These thorough inspections guarantee that the parachute's main and reserve canopy firing devices are on and accurately calibrated, and their gear is not defective.  Students also receive a comprehensive briefing from the jumpmaster before loading the aircraft.  Once airborne, the jumpmaster determines the exit/opening point, which varies with the day's wind patterns, student's receive their third and final gear inspection as the plane turns inbound for the jump run.  At 4,500 feet above ground level (AGL), winds rush into the fuselage as the jumpmaster opens the door then instructs the first jumper to: "STAND IN THE DOOR!"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h4><span id="Airmanship_491.2F492"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Airmanship_491/492">Airmanship 491/492</span></h4>
<p>Before the Fall semester begins, 25 cadets entering their sophomore year at the Academy are hand-selected from approximately 200 applicants for an upgrade program into the Wings of Blue, known informally as the "Wings of Green".  In their first semester in AM-491 they fine tune their free fall skills, completing the various stages of advanced military free fall. In the Spring semester the students enter AM-492, where they complete the rigorous training to become jumpmasters, and instruct an AM-490 class under the supervision of senior cadets on the Wings of Blue.  After a year of training the Wings of Green graduate onto the Wings of Blue and are recognized not only as AM-490 instructors, but qualified aircrew members for the 98th Flying Training Squadron operations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Airmanship_496">Airmanship 496</span></h4>
<p>Airmanship 496 (AM-496) is composed of the junior and senior Wings of Blue members. This group is divided into the junior competition/demonstration team, and the senior competition/demonstration team.  While cadets in AM-496 dedicate themselves to the demands of their individual teams, they remain united in their performance of duties within the squadron, team dynamics, and stay steadfast to their core mission as Airmanship 490 instructors and jumpmasters.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Both the Junior and Senior competition teams are composed of approximately ten members: two four-way teams, and one two-member team performing vertical relative work, also known as freefly.  All 20 members compete in canopy accuracy as well.  In the aerial events, teams are given 35 to 40 seconds to complete a preplanned formation maneuvers after exiting the plane.  Jumpers exit with a videographer who records the jump for judging.  The competition team represents the Wings of Blue at numerous competitions across the country, to include the National Skydiving Championships, National Collegiate Parachuting Championships, Black and Gold Competition (an all military competition), and numerous other free fall and accuracy meets throughout the year.  The comp team fares well in all these meets, winning medals at many of the meets they attend.  To date, the PTWOB competition team has been recognized as the leading collegiate team in the nation 29 of the last 39 years.
