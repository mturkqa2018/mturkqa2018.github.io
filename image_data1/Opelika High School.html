<p><b>Opelika High School</b> is located in Opelika, Lee County, Alabama. Opelika High School, of the Opelika City Schools, serves students in grades 9-12.  The principal is Farrell Seymore. The school's Assistant Principals are Amanda Inabinett, Russ Hardwick and Kendrick Myers.
</p><p>Opelika High School was originally built in 1972.  In August 2014, a $46 million renovation and construction project was completed.  The new building contains 87 new classrooms on two floors including seven computer labs.  Each classroom is outfitted with a Promethean interactive whiteboard, projector and ELMO document camera.  The business technology labs are outfitted with ClearTouch 70” interactive displays that are fully integrated with new educational software.  New classrooms include general classrooms for core classes, science labs, an ACCESS computer lab for distance learning and specialty classrooms for Consumer Science, Health Science, Driver's Education, Art, Special Education, Business Tech, Engineering, Publishing and Horticulture.  OHS also features a new cafeteria, kitchen and serving area.  Bulllog Stadium now has a turf field, new concession areas, new restrooms and ticket booths.  A 22,000 square foot indoor athletic facility including a turf practice field, Varsity locker room, coaches offices and meeting rooms was also built.  Renovations were also completed for the OHS baseball field, the Women's athletic facility, and the girls and boys PE areas.
</p><p>OHS offers classes designed for each student's learning level, from individual assistance to Advanced Placement.  Advanced Placement classes are offered in U.S.History, Biology, Chemistry, Government &amp; Economics, English Composition, English Literature, Art, Physics, Statistics and Calculus.  Dual enrollment is an option for students to earn both high school and college credits at Southern Union State Community College whose Opelika campus is located directly across the street from the high school.  Courses available for dual enrollment include Pre-Calculus, Calculus and US History 1.
</p><p>Career Technical classes prepare students for immediate transition following graduation into the workplace or articulated courses offered at Southern Union and other community colleges.  Programs include horticulture, business information technology, family and consumer science, engineering, and health science.  The annual horticulture department plant sale raises thousands of dollars for scholarships and program expenses.  A new Avatar Apps and Answers class is leading the way for innovative programs which will allow students to stay abreast of the ever-changing technological world.  Beginning January 2012 a new course, Direct Current, will be the first dual enrollment technical course.
</p><p>OHS also provides unique opportunities for students in courses such as desktop publishing, guitar, and foreign languages including Latin, Spanish and French.  Students enrolled in desktop publishing produce Perspectives, an award-winning literary magazine for which the art and graphics are provided by students enrolled in an advanced art class.  Other publications include The Mainstreet Gazette, a student newspaper, and ZigZag, the student yearbook.
</p><p>Athletics is another important component of the high school experience.  The athletics program is a competitive 6A program that offers many different opportunities.  Sports include football, baseball, track, cross country, soccer, wrestling, volleyball, golf, basketball, swimming, softball, tennis and competition cheerleading.  Students may also choose to participate in any of approximately 30 clubs ranging from Future Farmers of America to the National Honor Society.

From 1902 to 1911, Opelika offered classes through the 10th grade at the Opelika Public School, but was not able to afford a high school.  A 1907 law called for the formation of a "county high school" in each county run by the county board of education; when the state high school commission looked to establish such a high school in Lee County in 1911, only Opelika applied, and so the school was located there. This school's opening in the fall of 1911 marks the founding of Opelika High School. In 1914, Auburn High School successfully petitioned the state high school commission to take the county flagship status as the "Lee County High School" away from Opelika, starting the two schools long-standing rivalry, and the Opelika school became officially known as "Opelika High School" for the first time, operating as a town school.
</p><p>Opelika kept the old county high school building until 1917. On Saturday, January 20, 1917, Opelika High School burned to the ground. The two prior private schools in Opelika named "Opelika High School" also burned, in 1867 and in 1894.  For the next year, classes were held in the old Opelika Public School building, until a new structure could be built on the same grounds.  With the new building, Opelika High School was renamed in 1918 <b>Henry G. Clift High School</b>, after the then-mayor of Opelika. Opelika High School football started in 1922, with OHS falling to Alexander City (today Benjamin Russell) 71-0 in both schools' first ever game. It would be 1925 before Opelika High met Auburn High for the first time on the gridiron, a 21-6 loss; the Bulldogs and Tigers have met each year in football since 1933, with the OHS leading the overall series 42-38-3.
</p><p>In 1959, Opelika High moved into a new building on Denson Drive, and was subsequently renamed "Opelika High School" again. In 1972, OHS moved again, this time into the current facility on LaFayette Parkway.

<p>Opelika High School students produce a school newspaper called "The Bulldog". The Bulldog includes Editorial, Entertainment, News, Feature, Sports, and Club News sections. The staff sells ads to local businesses to fund the paper, which is printed by Media General.
</p><p>The high school's yearbook is titled "Zig-Zag."

<p>Students also prepare and distribute a literary-art magazine of student-submitted work called <i>Perspectives</i>. It is published once a year, and distributed during the spring semester.  Charles Hannah started the magazine in 1987 as an after-school activity. Since then, <i>Perspectives</i> has become a full class that meets first block every other day.

<p>The Opelika Band program is a source of pride for the Opelika City School System, its students, as well as parents and the entire community.  The band program begins in the 7th grade at Opelika Middle School and continues through the 12th grade at Opelika High School. The band maintains 20% of the student population, almost 350 students.
</p><p>Beginning in 7th grade, students at Opelika Middle School are encouraged to discover their musical talents in Beginning Band.  Students have the opportunity to “audition” the instruments and become acquainted with the basics of music notation as well as proper technique on the instrument.  
As students progress, they may be invited to become a member of the Concert Band.  This band consists of students who are progressing adequately, but may need further instruction before moving into the Symphonic Band.
</p><p>Students who progress to the 8th grade can become members of the Symphonic Band.  This group is composed of students who have achieved their musical goals in the 7th grade and intend on being a part of the band into high school.  This band has maintained a long history of success whether it is being recognized at Music Performance Assessment or competing in competitive festivals in Orlando, FL.
</p><p>Opelika Middle School Bands have also featured Jazz Bands and Percussion Ensembles as the schedule allows.  Typically, the instructors and students meet at 7am in order to rehearse and prepare for concerts and activities.
</p><p>The Opelika High School Band Program consists of several music ensembles: the marching band, Symphonic Band, Concert Band, and Jazz Band. There are also two new indoor visual ensembles, the Winter Guard and Indoor Percussion Ensemble and Concert Percussion Ensemble. Below is a brief description of each ensemble.
</p><p>The Opelika High School Marching Band, also known as “The Spirit of the South” meets and practices during the summer and through the fall semester. With rehearsals after school, this ensemble regularly practices and works towards achieving a high level of musicianship and marching technique. This group performs at every football game and competes at marching competitions throughout the year. The marching band averages 200 students per year and consists of the 9th-12th grade students who play wind or percussion instruments along with a visual ensemble made up of majorettes, color guard, and the “Showstoppers” kickline.  The “Spirit of the South” has traveled to many different destinations throughout the southeast and the nation. Some of the more recent trips and achievements have been multiple trips to Orlando, Philadelphia, and Chicago in 2011 to participate in the St. Patrick's Day Parade.  The “Spirit of the South” has twice performed in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, in 1989 and 1994.
</p><p>The band is under the direction of Mr. Neil Sasser. The assistant band director is Mike McGlynn. The OMS band director is under the direction of BreAnna North.
