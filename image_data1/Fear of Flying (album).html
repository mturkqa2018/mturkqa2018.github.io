<p><i><b>Fear of Flying</b></i> is the second studio album by American singer Mýa. It is the follow-up to her self titled debut <i>Mýa</i> (1998). It was released in the United States by University Music Entertainment and Interscope Records on April 25, 2000. Assembled by her label, recording sessions began as early as September 1999 and concluded in March 2000. For this album, Mýa made the conscious decision to get involved more creatively as well as collaborate with a wider range of producers and songwriters on the album. She consulted and collaborated with Rodney Jerkins, Swizz Beatz, Wyclef Jean, Knobody, Robin Thicke, Tricky Stewart, and Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis. Mýa described <i>Fear of Flying</i> as a metaphor for the ups and downs of life. A reoccurring theme throughout the album includes handling things like an adult and knowing you must have faith to make anything happen. She also felt that <i>Fear of Flying</i> was "a reflection of being in love for the very first time, experiencing success and the fears of fame."
</p><p>Upon its release, <i>Fear of Flying</i> received mixed reviews from music critics citing the album's "tepid material." Nevertheless, <i>Fear of Flying</i> debuted at number 15 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling 72,000 copies in its first week. Eventually <i>Fear of Flying</i> received several certifications such as a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold by both the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). The album's lead single, "The Best of Me" (featuring Jadakiss), peaked at number 50 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The second single, "Case of the Ex", reached number two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, while charting within the Top 20 in multiple countries. The album's third and final single, "Free", reached number 42 on <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and saw moderate success internationally, peaking within the Top 40 in a few countries. Nearly seven months after it was released, <i>Fear of Flying</i> was re-released with two new additional songs on November 7, 2000.

<p>In 1998, Mýa released her self-titled debut studio album. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, and peaked at number 29 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart and number 13 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, eventually being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), while selling over 1.4 million copies in the United States. A critical and commercial success, <i>Mýa</i> spawned three hit singles and earned several accolades, including a NAACP Image Award nomination and two Soul Train Music Award nominations. Following the commercial success of her debut, Mýa quickly re-entered the recording studio to begin work on her second album. During her two years away, she toured with several artists, and made her film debut in the thriller <i>In Too Deep</i> (1999). Additionally, she was selected by Bongo jeans as their spokesperson and had a Tommy Hilfiger lipstick shade named after her. During the development stages of the album Mýa consulted several different producers for her follow-up album, including She'kspere, Knobody, Tricky Stewart, and Robin Thicke as well as Wyclef and Swizz Beatz of Ruff Ryders. A number of guest vocalists also contributing to the project, including TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, Jordan Knight, and Beenie Man.
</p><p>Mýa, who did some writing on her debut album, was heavily involved in the production of <i>Fear of Flying</i>, commenting: "I wanted to get that hands-on experience. I was involved in every single process, from writing and recording to producing, mixing, and mastering." In response to the album's material, the singer commented that many of the album's songs are about female empowerment. "I'm learning that the decisions being made ultimately affect me, so I make most of them with the insight and help of other people", she explained. "I still have to focus on what feels good to me and what's going to work in the long run, instead of selling 20 million records or being controversial." The album's title, came from a song Mýa recorded by the same name — not from Erica Jong's 1973 novel of the same name. During an interview with <i>Billboard</i>, which discussed the name, Mýa noted that while she had not been aware of the book, she later "started reading it and noticed a lot of similarities: "<i>Fear of Flying</i> is a metaphor for the ups and downs of life. It's about handling things like an adult, knowing you must have faith to make anything happen." Interscope hired photographer and director David LaChapelle to shoot the images for the album's packaging. While she admired the work of Dave La Chapelle, Mýa revealed she cropped the original album's cover because it focused on her body, commenting, "I didn't like it. It wasn't capturing."

<p>Mýa considers her first album as an experiment and a learning ground. Prior to entering a recording studio, she had no vocal training and was doing improv-breathing the whole time on every song. With <i>Fear of Flying</i>, she acknowledged she learned things such as how she like to work and what works right for her in the studio. On <i>Fear of Flying</i>, she received vocal training and noted her vocals got along better with live performances. Speaking with <i>Time</i>, Mýa revealed with <i>Fear of Flying</i> she took more control over her sound and image. She commented that <i>Fear of Flying</i> was "an opportunity and a test."
For her second studio album, Mýa wrote a lot. Openly admitting, "Writing helps me sort through feelings that I'm trying to figure out." She noted her journal is filled with curse words and exclamation points, explaining, "It's either extreme highs or extreme lows." In an interview with <i>New York Daily News</i>, Mýa explained, her album is "about independence." She acknowledged with <i>Fear of Flying</i> she became "more confident", while commenting, "I'm a lot more straightforward. Things I didn't know how to say or when to say, I'm saying now." 
During the recording process, Mýa explained she clicked more with producers that like to start from scratch. Commenting, "It allowed me to be involved in the process. They were interested in what I had to say which made me feel good about myself." One particular producer Mýa gelled with was Wyclef Jean. Speaking on working him, she commented, "He was interested in what I had to say. My ideas - what I had to bring to the table. He wasn't afraid to go back into the studio and change things." Robin Thicke, a then new up and coming producer was another Mýa meshed well with. Of his contribution to <i>Fear of Flying</i> Mýa commented, "he is a true talent and I enjoyed working with him." While reviewing <i>Fear of Flying</i>, in an article, <i>Time</i> noted on her debut effort, Mýa was a "lovestruck teen" while on <i>Fear of Flying</i>, "she's a woman coming face to face with romantic entanglements." With 18 tracks featured on the album, <i>Time</i> applauded the album to manage that rare thing: to combine captivating beats with hummable melodies. Commenting on the finished product, <i>Time</i> wrote, "This is hip-hop soul with plenty of pop appeal."

<p>Musically, <i>Fear of Flying</i> has been described as a "smooth, catchy, personalized mixture of street-spice hip hop-soul." According to multiple critics, the album is more focused on themes than coherency of musical style. Sonically, the album's sound veers from quiet storm tracks to hard-edged Timbaland homages to cheerleader romps. The album's focal theme is "proper behavior on the dangerous grounds of courtship" and ranges from uptempo tracks to inspirational ballads. Several of the album's 18 tracks were co-written by Mýa, with <i>Vibe</i> magazine noting in an article that "Mýa tackles difficult melodic and rhythmic twists without ditching a nice conversational tone." <i>Fear of Flying</i> opens with "Case of the Ex", a song structured around producer Tricky Stewart's "driving, Beethoven-meets-Timbaland" chord changes, where Mýa expresses distrust in her lover. It is followed by the "dramatic" "Ride &amp; Shake", which was compared to the work of Whitney Houston. The dance-oriented "Pussycats" served as the album's fourth track and is a nursery rhyme-influenced song produced by Wyclef Jean and Jerry Duplessis.
</p><p>The album's "combative" sixth track, "The Best of Me", was produced by Swizz Beatz, and features Jadakiss. The TLC-sounding "How You Gonna Tell Me" has Mýa telling her girlfriend to spare her bad advice, while the "dance-floor-ready" "Takin' Me Over", produced by Robin Thicke featuring Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, begins with Mýa acting like the women she has expressed dislike for, while holed up in her bathroom with hair products. Track fourteen, "Can't Believe", is an emotional ballad.

<p>In support of the album, Interscope Records released three singles from <i>Fear of Flying</i>. Initially, before "The Best of Me" was chosen as the album's lead single, the song "Lie Detector" was considered as a potential contender. The instrumental for "The Best of Me" was originally expected to be used and recorded by rapper DMX in a Miami recording session with Swizz, however the instrumental of the song was left unused until the producer returned to New York City to start work on Mýa's album at The Hit Factory. Upon accidentally pushing a button in the studio, Mýa's management reportedly "jumped up and said 'That's it, that's it'" when they heard the songs instrumental. The record was among the last tracks that were recorded for the album. Jadakiss, a then member of the Ruff Ryders Entertainment's group The LOX, was chosen as the featured artist on the song as a result of label connections with Interscope Records. Released on March 6, 2000 to minor success in the U.S., "The Best of Me" peaked at number fifty on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and number fourteen on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, the single found modest chart success peaking at number twenty-six in Germany, while charting moderately in Netherlands and Switzerland. 
</p><p>The second single, "Case of the Ex" was released commercially on August 28, 2000. Originally a rap song, producer Tricky Stewart heavily rearranged the track to make it fit Harrison's persona. The song peaked at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and number ten on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Globally, "Case of the Ex" experienced similar success, peaking at number one in Australia for two weeks and earned a platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United Kingdom the song charted within the Top 10 and earned a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry. Elsewhere in Europe the song peaked within the Top 40 in The Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Scotland, France and Germany. 
</p><p>The third and final single released from the album "Free" originally appeared on the original soundtrack to the comedy film <i>Bait</i> (2000) starring Jamie Foxx. The track was written and produced by Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis. "Free" performed moderately well and peaked at number forty-two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and number fifty-two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

<p><i>People</i> named <i>Fear of Flying</i> their Album of the Week and called it an "unexpected treat," commenting though "Mýa offers no bold new sonic innovations. She does breathe life and sass into a genre too long held hostage by formula." In his review for AllMusic, Jon Azpiri wrote that "Mya's sophomore effort proves that she is a promising young talent, but still has yet to develop the chops necessary to rank among the best of R&amp;B divas." He felt that "without the energy of collaborators in the mix, many of her solo tracks wander into predictability. The album relies too heavily on tepid ballads such as the title track and 'Man of My Life'. Yet songs like 'Can't Believe', "For the First Time', and 'Lie Detector' show an emotional depth that lacked in her debut." Josh Tyrangiel of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> gave the album a C rating. He found that "Mýa can sing well enough; now she needs to find something to sing about." <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine writer Ernest Hardy gave the album 2 stars out of 5 and wrote: "The signature quiver in Mýa's voice does give her some sonic identity, but otherwise this could be the music of Destiny's Child, Aaliyah or any of the countless interchangeable hip-hop/R&amp;B divas."
</p><p><i>The Source</i> magazine gave the album a positive review, writing, "reaching out to hip-hop heads [...] Mýa proves she can hold her own in this competitive game of young female musicians. She's well on her way [to] the class of elite divas". <i>Uncut</i> called the album a "crafted, coffee-rich affair blending soul and swing [...] it's a grower which oozes class." While <i>Q</i> magazine rated the album 3 stars out of 5 and wrote: "Mýa demonstrates enough sass to suggest a sunny future." <i>Vibe</i> stated, that "the starlet has decided to show off her range [...] as if she and her top-notch producers attempted to wipe out the competition by transforming Mýa into each of her rivals in turn [...] a grand tour through the ever-changing moods of female adolescence".
