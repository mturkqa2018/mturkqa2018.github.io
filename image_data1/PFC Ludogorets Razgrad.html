<p><b>Professional Football Club Ludogorets 1945 Razgrad</b> (Bulgarian: <span lang="bg">ПФК Лудогорец Разград</span>), commonly known as <b>Ludogorets Razgrad</b> or simply <b>Ludogorets</b>, is a Bulgarian professional association football club in Razgrad, which currently competes in the First Professional Football League, the top-tier of the Bulgarian football league system.
</p><p>In their inaugural 2011–12 season in A Group after promotion, Ludogorets became the first Bulgarian team to win a treble by capturing the league championship, the Bulgarian Cup and the Bulgarian Supercup. Subsequently, the club made a significant international impact in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they reached the knockout phase of the tournament in their second only European run. Ludogorets are also the second Bulgarian team, after Levski Sofia, to enter the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, a feat which they achieved in the following 2014–15 season. During that same campaign, they became the first Bulgarian team to score points in the modern Champions League group stage following a 1–0 win over Basel in Sofia.
</p><p>Since their introduction to the Bulgarian top-flight, Ludogorets have established themselves as a dominant force in Bulgarian football, claiming every possible league title since then. They have also won the Bulgarian Cup twice and the Bulgarian Supercup on three occasions.
</p><p>The club's name stems from the Bulgarian name of the geographical region in which Razgrad is located – the Ludogorie region (meaning "region of wild forests") of northeastern Bulgaria. Ludogorets are nicknamed <i>The Eagles</i>, and in 2014, they were presented with a live eagle by UEFA Europa League opponents Lazio; the mascot was named Fortuna.
</p><p>Ludogorets' traditional home colours are green and white. The club's home ground is the Ludogorets Arena in Razgrad, a stadium with a capacity of 11,000 seats, which is currently being expanded to accommodate 12,500 spectators.

<p>The club was founded in 2001 as Ludogorie Football Club. Its name was adopted from the previous name of the debt-troubled sports club in the town at that time, Razgrad 2000. The latter eventually ceased existence in 2006 after its registered association announced bankruptcy during that same year.
</p><p>After playing for several years in the lower divisions of Bulgarian football, Ludogorets's successful campaign started in the 2009–10 season, when the team achieved promotion to the Bulgarian B Group. Shortly after, the club was acquired by Bulgarian entrepreneur Kiril Domuschiev. Ivaylo Petev, a former Litex Lovech midfielder, was also designated as head coach of the newly promoted second division outfit.

<p>In September 2010, the club was purchased by Bulgarian entrepreneur Kiril Domuschiev, with the clear intention to bring Ludogorets to the top division. The takeover was followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players. In May 2011, with Ivaylo Petev as head coach, the team completed this feat in Domuschiev's first season of ownership by winning promotion to A Group for the first time in club history.
</p><p>Prior to the start of 2011–12 season, Ludogorets completed the transfers of Emil Gargorov, Alexandre Barthe, Stanislav Genchev, Svetoslav Dyakov, Uroš Golubović, Ľubomír Guldan and Marcelinho. Ivan Stoyanov was also signed during the first month of the season. Ludogorets went unbeaten in the first nine matches of the season before losing 2–1 to Litex Lovech. In the last match before the winter break, Ludogorets drew 2–2 with CSKA Sofia, ending the autumn half of the season in first place. But, with three losses in a row in the middle of the spring half-season to Lokomotiv Plovdiv, Slavia Sofia and Cherno More Varna respectively, Ludogorets lost their lead in the standings to CSKA Sofia up until the end of the season. On the last day of the season, they won the match with CSKA Sofia 1–0, with a goal scored by former Levski striker Miroslav Ivanov. The match was effectively a head-to-head league title match since Ludogorets were two points behind the team from Sofia. The victory made them champions of Bulgaria in their first season in the top division, just one point ahead of CSKA.

<p>In May 2012, Ludogorets completed the domestic double when they won their first Bulgarian Cup title following a 2–1 victory against Lokomotiv Plovdiv at Lazur Stadium in Burgas, and in August 2012, they won the Bulgarian Supercup, defeating Lokomotiv 3–1, thus becoming the first team to win a treble in its first season in A Group and one of the few in the history of international football to do so.
</p><p>Ludogorets started the 2012–13 season with eight-straight wins and nine matches without a loss, and finished the half-season in first place, as in the previous season, with just one loss and seven goals conceded out of 15 matches. However, in the 2012–13 Bulgarian Cup, the club was eliminated in the round of 32 by CSKA Sofia 2–2 on aggregate, losing on away goals. In the spring half-season, Ludogorets occupied the first place with just three matches to play before the end of the season. Nevertheless, they were defeated 1–0 by Levski Sofia and Levski took the lead of A Group. On the final day of the season, Ludogorets had to beat the already relegated team of Montana and hope that Slavia Sofia would prevent Levski from winning their match. In the last minutes of the Levski–Slavia match, Levski conceived an own goal which subsequently led to a 1–1 draw, allowing Ludogorets to win their second championship title in dramatic fashion again. In the 2013 Supercup, they lost 5–3 on penalties to Beroe Stara Zagora after a 1–1 draw in regular time.
</p><p>In 2014, the team won their third consecutive championship title since promotion, two rounds before the end of the regular season. They finished nine points ahead of runners-up CSKA Sofia. The club also secured a second domestic double, defeating Botev Plovdiv 1–0 in the 2014 Bulgarian Cup Final. Ludogorets continued to dominate at domestic level in the following seasons, winning their fourth, fifth and sixth titles in 2015, 2016 and 2017 consecutively after finishing 8 points ahead of Beroe, 14 points ahead of Levski Sofia and 16 ahead of CSKA Sofia, respectively.

<p>As 2012–13 Bulgarian champions, Ludogorets played in the 2013–14 Champions League where they came through the qualifiers, eliminating subsequently Slovan Bratislava and Partizan en route. Ludogorets then lost to Basel in the play-offs, but earned the right to play in the UEFA Europa League.
</p><p>Ludogorets played in Group B of the 2013–14 Europa League. They were unbeaten in the group stage finishing first in the group with five wins in six games, including both home and away victories over the prominent PSV and Dinamo Zagreb. Their only dropped points were a 1–1 home draw with Chornomorets Odesa. In the knockout phase, Ludogorets beat the Italian cup holders Lazio 1–0 away and drew 3–3 at home for a 4–3 aggregate win, but then lost 0–3 at home and 0–4 on aggregate to Valencia in the round of 16.
</p><p>In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, Ludogorets again won both their qualifiers, against F91 Dudelange of Luxembourg and Partizan. In the play-off, they defeated Steaua București in dramatic fashion to reach the group stage for the first time. Goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was dismissed for a second yellow card in the last minute of extra time in the second leg, when Ludogorets had used all their substitutes. In the penalty shoot-out, centre-back Cosmin Moți, having converted the first penalty, went in goal and made two saves to put Ludogorets through 6–5 on penalties.
</p><p>Ludogorets made their debut in the 2014–15 Champions League group phase on 16 September 2014, grabbing a 1–1 equalizer away against Liverpool in the 90th minute scored by Dani Abalo, but in an eventual 1–2 loss, as the newly signed goalkeeper Milan Borjan gave away a penalty with a foul on Javier Manquillo, which Steven Gerrard converted to give Liverpool the victory. Ludogorets made their home debut in the 2014–15 Champions League group phase on 1 October 2014, scoring a stunning goal in the sixth minute through' attacking midfielder Marcelinho against Real Madrid, but in an eventual 1–2 loss. In this match, Cristiano Ronaldo took two penalties – the first was saved by goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov, while the second was scored for a 1–1 equalizer. On 22 October 2014, Yordan Minev scored his first goal for Ludogorets, scoring a crucial last-minute winning goal in a 1–0 home win over Basel in the group stage of the Champions League. On 26 November 2014, Dani Abalo scored in the third minute and Georgi Terziev scored his first goal in the 88th minute, grabbing a 2–2 equalizer against Liverpool, in an eventual 2–2 draw.
</p><p>Ludogorets won their 4th consecutive A Group title, but were left by several main squad players at the end of the season. Georgi Dermendziev was also replaced with Portuguese manager Bruno Ribeiro. The late changes saw Ludogorets being eliminated in the second qualifying round of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League by the underdog Moldovan champions Milsami Orhei.
</p><p>With Georgi Dermendzhiev returning at the helm of the squad, during the 2016–17 Champions League, Ludogorets won the qualifiers against Mladost Podgorica and Red Star Belgrade respectively, followed by a success in the play-off against Viktoria Plzeň. Eventually, they became the first Bulgarian team to qualify twice for the group stage of the tournament. In the group stage, Ludogorets achieved two draws against Basel and one against Paris Saint-Germain, which were enough to secure them the third place and a transfer to the knockout phase of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, another milestone never done before by a Bulgarian team. Ludogorets however shortly exited the competition after failing to overcome Copenhagen with an initial 1–2 home loss and a 0–0 away draw.
</p><p>Ludogorets failed to qualify for the groups of the next two editions of the Champion League, but however in both cases managed to enter the groups of Europe League. In the 2017–18 season they finished second in the group behind Braga, eliminating İstanbul Başakşehir and 1899 Hoffenheim, before losing in both matches to Milan in the round of 32.

Ludogorets's current crest is designed by the supporters and was chosen after a poll in the club's website. It was introduced to the public before the start of the 2016–17 First Professional League season.
</p><p>In June 2017, Ludogorets reached a sponsorship agreement with English sportswear manufacturer Umbro for the upcoming two seasons.

<li>Ludogorets is the second team in the world, together with Levadia Tallinn from Estonia, that after promoting from the second to the first level of the football league pyramid of its country, wins a treble, capturing all of the local trophies – the league, the national cup and the supercup.</li>
<li>Ludogorets is the first team in Bulgaria, that won <b>2</b> promotions in a row and then succeeded in achieving a treble.</li>
<li>Ludogorets became the first Bulgarian team to begin their group stage participation in European tournaments with <b>3</b> consecutive wins, when in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage they recorded consecutive wins against PSV (2–0), Dinamo Zagreb (3–0) and Chornomorets Odesa (1–0), without conceding a goal in any of the games.</li>
<li>After the end of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage, Ludogorets became the first Bulgarian team to record <b>9</b> wins in European competitions in a single season, as well as the first Bulgarian team to record <b>5</b> away wins in European competitions in a single season.</li>
<li>After the end of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage, Ludogorets became the first Bulgarian team to record points in that competition when they defeated Basel 1–0 at home. This was also the first home win for a Bulgarian team in the UEFA Champions League, and was followed by a 2–2 home draw with Liverpool.</li>
<li>Ludogorets became the first Bulgarian team to qualify twice for the Champions League group stage, achieving the feat during the 2016–17 season of the tournament. During that season, the team set a new record for most goals scored (6), and became the first Bulgarian team to avoid finishing last in their group.</li>
<li>As of the 2017–18 season, Ludogorets holds the record for most points scored in the group stage by a Bulgarian team with <b>4</b>, most goals scored with <b>6</b>, and fewest goals conceded with <b>14</b>.</li></ul>
