<p>Gessen was on the board of directors of the Moscow-based LGBT rights organization Triangle between 1993 and 1998.
</p><p>In an extensive October 2008 profile of Vladimir Putin for <i>Vanity Fair</i>, Gessen reported that the young Putin had been "an aspiring thug" and that "the backward evolution of Russia began" within days of his inauguration in 2000.
</p><p>She contributed several dozen commentaries on Russia to <i>The New York Times</i> blog "Latitude" between November 2011 and December 2013. Among her subjects were the banning of so-called "homosexual propaganda" and other related laws; the harassment and beating of journalists, and the depreciation in value of the ruble.
</p><p>In March 2013, politician Vitaly Milonov promoted the Russian law against foreign adoption of Russian children by saying: "The Americans want to adopt Russian children and bring them up in perverted families like Masha Gessen's."

<p>Gessen was dismissed from her position as the chief editor of Russia's oldest magazine, <i>Vokrug sveta</i>, a popular-science journal, in September 2012 after she refused to send a reporter to cover a Russian Geographical Society event about nature conservation featuring President Putin because she considered it political exploitation of environmental concerns. After she tweeted about her firing, Putin phoned her and claimed he was serious about his "nature conservation efforts." At his invitation, she met him and her former publisher at the Kremlin, and was offered her job back. She rejected the offer.

<p>In September 2012, Gessen was appointed as director of the Russian Service for Radio Liberty, a U.S. government-funded broadcaster based in Prague. Shortly after her appointment was announced and a few days after Gessen met with Putin, more than 40 members of Radio Liberty's staff were fired. The station also lost its Russian broadcasting licence several weeks after Gessen took over. The degree of Gessen's involvement in both of these events is unclear, but has caused controversy.

<p>In December 2013, she moved to New York because Russian authorities had begun to talk about taking children away from gay parents. In March, "the St Petersburg legislator [Milonov] who had become a spokesman for the law [against ‘homosexual propaganda' towards children] started mentioning me and my ‘perverted family’ in his interviews," and Gessen contacted an adoption lawyer asking "whether I had reason to worry that social services would go after my family and attempt to remove my oldest son, whom I adopted in 2000." The lawyer told Gessen "to instruct my son to run if he is approached by strangers and concluding: 'The answer to your question is at the airport.'" In June 2013, Gessen was beaten up outside of the Parliament; she said of the incident that "I realised that in all my interactions, including professional ones, I no longer felt I was perceived as a journalist first: I am now a person with a pink triangle." She stated that "a court would easily decide to annul Vova's adoption, and I wouldn't even know it." Given this potential threat to her family, Gessen "felt like no risk was small enough to be acceptable," she later told the CBC Radio. "So we just had to get out."
</p><p>In a January 2014 interview with ABC News, Gessen said that the Russian gay propaganda law had "led to a huge increase in antigay violence, including murders. It's led to attacks on gay and lesbian clubs and film festivals...and because these laws are passed supposedly to protect children, the people who are most targeted or have the most to fear are LGBT parents."
</p><p>She wrote in February 2014 that Citibank had closed her bank account because of concern about Russian money-laundering operations.
</p><p>As of 2017, Gessen serves as a visiting professor at Amherst College. She was named the John J. McCloy '16 Professor of American Institutions and International Diplomacy for the 2017–18 and 2018–19 academic years. In October 2017, she published her 10th book <i>The Future is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia</i>.

<p>Gessen married Svetlana Generalova, a Russian citizen who was also involved in the LGBT movement in Moscow, in 2004. The wedding took place in the U.S. By the time Gessen returned to the U.S. from Russia in December 2013, she was married to Darya Oreshkina.
</p><p>Gessen has three children—two sons and a daughter. Her eldest son, Vova, was born in 1997 in Russia and was adopted by Gessen from an orphanage in Kaliningrad for the children of HIV-positive women. Her daughter, Yolka, was born to Gessen in the U.S. in 2001. Her third child, a son, was born in February 2012.
</p><p>Gessen tested positive for the BRCA mutation that is correlated with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in 2005.

<p>In <i>The Man Without a Face</i>, Gessen offers an account of Putin's rise to power and summary of recent Russian politics. The book was published on 1 March 2012 and translated into 20 languages.
</p><p><i>The New York Review of Books</i> described the book as written in "beautifully clear and eloquent English," and stated that it was "at heart a description of th[e] secret police milieu" from which Putin originated and was "also very good at evoking…the culture and atmosphere within which [Putin] was raised, and the values he came to espouse." <i>The Guardian</i> called the book "luminous"; the <i>Telegraph</i> called it "courageous".

<p>A.D. Miller wrote in the <i>Telegraph</i> that "even readers who do not share Gessen's esteem for Pussy Riot as artists will be convinced of their courage." Miller described Gessen as "the right person to tell this story" and said her journalistic approach was "scrupulous and sensitive". <i>Booklist</i> described the book as "prickly, frank, precise, and sharply witty." <i>The New York Times</i> called it "urgent" and "damning." <i>The Washington Post</i> called the book an "excellent" portrait of Pussy Riot and said that "Gessen gives a particularly brilliant account of their trials". The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> said that Gessen was "Not just a keen observer of these events" but "also an impassioned partisan."
