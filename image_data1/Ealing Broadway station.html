<p>The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened its pioneering broad gauge tracks through Ealing Broadway between Paddington and Taplow on 6 April 1838, although Ealing Broadway station did not open until 1 December of that year. As the only station in the area when it opened, it was initially named 'Ealing', but was renamed Ealing Broadway in 1875.
</p><p>District Railway (DR, now the District Line) services commenced on 1 July 1879, when the DR opened a branch from Turnham Green on its Richmond line. The DR built its own three-platform station to the north of the GWR one, although, following the installation of a connection between the two railways to the east of the stations, DR trains also served the GWR station from 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885, on a short-lived service running to Windsor and Eton Central station, which was withdrawn as unremunerative. It was also intended to use the connection for a service to Uxbridge Vine Street station (via West Drayton), but this was never introduced.
</p><p>Following electrification of the main District line route through Ealing Common to South Harrow in 1903, the section to Ealing Broadway was electrified in 1905, and the first electric trains ran to Ealing Broadway on 1 July 1905. The original brick-built DR station was replaced with a stone-faced building in 1910.
</p><p>Prior to World War I, plans were made by the GWR to construct a new, mainly freight, line between Ealing and Shepherd's Bush, to connect west-to-south with the West London Railway. The Central London Railway (CLR, now the Central Line) would use the line by extending its tracks the short distance north from its terminus at Wood Lane (now closed), to meet the new GWR tracks. CLR services to two new platforms at Ealing Broadway, built between the GWR and DR stations, started on 3 August 1920, with, initially, just one intermediate stop at East Acton. The line also carried GWR steam freight trains until 1938, when the links at Ealing Broadway and west of North Acton were removed, and the line was fully transferred to London Underground.
</p><p>Originally separate companies, by 1920 the DR (by then known as the District Railway) and the CLR were both owned by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Despite this, the CLR services operated via the GWR station building, not the Underground one.
</p><p>The GWR-built station was demolished in 1961 and replaced by a low concrete structure containing shops and a ticket hall, opened in 1965, with a high-rise office building above. The new station building serves all the lines, and the separate District Line station ticket hall was closed, although the building remains, and the original station facade is now the entrance for multiple shops.
</p><p>On Platform 9 (District line) there are some roundels of a style dating from <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 1908</span>, three of which are replicas made in 1992.

<ul><li>four National Rail (platforms 1 to 4). Trains do not stop at platforms 1 and 2, except during engineering works or other disruption. Platforms 1 and 3 are on lines leaving London, while 2 and 4 are on lines into London. Most of the National Rail platforms are open to the elements, although there are some waiting rooms on each platform.</li>
<li>two Central line (5 and 6), which have a shared awning canopy.</li>

<p>Crossrail will call at Ealing Broadway. Through services across London are expected to commence in autumn 2019. To accommodate Crossrail services, various alterations will be made by Network Rail:
</p>
<ul><li>Platforms 1–3 extended</li>
<li>Step-free access</li>
<li>Enlarged booking hall with more ticket gatelines</li>
<li>New footbridge to the east end of the station linking platforms 1–4</li>
<li>Construction of a new canopy on platform 4.</li>
<li>Enlarged and remodelled pedestrian forecourt</li></ul>

<p>The West London Business group backs a Surbiton-to-Brent Cross light metro tube line, called the West London Orbital underground railway, based on Copenhagen Metro technology, which would include a station underground at Ealing Broadway. The London Borough of Ealing does not support the proposal, saying "no consensus to progress this project [due] to extremely high costs".
</p><p>The London Group of the Campaign for Better Transport published a plan in 2008 for an off-road orbital North and West London Light railway (NWLLR), sharing the Dudding Hill Line freight corridor, and using the middle two of the six track beds at North Acton. In April 2009 Ealing Council voted to call on Transport for London to look into the proposal.
