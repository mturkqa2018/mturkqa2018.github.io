<p>The commune is located on the eastern boundary of the <i>Baronnies Orientales</i> on ProvenÃ§al limestone formations of the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods (sedimentary rocks from a former Alpine Ocean) between three main geological formations of the Alps:
</p>
<ul><li>the <b>Digne Nappe</b> at the level of the Valavoire lobe: there is a thrust sheet or Nappe - i.e. a slab about 5000 m thick which was moved to the south-west during the Oligocene and at the end of the formation of the Alps. The lobes (or scales) correspond to the exposed edges to the west of the Nappe;</li>
<li>the <b>Durance fault</b> to the south-west in the valley;</li>
<li>the <b>Plateau of Valensole</b> to the south-east: a molassic basin of the Miocene and Pliocene periods composed of detritic sedimentary rocks (deposited from the erosion of the mountains which appeared in the Oligocene).</li></ul>

<p>The village is located at an altitude of 1,137 metres above sea level in the <i>Massif des Monges</i>. The altitude varies from 881 metres (in the downstream gorges of the <i>Vanson</i> and the narrow valley in the west of the commune) to 2,114 metres at the top of <i>Coste Belle</i> along the Conaples ridge in the east. Mount Jouere is located in the north with the ridge of <i>Clot des Martres</i> being the northern boundary of the commune. The Planchettes ravine lies between this mountain and the Lieuron - the mountain overlooking the village.
</p><p>In the south, the <i>Col de Font-Belle</i>, towards Le Castellard-Melan, lies between the Melan mountain and the escarpment of GÃ©ruen. Beyond this to the east are the <i>Ravine des Barres</i> and then the <i>Col Saint-Antoine</i>.

<p>None of the 200 communes of the department is in a no seismic risk zone. The canton of Sisteron to which Authon belongs is zone 1b (low risk) according to the deterministic classification of 1991 based on the historical seismicity, and zone 4 (medium risk) according to the probabilistic classification EC8 in 2011. Authon also faces three other natural hazards:
</p>
<ul><li>forest fire,</li>
<li>flood (the Vanson and tributaries)</li>
<li>landslide: the town has an average to high hazard on some slopes.</li></ul>
<p>Authon is not exposed to any risk of technological origin identified by the prefecture.
</p><p>There is no risk prevention plan for foreseeable natural risks (PPR) nor is one planned for the commune and there is no DICRIM.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Toponymy">Toponymy</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The area appears for the first time in texts of 1237 (<i>de Autono</i>). According to Charles Rostaing the name designates a height (from the Latin <i>altus</i> meaning "high" and the Gallic <i>dunam</i>). BÃ©nÃ©dicte FÃ©niÃ© has a slightly different explanation using as a base <i>*Al-t-</i> and he also saw an oronym in Authon. According to Ernest NÃ¨gre the name came from the Germanic proper name <i>Alto</i>.
</p><p>The name <i>BrianÃ§on</i> is reported in 1190 and <i>Feissal</i> is reported in 1113.
</p><p>The name <i>Saint-Michel</i>, near BrianÃ§on, is perhaps the name of the community church.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>At Feissal there was a priory of the Abbey of Saint Victor, Marseille which was first mentioned in 1113.
</p><p>The churches and communities of Authon and BrianÃ§on depended on the Order of the Temple in the 13th century who also received the related income. After the dissolution of the Order they moved to dependence on the <i>Commandery of Claret</i> of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Among the fiefs covering these communities there was also Dromon. <i>Rigaut de Montomat</i> seized the castle on 4 November 1392 and established a substantial toll for passage to Maupas. He also ransomed the surroundings until the Viguerie of Sisteron raised an army equipped with artillery and put siege to the castle. In February Rigaut de Montomat abandoned the castle for 800 florins and a promise to set fire to it, a promise he kept. The BrianÃ§on community, which consisted of 42 fires in 1315, was depopulated by the crises of the 14th century (the Black Death and the Hundred Years War) and was annexed by Authon in the 15th century. At the end of the Middle Ages a Fair was held in Authon as it was located on one of the routes between the Sisteron bridge on the Durance and the BlÃ©one valley.
</p><p>In the 12th century there was a lawsuit opposing the hospitallier commander of the village over an honorable ceremony (it brought honour to the peasants who were invited): the villagers brought wood at Christmas and the commander shared the family nectar (a superior quality drink), fine pastries, and grapes with their leaders. He wanted to move the ceremony to a variable date and replace the nectar with good wine.
</p><p>At the beginning of the French Revolution the news of the storming of the Bastille was welcomed but caused collective fear of an aristocratic reaction. Locally the Great Fear came from Tallard and was part of the flow of "Macon Fear", reaching the area of La Motte on the evening of 31 July 1789. The consuls of the village community were warned that a troop of 5-6,000 brigands were moving towards Haute-Provence after having looted the DauphinÃ©. The communities of La Motte, Clamensane, Saint-Geniez, Authon, Curbans, Bayons, and Claret together constituted a group of 700 armed men. They put the Marquis d'Hugues de Beaujeu at its head who decided to meet the danger by monitoring the ferries on the Durance.
</p><p>On 2 August the panic settled and the news which was originally rumours were clarified. An important change took place however: the communities were armed and organized to defend themselves and their neighbours. A sense of solidarity was born within the communities and between neighbouring communities and the consuls decided to maintain the National Guard. As soon as the fear subsided, however, the authorities recommended disarming the workers and the landless peasants and to keep only property owners in the National Guard.
</p><p>Between 1820 and 1874, four mills were built "suddenly" at Authon (flour, nut oil) in a rivalry with Saint-Geniez. They went bankrupt. Each 29 June until 1843, then on Trinity Sunday, there has been a pilgrimage of the faithful of the commune of Baume from Saint Vincent church to the Melan mountain (in MÃ©lan commune). As with many communes in the department, Authon and Feissal endowed a school well before the Jules Ferry laws: in 1863 a school providing a primary education to boys already operated in both villages. No instruction was given to girls: the Falloux Act (1851), which required the opening of a girls' school in communes with more than 800 inhabitants, and the first Duruy law (1867), which lowered the threshold to 500 inhabitants, did not concern Authon or Feissal. It was only with the Ferry laws that the girls in the two communes were educated.
</p><p>The town suffered a major rural exodus. Authon lost population in 1793, earlier than elsewhere in the department (where the rural exodus began in the 1850s).
</p><p>Some men called to the front to die during the First World War. The commune of Feissal (97 inhabitants in 1765) merged with Authon in 1936.
</p><p>During World War II the department was occupied by Italy from 1942-1943 and then by Nazi Germany until August 1944. At that time the nearby town of Sisteron was bombed by the allies during the landings in Provence. Liberation came quickly after the landings and the commune became part of the liberated zone on 20 August.
</p><p>Unlike the departmental trend, population loss continued long after the war until 1982 when the town, had only 21 inhabitants. Population growth began at the end of the 20th century. Population reduced by 90% since 1793 with a population of only 40 in the 2000s.

<p>The mayoral election was an innovation of the French Revolution in 1789. From 1790 to 1795 mayors were elected by suffrage for 2 years. From 1795 to 1800 there was no mayor and the commune simply designated a municipal agent who was delegated to the <i>Municipality of the Canton</i>.
</p><p>In 1799-1800, the Consulate returned to the election of mayors who were now appointed by the central government. This system was maintained by the following schemes except during the Second Republic (1848-1851). After keeping the authoritarian system the Third Republic liberalized the system by the law of 5 April 1884 Administration of Communes: the council, elected by universal suffrage, elects the mayor from among its members.

<p>After the crises of the 14th and 15th centuries and a long period of growth until the beginning of the 19th century, there was a period of "slack" where the population remained stable at a high level. This period lasted from 1806 to 1846. The rural exodus then caused long term population loss. In 1901 the town recorded the loss of more than half its population since 1800. The outwards movement of population continued until 1980. Since then the population has doubled to over 40 people, 10% of its historical peak.
</p><p>Authon has an area of 4,016 hectares and a population of 45 and is ranked in the following table:

<p>At the end of 2010 the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, fisheries) had 15 businesses under the INSEE definition and 10 according to the Agreste Department of Agriculture survey. This represents a doubling in the 2000s. The farms are sheep and polyculture farms. The utilized agricultural area (UAA) has almost doubled in ten years from 572 to 1,056 hectares with almost all of the area being devoted to livestock.
</p><p>Authon is included in the boundaries of an Appellation d'origine contrÃ´lÃ©e (AOC) Designation for Lavender oil (<i>Huile essentielle de lavande de Haute-Provence</i>) and nine Geographically Protected Indications (IGP):.

<p>Lavender has been harvested for centuries in the wild until cropping was organized in the 16th century along with the distillation of its flowers. Its golden age was at the beginning of the 20th century although it was during the 1920s that there was a real fever for planting. After the crisis of 1929 and the Second World War the market saw renewed demand from 1955 only to go into crisis five years later. Mechanization of harvesting, better organization of the market, and obtaining an AOC for "Lavender essential oil from Haute-Provence" in 1981 should have boosted production. Production fell however from approximately 200 tonnes in the early 1980s to 25 tonnes in 1990 then finally increased to 80 tons in 2003.

<p><i>Sisteron lamb</i> is a lamb raised by its mother in the Alps or DrÃ´me of Provence for a minimum 60 days with an age between 70 and 150 days and weighing 13 to 19 kg. It comes from traditional farms with Merino, Mourerous, or Prealpes du Sud mothers who breastfeed for at least two months on a pastoral area with less than 10 sheep per hectare and with a minimum of 10 hectares in area. Lambs who meet these criteria are can be sold under the control of the INAO with the red <i>Sisteron lamb</i> label granted by a governmental decree dated 3 January 2005.
</p><p>These quality requirements put an end to the practice of flocks being reared in the same conditions but from other regions. Each year nearly 400,000 animals used to pass through the slaughterhouses of Sisteron enjoying a certain laxity sought to usurp their provenance.

<p>Apples from Alpes de Haute-Durance received a Protected Geographical Indication which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 17 April 2010.
</p><p>The IGP covers the apple varieties <i>Golden Delicious</i> and <i>Gala</i> from six cantons in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and thirteen cantons in Hautes-Alpes located between 450 metres and 900 metres above sea level. The quality of these apples is linked to their soil and, in particular, the climate of Haute-Durance with over 300 days of sunshine per year. The prevailing cold nights during the maturation of apples prevents the degradation of acids while a strong diurnal temperature range allows them to yellow and even become pink.
