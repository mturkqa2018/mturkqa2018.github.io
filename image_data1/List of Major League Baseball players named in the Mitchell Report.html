<p>The <b>List of Major League Baseball players named in the Mitchell Report</b> includes active and former Major League players as well as free agents. The Mitchell Report is the result of former US Senator George J. Mitchell's (D–ME) 20-month investigation into performance-enhancing drug use in Major League Baseball (MLB). It was released December 13, 2007.
</p><p>The following is a list of the Major League Baseball players named in the Mitchell Report. Inclusion on the list does not necessarily mean the player was involved in illegal activity. In some instances, insufficient evidence was provided to draw a conclusion, and some players were mentioned in other contexts.
</p><p>The Mitchell Report also stated that interviews were requested of five MLB players who had spoken out publicly on the steroid issue. Of these players, only one, Frank Thomas, was willing to be interviewed. The Mitchell Report  stated that there was no evidence that any of these five had used performance-enhancing drugs. Curt Schilling, one of the four players who declined to interview with Mitchell, explained that he denied Mitchell's request because he "would have nothing to offer" Mitchell's investigation "other than personal opinion and hypotheticals."
</p><p>Jason Giambi was required to interview with Mitchell and his investigators by Commissioner Bud Selig under threat of discipline.  This stemmed from Giambi's ongoing involvement with the BALCO investigation and statements he had given to the media.
