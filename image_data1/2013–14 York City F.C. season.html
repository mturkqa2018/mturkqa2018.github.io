<p>The 2013–14 season was the 92nd season of competitive association football and 77th season in the Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their 17th-place finish in 2012–13 meant it was their second consecutive season in League Two. The season ran from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014.
</p><p>Nigel Worthington, starting his first full season as York manager, made eight permanent summer signings. By the turn of the year York were only above the relegation zone on goal difference, before a 17-match unbeaten run saw the team finish in seventh-place in the 24-team 2013–14 League Two. This meant York qualified for the play-offs, and they were eliminated in the semi-final by Fleetwood Town. York were knocked out of the 2013–14 FA Cup, League Cup and Football League Trophy in their opening round matches.
</p><p>35 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were 12 different goalscorers. Defender Ben Davies missed only five of the 52 competitive matches played over the season. Wes Fletcher finished as leading scorer with 13 goals, of which 10 came in league competition and three came in the FA Cup. The winner of the Clubman of the Year award, voted for by the club's supporters, was Lanre Oyebanjo.

<p>York achieved their first home win in five matches after beating Exeter 2–1, with first half goals scored by McCombe and Coulson. Hayhurst's loan was extended to the end of the season, having impressed in his six appearances for the club. Coulson scored again with the only goal, a 41st-minute header, in York's 1–0 away win over AFC Wimbledon. Bowman scored the only goal with a 32nd-minute penalty as York won 1–0 away against Mansfield, in which Fletcher missed the opportunity to extend the lead when his stoppage time penalty was saved by Alan Marriott. York moved one place outside the play-offs with a 2–0 home win over Wycombe, courtesy of a second Bowman penalty in as many matches and a Carson goal from the edge of the penalty area. Coulson scored York's only goal in a 1–0 away win over struggling Portsmouth with a low volley in the fifth minute; this result meant York moved into the play-offs in seventh-place with eight fixtures remaining.
</p><p>Striker Calvin Andrew, who had been released by Mansfield in January 2014, was signed on a contract for the remainder of the season. He made his debut as a substitute in York's 1–0 home win over bottom of the table Torquay, in which Hayhurst scored the only goal in the 11th minute with an 18-yard shot that deflected off Aaron Downes. Middlesbrough winger Brobbel rejoined on loan until the end of the season, following an injury to Carson. York's run of successive wins ended on six matches after a 0–0 home draw with Burton, and this result saw York drop out of the play-offs in eighth-place. With the team recording six wins and one draw in March 2014, including six clean sheets, Worthington was named League Two Manager of the Month.

<p>Pope made a number of saves as York held league leaders Rochdale to a 0–0 away draw, with a point being enough to lift the team back into seventh-place. York were prevented from equalling a club record of eight consecutive clean sheets when Accrington scored a stoppage time equaliser in a 1–1 home draw, in which York had taken earlier taken the lead with a Coulson penalty. A 1–0 win away win over Oxford, which was decided by a second half Coulson penalty, resulted in York moving one place above their opponents and back into seventh-place. York consolidated their place in a play-off position after beating Bury 1–0 at home with a fifth-minute goal scored by Lowe from a Hayhurst corner. The result meant York opened up a five-point lead over eighth-placed Oxford with two fixtures remaining. A place in the League Two play-offs was secured following a 1–0 win over Newport at home, in which Coulson scored the only goal in the 77th minute with a 25-yard free kick. Pope earned a nomination for League Two Player of the Month for April 2014, having conceded only one goal in five matches in that period.

<p>The league season concluded with an away match against divisional runners-up Scunthorpe; having gone two goals down York fought back to draw 2–2 with goals scored by Brobbel and Andrew. This result meant York finished the season in seventh-place in League Two, and would thus play fourth-placed Fleetwood in the play-off semi-final on the back of a 17-match unbeaten run. York lost 1–0 to Fleetwood in the first leg at home; the goal came from former York player Matty Blair in the 50th minute, who scored from close range after Antoni Sarcevic's shot was blocked on the line. A 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood in the second leg meant York were eliminated 1–0 on aggregate, ending the prospect of a second promotion in three seasons. At an awards night held at York Racecourse, Oyebanjo was voted Clubman of the Year for 2013–14.
