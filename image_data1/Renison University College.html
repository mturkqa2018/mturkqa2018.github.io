<p><b>Renison University College</b> is an affiliated university college of the University of Waterloo and located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Renison's campus is situated on the western border of Waterloo's main campus. The university college offers academic programs that count as credit toward a University of Waterloo degree. Most academic courses are offered within Waterloo's Faculty of Arts, focusing on social sciences, language and culture.
</p><p>Renison focuses its academic work in three primary areas: Social Engagement and Innovation; Global Engagement through Languages and Cultures; and Community Engagement through the offering of non-degree program and praxis-based learning related to various degrees. Renison's social engagement and Innovation focus is developed in the work of the department of Social Development Studies and Renison's School of Social Work. The focus on global engagements finds expression in a variety of forms, most notably through the work of the department of Culture and Language Studies and the Studies in Islam program unit. Its focus on Community Engagement is gathered in the Centre for Community and Professional Education.
</p><p>Renison University College maintains a residence that houses up to 220 University of Waterloo students. Residents may be in any field of undergraduate study at the University of Waterloo and are not mandated to take courses at Renison.  The university college residence maintains one of the lowest don to student ratios of all the on-campus residences.
</p><p>The institution was established on January 14, 1959  as Renison College, under the authority of the Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Huron. In 2010, it officially became Renison University College as a reflection of Renison's academic focus.  It was founded by members of the local Anglican community in Waterloo, Ontario and Kitchener, Ontario and continues to be affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada.

<p>Renison was incorporated on January 14, 1959 by provincial Letters Patent and under the authority of the Synod of the Diocese of Huron, due to the efforts of the Kitchener and Waterloo Anglican communities.  The efforts of Renison Founder The Ven. Harvey Southcott, who was rector of Church of the Holy Saviour at the time, were particularly influential as he had the original vision for an Anglican college in Waterloo. Renison continues to enjoy support from the Anglican community and, in particular, from within the Diocese.
</p><p>Originally a two-storey, seven-room house at 193 Albert Street in Waterloo that opened its doors in 1959, Renison College featured a small chapel, chaplain's office, a small library, a study and meeting space for students, and three bedrooms that accommodated seven male students. The College offered courses in Religious Knowledge, Geography and Philosophy.
</p><p>On July 1, 1960, Renison struck an affiliation agreement with the University of Waterloo for the right to offer programs in Arts and the Social Sciences for credit towards a Bachelor of Arts degree from Waterloo. The University transferred five acres of land on the west side of its campus to Renison in 1961, and Renison purchased an additional acre.

<p>Originally incorporated in 1959 as Renison College, it was felt that the addition of the word ‘university’ would strengthen Renison's reputation and identity with international partners. During her tenure as Principal, Dr. Gail Cuthbert Brandt had explored the option of gaining an individual charter for Renison.  However, it wasn't until Dr. John Crossley's tenure in the mid-2000s that the process began to move forward.  In 2010, following years of negotiations, supplementary Letters Patent were issued by the Government of Ontario, making the official name of the college 'Renison University College' and reflecting Renison's academic focus.

<p>Renison University College was named after a contemporary Canadian church leader, The Most Reverend Robert John Renison. Archbishop Renison served in the Anglican Church of Canada with great distinction for nearly six decades, a significant amount of that time being spent in Northern Ontario. Before his death in 1957, he became Metropolitan of Ontario and Archbishop of Moosonee. Archbishop Renison's widow, Elisabeth, presented the College with his portrait and a painting of his personal coat of arms. The family agreed to let the new institution use his heraldic emblem and accompanying motto, Sed Coelum Solum (one sky over all), until the college was granted its own unique coat of arms in 1978.

<p>Renison is situated on 6 acres of land in Waterloo, Ontario and is directly adjacent to the University of Waterloo campus. Most buildings on the University of Waterloo campus are a five-minute walk from Renison. Renison's campus is bordered by the University of Waterloo, St. Jerome's University and St. Paul's University College. One numbered road intersects Renison's campus: Westmount Road North.

<p>In 1962, Renison completed its first building on the current campus, the Founders Building, which provided offices, classrooms, and two residence wings to house 40 men and 40 women. The cornerstone of this first building on Renison's campus was laid by Elizabeth Renison and LCol. The Hon. J. Keiller MacKay, 19th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.
</p><p>Thanks to Renison and the other affiliated colleges, 1962 was the first time Waterloo students could live on campus as the first Waterloo residence would not be opened until 1965.
</p><p>In 1964, Renison expanded with the construction of the Luxton Building, with classrooms, faculty offices, and a residence for 98 men, allowing the Founders Building to be used as the women's residence.  This building was named for The Rt. Rev. George N. Luxton, Bishop of Huron and Renison's first Chancellor and, later, first Visitor.  The Luxton Building would also come to include a favourite place for student relaxation at Renison, the Moose Room.
</p><p>Then, in 1992, the College expanded further with the addition of the Chapel of St. Bede, the Great Hall cafeteria, two additional residence floors, and an enlarged library.  This would be followed in 2005 with the addition of the Academic Centre.  This building included six large classrooms, office space to accommodate Renison's growing faculty and staff, the Keiko and Charles Belair Centre for East Asian Studies, a substantially larger library with meeting rooms and the Ministry Centre.
</p><p>2013 saw the completion of the East Side Extension, which is home to new classroom space, student lounges, and Renison's School of Social Work.  Ontario's 28th Lieutenant Governor, The Hon. David C. Onley, was in attendance at the grand opening to declare the building officially open.
</p><p>Renison completed its newest building in 2015 and was opened by His Excellency The Right Hon. David Johnston, Governor General of Canada and former president of the University of Waterloo. This building is home to Renison's English Language Institute and English Language Studies. With 17 new classrooms, the complex also features student lounges, meeting rooms, a glass atrium capable of hosting small events, and office space for staff and faculty members.

<p>Renison houses the Lusi Wong Library, whose collection focuses on the subjects taught at Renison. Renison students have access to over 7 million items within the library's resources through the Tri-University Group of Libraries (TUG) system. TUG is part of a partnership involving the libraries of the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Guelph. Students have access to library resources totaling 7.5 million items through the automated library system. Renison students are able to borrow books and other resources from any of the three libraries and have them delivered to the Lusi Wong Library for pick-up. Likewise, any books borrowed from these three universities’ libraries can be returned at Renison. Study rooms are available for students to book for group work or small meetings. In a poll conducted by the University of Waterloo's student newspaper, The Imprint, Renison's Lusi Wong Library was voted the best place to study on campus.

<dt>Symbolism</dt>
<dd>Bishop Renison’s arms were incorporated into Renison University College’s unique shield to create what is known as a differenced arms.  Granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland in 1978, the College added to the design with a green border placed around the perimeter of the archbishop’s shield.  On this green border are three gold maple leaves and three gold buckles.  The buckles were borrowed from the arms of The Ven. Archie Skirving, Chair of the Board of Governors at the time of the grant.<br/> <br/>The crest of the College’s arms was granted in 1984 by the Lord Lyon King of Arms.  Like Archbishop Renison's crest, the College's crest is also a red moose with gold antlers.  The moose head faces forward and features a white ‘passion cross’ on the neck of the moose.  This cross was borrowed from the arms of Ian Campbell, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Renison at the time of the grant.<br/><br/>The supporters of the College's arms were granted in 2014 by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The red lion on the right is taken from the arms of the University of Waterloo, and thus symbolizes Renison's affiliation with the university. The red lion is also found in the arms of Bishop D. Ralph Spence, Chancellor of the College at the time of the grant. The beaver is taken from the arms of the Anglican Diocese of Huron, the Bishop of which is the Visitor to the College. The wagon wheel is taken from the arms of the Church of the Holy Saviour, Waterloo, the founding parish of the College. <br/>The grassy green mount represents Renison's verdant campus. The trilliums recall the college's location in Ontario and the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, because they are the provincial flower and are found in the Region's arms. The maple keys symbolize the ten founders of the College and their vision that those being educated will grow and develop for the benefit of their communities.<br/> <br/> The badge of the College features the College crest – a red moose with gold antlers and a white cross on its neck – on a gold Maltese cross.  This was granted in 1990 by the Canadian Heraldic Authority and painted by Renison alumnus and Honorary Senior Fellow, The Rev. Canon David Bowyer.</dd>

<p>Renison's convocation regalia, a mace and two staves, were gifts to the College by The Rt. Rev. D. Ralph Spence and Mrs. Carol Spence on the occasion of Bishop Spence's Installation as Renison's eighth chancellor.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mace">Mace</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Maces have been used to symbolize authority and order since early medieval times. Parliaments, universities and civic governments use a mace to remind all that their right to govern and teach comes from the Crown; in Renison's case, the Crown in Right of Ontario.
</p><p>Renison's mace is made of local wood from the Waterloo area and fashioned by local artisans. It follows the shape of most maces with a crown, a bowl, and a wooden shaft. The Mace is to be carried by an honoured member of the College in front of the Chancellor at Convocations and special ceremonies.
</p><p>The crown is carved with maple leaves and trilliums, reflecting the institution of the Crown in Canada and Ontario. The bowl has three coats of arms; Renison University College, University of Waterloo, and the personal arms of The Rt. Rev. Spence. Carved moose heads, derived from the crest of the coat of arms, support the bowl.
</p><p>Down the shaft of the mace is the small coat of arms belonging to The Rev. Canon David Bowyer, Honorary Senior Fellow of Renison and painter of the arms located on the mace.
