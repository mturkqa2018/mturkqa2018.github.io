<p>The <b>Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award</b> is an annual award honoring the achievements of a female individual from the world of disabled sports. Established with the aid of disability advocate and former United States Paralympic soccer player Eli Wolff, the accolade's trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, is presented to the disabled sportswoman adjudged to be the best at the annual ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was first bestowed as part of the ESPY Awards in 2005 after the non-gender specific Best Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award was presented the previous three years (all won by sportsmen). Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months.
</p><p>The inaugural winner of the Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award at the 2005 ceremony was American swimmer Erin Popovich, who is affected by achondroplasia.  She won seven gold medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. She is one of three people to have won the Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award more than once, winning again at the 2009 awards. Fellow swimmer Jessica Long has the most victories of any other sportswoman, collecting the award three times at the 2007, 2012 and 2013 awards with one further nomination at the 2009 ceremony, while cross-country skier Oksana Masters has been nominated the most times (four) without winning. Swimmers have been successful at the awards with eight victories and three nominations, followed by paratriathles with two wins and six nominations. The 2017 winner of the Best Female Athlete with a Disability ESPY Award is swimmer Rebecca Meyers. She achieved her second win after receiving the accolade at the 2015 ceremony.  Currently, the accolade is held by American snowboarder Brenna Huckaby after being announced as the winner at the 2018 ceremony.
