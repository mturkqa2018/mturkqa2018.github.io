<p><b>Jason Friedberg</b> (born October 13, 1971) and <b>Aaron Seltzer</b> (born January 12, 1974) are an American-Canadian film director and screenwriter team known for making parody movies that have received extremely unfavorable reviews, but have generally done well at the box office. They have written/directed films such as <i>Spy Hard</i>, <i>Date Movie</i>, <i>Disaster Movie</i> and <i>Vampires Suck</i>.
</p><p>The duo have often been strongly criticized for their style of humor, regarded as lazily capitalizing on passing trends and mistaking scatological humor and fleeting references for jokes. Their work has often been nominated for Golden Raspberry Awards, though the two have never won one themselves. Some of the films the pair have personally written and directed have become regarded as some of the worst films of all time.

<p>Interviews with the duo are rare, but in an exclusive 2014 interview with the publication <i>Grantland</i>, their background was discussed: Seltzer is part of a Canadian shoe salesmen family from Mississauga, Ontario, and Friedberg, who was born in Newark, New Jersey, was raised in Paterson, New Jersey and is the son of director Rick Friedberg. Seltzer and Friedberg met at the University of California, Santa Barbara and bonded over their love of film, especially comedy. Both are Jewish. They did not attend film school, with Seltzer majoring in art history and Friedberg in history, but decided to try a career in the film industry after attending a class about Martin Scorsese in their last semester.

<p>While writing screenplays at night, both spent the day attending jobs to pay their tuition, selling homemade T-shirts, starting their own food delivery service, and opening shoe shops in Los Angeles. When Rick Friedberg made the comic instruction video <i>Bad Golf Made Easier</i> with Leslie Nielsen, he showed his son's script for a spy film spoof to him. Nielsen approved, and this led into 1996's <i>Spy Hard</i>. 
</p><p>Friedberg and Seltzer then spent some years as screenwriters for hire, with Seltzer estimating the duo sold "upward of 40 scripts". The only finished project was  an uncredited rewrite to the Jean-Claude Van Damme film <i>Maximum Risk</i> (1996), while an unproduced Liberace biopic (unrelated to <i>Behind The Candelabra</i>) introduced them to future collaborator and producer Peter Safran. In 1998, Safran managed to sell to Dimension Pictures a horror film spoof spec script of Friedberg and Seltzer's named <i>Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween</i>. Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans, with Buddy Johnson and Phil Beauman, developed a similar project and, thanks to a WGA decision, all six writers were credited on what became <i>Scary Movie</i>, despite Friedberg and Seltzer not actually working on the final script. The film was a sleeper hit in 2000, and brought much attention to Friedberg and Seltzer.

<p>Tired of unmade projects as screenwriters, and with Regency Enterprises unable to find a director for their romantic comedy spoof, Seltzer and Friedberg opted to direct <i>Date Movie</i> (2006) themselves. <i>Date Movie</i> opened with $12.1 million and earned $48.9 million overall. Moving forward, they would direct their own scripts, leading to a long tract of parody films, spoofing major blockbusters. <i>Disaster Movie</i> opened with $5.8 million and earned $14.2 million total in the United States. <i>Vampires Suck</i>, which opened on a Wednesday, earned an estimated $19.7 million in its first five days.

<p>Friedberg and Seltzer announced their intention to release <i>Who the F#@K Took My Daughter?</i>, a parody of <i>Taken</i>. On February 8, 2017, it was  reported they were developing a parody of <i>Star Wars</i> titled <i>Star Worlds Episode XXXIVE=MC2: The Force Awakens The Last Jedi Who Went Rogue</i>. Filming was set for fall 2017, but no news has emerged since.

<div class="quotebox-quote left-aligned" style="">Yes, we all know that a lot of movies put aside the more artistic aspects of film making to solely make a profit; we're not naive. But, the films that these two directors make are so blatant at being nothing more than a juvenile finger pointing at an image or mention of a popular trend that, to me, they seem exploitive of a young culture raised to have an ever-decreasing attention span, thanks to the internet and channel surfing and, this may sound a little crazy, but, I think it shows a slight de-evolution in what people will accept as entertainment.</div>

<p>The critical reception of Friedberg and Seltzer's films has been extremely negative. <i>Disaster Movie</i> and <i>Meet the Spartans</i> were rated the two worst films of 2008 by <i>The Times</i>. Additionally, every film they have directed has made it into Rotten Tomatoes' "Worst of the Worst" for the 2000s, only one scoring a spot outside of the bottom 25. The pair appear more often than any other person on the fan-voted list of "The 50 Worst Movies Ever" in noted British film magazine <i>Empire</i>; almost all of their films appear with a rank, and all are mentioned in the full review text.
</p><p>Flavorwire lists "The Friedberg/Seltzer Oeuvre" at #9 in its list of the 50 worst films of all time, saying: "You may as well lump them all together, because they all bleed together in cinematic hell: the “parody” efforts of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer[...]. They’re sad, limp affairs that have all but single-handedly reduced the “spoof movie” from parody to mere quotation: From <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> to <i>Borat</i> to the “Leave Britney alone!” guy, no payoff delights these comic geniuses more than cutting away to the flavor of the month, presumably causing the audience to roar with laughter, smack themselves on the forehead, and exclaim, “Hot damn, how the hell’d the Kardashians end up in thar? Hyuck, hyuck!”
</p><p>The duo are frequent nominees of the Golden Raspberry Awards. The first was a Worst Screenplay nomination for <i>Epic Movie</i> at the 2007 Razzies and the following year the pair were nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay for both <i>Meet the Spartans</i> and <i>Disaster Movie</i>. At the 2011 Razzies, <i>Vampires Suck</i> was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel.
</p><p>Critic Josh Levin of <i>Slate</i> commented that "Friedberg and Seltzer...are not filmmakers. They are evildoers, charlatans, symbols of Western civilization's decline..." Josh Rosenblatt of <i>The Austin Chronicle</i> said that "Writer/directors Friedberg and Seltzer are a scourge. They're a plague on our cinematic landscape, a national shame, a danger to our culture, a typhoon-sized natural disaster disguised as a filmmaking team, a Hollywood monster wreaking havoc on the minds of America's youth and setting civilization back thousands of years." Austin critic and animator Korey Coleman, of Spill.com and Double Toasted, has claimed that he is "bothered" by the duo's films, as he believes they are dumbing down the film industry and popular culture in general.
</p><p>Critic Nathan Rabin also gave their work an indignant condemnation, calling them "comedy antichrists" and saying about their films:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"Spoof movies, as practiced by the cultural blight that is Seltzer-Friedberg, aren't just troubling from an aesthetic viewpoint. They're horrifying from a moral standpoint as well. The parody of the Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks is defined by love, knowledge, and appreciation: The Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks love, know, and appreciate the source material they're spoofing enough to get all the details perfect. The comedy of Seltzer-Friedberg, in sharp contrast, is defined by contempt: contempt for the attention span, intelligence, maturity, and frame of reference for the audience, and an even more raging contempt for the source material they're spoofing. Friedberg and Seltzer aren't writers; they're comic terrorists who cavalierly destroy what others create for their own ugly self-interest. Their success is entirely dependent on making comedy a dumber, crasser, less dignified place.</p></blockquote>
