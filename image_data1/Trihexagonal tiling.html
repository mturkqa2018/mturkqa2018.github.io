<p>In geometry, the <b>trihexagonal tiling</b> is one of 11 uniform tilings of the Euclidean plane by regular polygons. It consists of equilateral triangles and regular hexagons, arranged so that each hexagon is surrounded by triangles and vice versa. The name derives from the fact that it combines a regular hexagonal tiling and a regular triangular tiling. Two hexagons and two triangles alternate around each vertex, and its edges form an infinite arrangement of lines. Its dual is the rhombille tiling.
</p><p>This pattern, and its place in the classification of uniform tilings, was already known to Johannes Kepler in his 1619 book <i>Harmonices Mundi</i>. The pattern has long been used in Japanese basketry, where it is called <b>kagome</b>. The Japanese term for this pattern has been taken up in physics, where it is called a <b>Kagome lattice</b>. It occurs also in the crystal structures of certain minerals. Conway calls it a <b>hexadeltille</b>, combining alternate elements from a hexagonal tiling (hextille) and triangular tiling (deltille).

<p>It is a weaved arrangement of laths composed of interlaced triangles such that each point where two laths cross has four neighboring points, forming the pattern of a trihexagonal tiling. The weaved process gives the Kagome a chiral wallpaper group symmetry, p6, (632).

<p>The term <b>kagome lattice</b> was coined by Japanese physicist Kôdi Husimi, and first appeared in a 1951 paper by his assistant Ichirō Shōji.
The kagome lattice in this sense consists of the vertices and edges of the trihexagonal tiling.
Despite the name, these crossing points do not form a mathematical lattice.
</p><p>A related three dimensional structure formed by the vertices and edges of the quarter cubic honeycomb, filling space by regular tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra, has been called a <i>hyper-kagome lattice</i>. It is represented by the vertices and edges of the quarter cubic honeycomb, filling space by regular tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra. It contains four sets of parallel planes of points and lines, each plane being a two dimensional kagome lattice. A second expression in three dimensions has parallel layers of two dimensional lattices and is called an <i>orthorhombic-kagome lattice</i>. The trihexagonal prismatic honeycomb represents its edges and vertices.
</p><p>Some minerals, namely jarosites and herbertsmithite, contain two-dimensional layers or three-dimensional kagome lattice arrangement of atoms in their crystal structure. These minerals display novel physical properties connected with geometrically frustrated magnetism. For instance, the spin arrangement of the magnetic ions in Co<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> rests in a kagome lattice which exhibits fascinating magnetic behavior at low temperatures. The term is much in use nowadays in the scientific literature, especially by theorists studying the magnetic properties of a theoretical kagome lattice.

Its symmetries can be described by the wallpaper group p6mm, (*632), and the tiling can be derived as a Wythoff construction within the reflectional fundamental domains of this group.  The trihexagonal tiling is a quasiregular tiling, alternating two types of polygons, with vertex configuration (3.6).

<p>There are 2 regular complex apeirogons, sharing the vertices of the trihexagonal tiling. Regular complex apeirogons have vertices and edges, where edges can contain 2 or more vertices. Regular apeirogons <i>p</i>{<i>q</i>}<i>r</i> are constrained by: 1/<i>p</i> + 2/<i>q</i> + 1/<i>r</i> = 1. Edges have <i>p</i> vertices arranged like a regular polygon, and vertex figures are <i>r</i>-gonal.
</p><p>The first is made of triangular edges, two around every vertex, second has hexagonal edges, two around every vertex.
