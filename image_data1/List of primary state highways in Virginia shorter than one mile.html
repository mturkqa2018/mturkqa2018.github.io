<p><b>State Route 73</b> is the designation for the portion of Parham Road between US 1 and I-95 near the Chamberlayne area of Henrico.  Parham Road is a four-lane divided highway that passes along the west and north side of Richmond from SR 150 near the James River to US 301 just south of I-295. SR 73 was planned and built as a simple trumpet connection between I-95 and US 1; the number was assigned in 1958. The road was completed in 1962; the extension of Parham Road east from I-95 opened in 1978.

<p><b>State Route 209</b> (<b>VA 209</b>) is the mostly unsigned designation for Innovation Avenue, which from 1990 to 2015 ran 0.88 miles (1.42 km) from an intersection with VA 28 (originally a signalized intersection, then from 2007 to 2015 a right-in/right-out interchange with northbound VA 28) east to the Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) on the eastern edge of Loudoun County near Herndon.  At the east end of VA 209, at the line between Loudoun and Fairfax Counties, Innovation Avenue continued east and north as SR 847 to SR 605 (Rock Hill Road).  In Fall 2011, construction began on expansion of the VA 28 interchange to a full interchange.  In January 2016, the entire route (including the VA 28 interchange) was closed in order to complete the full trumpet interchange and to realign the entire highway to access the CIT on its north side, instead of the south. The project was completed in early 2017.
