<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>The <b>Bermuda Bowl</b> is a biennial contract bridge world championship for national teams. It is contested every odd-numbered year under the auspices of the World Bridge Federation (WBF), alongside the Venice Cup (women) and the d'Orsi Bowl (seniors). Entries formally represent WBF zones as well as nations, so it is also known as the <b>World Zonal Open Team Championship</b>. It is the oldest event that confers the title of world champion in bridge, and was first contested in 1950. The Bermuda Bowl trophy is awarded to the winning team, and is named for the site of the inaugural tournament, the Atlantic archipelago of Bermuda.
</p><p>The term <i>Bermuda Bowl</i> is sometimes used for the entire two-week event, comprising the three zonal teams and one or more concurrent lesser tournaments.
</p><p>The 2017 Bermuda Bowl took place in Lyon, France. The 2019 contest will be held in Wuhan, China.

<p>Organized principally by Norman Bach, an accountant and bridge player from Bermuda who played for Britain, the Bermuda Bowl was the first world championship event held after World War II, and started as a competition between the US, Europe and Britain in 1950.
</p><p>The first event was won by the US. After this, the Bermuda Bowl became a yearly challenge match between the US and the European champions. The format evolved progressively, with more teams and the addition of events for women and seniors. Key milestones were:
</p>
<dl><dd><b>1950:</b> The first open team event in Bermuda between the USA, Europe and Britain who played round-robin for raw scores or "total points".</dd>
<dd><b>1951:</b> The next several contests were head-on matches between representatives of the American Contract Bridge League (North America) and the European Bridge League.</dd>
<dd><b>1958:</b> The tournament permanently included the champions of South America.</dd>
<dd><b>1961:</b> Eligibility was expanded to include the defending champions.</dd>
<dd><b>1966:</b> The tournament expanded to five teams, with the addition of a representative from Asia.</dd>
<dd><b>1971:</b> The field was expanded to include Australia.</dd>
<dd><b>1974:</b> The World Bridge Federation inaugurated the Venice Cup for women's teams, contested four times on no fixed schedule before 1985.</dd>
<dd><b>1979:</b> The defending champions were no longer eligible on that basis alone.</dd>
<dd><b>1981:</b> Europe was awarded two places in the tournament. There would be nine teams if every WBF zone sent a champion team.</dd>
<dd><b>1983:</b> North America joined Europe with double representation, and the host country was automatically included too, so the potential size of the field increased by two. European and North American champions would have two places in the four-team semifinal round. European and North American runners up would contend with champions of the other zones and the host country for two other semifinal slots.</dd>
<dd><b>1985:</b> The Bermuda Bowl for open teams and Venice Cup for women would be contested side-by-side in tournaments with the same structure, and in a venue outside Europe and North America (maintained until 2001).</dd></dl>

<p>Austria won the 1937 International Bridge League (IBL) championships for both open and women's national teams. They are commonly considered the first world championships for national teams, and the first world championship tournaments of any kind, because teams from the United States entered both flights, two open teams and one women's.
</p><p>The IBL was a predecessor of both the European Bridge League (est. 1947) and the WBF (est. 1958), although there was a competing international organization in the 1930s. The IBL organized annual championships for (open) national teams beginning in 1932 and for women beginning in 1935. Prior to 1937, Austria won three of five in the open category and both in the women category. All of the sites were in Europe and the European Bridge League considers the 1930s series to be the first eight European Teams Championships.

<p>In the 1937 (June 6–20) open tournament there were 19 teams from 18 countries: the USA had two teams, one led by Ely Culbertson which came second.
</p><p>In the knockout stage, Culbertson beat Norway and Hungary before losing to Austria. USA Minneapolis lost to Austria in the semifinal.(Morehead)
</p><p>World War II practically destroyed the IBL and its nascent world championship tournament series.
</p><p>With Austria the leading nation at the card table, the 1938 Anschluss of Germany and Austria was a great disruption. The leading bridge theorist and mentor Paul Stern was an outspoken opponent of Nazism; he fled to London and later became a British subject. That same year, at least Rixi Scharfstein (Markus) from the Ladies emigrated to Britain; from the Open team at least Karl von Bluhdorn to Paris, Edward Frischauer and Walter Herbert to the United States, eventually California.
</p><p>The International Bridge League organized two more European championships (making eight annual tournaments for national open teams, 1932–1939) but no more tournaments or official matches involving any team from outside Europe.

<p>There was no Bermuda Bowl in 1960, 1964 or 1968 to avoid conflict with the Bridge Olympiad.

<h3><span id="1961_Buenos_Aires.2C_Argentina"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="1961_Buenos_Aires,_Argentina">1961 Buenos Aires, Argentina</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The Blue Team won its fourth Bermuda Bowl, with Benito Garozzo now in the same lineup. This began a new string of annual world championships for Italy, after ranking only sixth in the inaugural World Team Olympiad, won by France.
</p><p>At the same time, the Bermuda Bowl tournament expanded to include the defending champions. Throughout the 1960s that would mean Italy plus one from the rest of Europe. Italy would use the European Team Championships to give some international experience to new players or new partnerships.

<p>Italy defended its championship at home.

<p>The 24th Bermuda Bowl was the first to be decided by a margin that is commonly scored on a single deal, merely 5 IMPs. Malcolm Brachman's professional team of US Americans defeated Italy by that much.
</p><p>The defending champion team was not invited after 1977, so the tournament again matched one team from each WBF geographic zone that chose to participate. The number of teams remained at six because "Central America &amp; the Caribbean" sent a team for the first time, three players from Panama and three from Venezuela with a Guadeloupe captain. Brachman from North America and national teams from Italy, Australia, Taiwan, and host Brazil represented the other four zones.

<p>The Bermuda Bowl made several changes around 1980. The defending champion team was dropped in 1979. For 1981 Europe was awarded two places in the tournament, the first expansion beyond zonal champions (plus the world champion, 1961 to 1977). There would be nine teams if every WBF zone sent a champion. For 1983, European and North American champions would have two places in the 4-team semifinal round. European and North American runners up would contend with champions of the other zones and the host country for two other semifinal slots. (Europe and North America had won all the Bermuda Bowls. Outsiders had finished second in 1969–70 and 1981.) Beginning in 1985, the Bermuda Bowl for open teams and Venice Cup for women would run side-by-side with the same structure in a venue outside Europe and North America (maintained until 2001).

<p>Pakistan represented "Asia and the Middle East", a novelty, and finished second, a shock. This was the third silver medal for teams from outside Europe and North America, joining Taiwan 1969–70. "Pakistani preempts" were notable and team's best player Zia Mahmood was recognized as a great one.
</p><p>For the United States, led by Bud Reinhold—who played, but not enough to qualify personally as a world champion— Levin, Rodwell, and Meckstroth made their international debuts at 23 to 25 years old, Levin being the youngest winner on record.
</p><p>Europe was represented by both Poland and Great Britain, first and second in the 18-team open flight of the European championships.

<p>Beginning in 1983, North America joined Europe with double representation, and the host country was automatically included too, so the potential size of the field increased by two. United States teams finished first and second in North America while France, Italy, and world host Sweden ranked 1, 2, and 7 among 24 teams in the open European championship. Under the new structure, USA1 and France earned byes to the Bermuda Bowl semifinal while USA2, Italy, and Sweden contended with the champions of other zones for two more semifinal slots. Five other zones were represented, ten teams in all.
</p><p>USA2 and Italy won the preliminary stage; USA1 and Italy won semifinal matches to meet in the final, the international swan song for Giorgio Belladonna and for the legendary Belladonna–Garozzo partnership.

In contrast to that three-way competition among teams representing America, Britain, and Europe, there were now eight geographic zones from which twenty teams qualified in numbers influenced by past bridge population and performance.

<p>The final eight segments of 16 deals each started with an insignificant one IMP carryover advantage for Dutch home team. The one IMP represented half the margin in their short match, a 25–23 win for Netherlands in round two.
With a strong third segment, Netherlands surged to a 130–108 lead after one day and then extended the difference to as much as 65 on day two ultimately finishing 55 IMPs ahead after six segments. After day three's seventh segment, the margin increased to 76 IMPs, nearly decisive with only 16 deals to play. The Americans rebounded in the last segment but the gains were "too small" as time ran out.
</p>
<dl><dt>Preliminary</dt></dl>
<p>There were 22 national teams in the field, who represented the eight WBF zones as follows.
The regular quota for Europe is six teams, seven at Veldhoven because the host country qualifies automatically.#
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Europe</b>: Italy, Poland, Israel, Iceland, Sweden, Netherlands, Bulgaria <small>—ranks 1 to 7 in the European championship</small></dd>
<dd><b>North America</b>: Canada, USA 1, USA 2</dd>
<dd><b>South America</b>: Brazil, Chile</dd>
<dd><b>Asia &amp; Middle East</b>: India, Pakistan</dd>
<dd><b>C. America &amp; Carib.</b>: Guadeloupe</dd>
<dd><b>Pacific Asia</b>: China, Japan, Singapore</dd>
<dd><b>South Pacific</b>: Australia, New Zealand</dd>
<dd><b>Africa</b>: Egypt, South Africa</dd></dl>
<p>The first stage was a full round-robin. Every team played 21 short matches of 16 deals, three daily, scheduled in advance.
Italy, Netherlands, USA 2, and Israel earned the first four places comfortably, each almost a full match ahead of the next place. The US champions finished fifth by scoring 340.5 Victory Points, or 16.2 per match where a draw is worth 15. Sweden, China, and Iceland qualified with fewer than 16 VP per match while Japan, New Zealand, and Australia made strong showings as the first three also-rans, ahead of two Europeans, Poland and Bulgaria.
(All six Europeans had qualified for knockout play two years earlier.)
</p><p>Italy, Netherlands, and USA 2 selected quarterfinal opponents China, Iceland, and Sweden leaving Israel to face USA 1. Italy and China, second and fourth in 2009, played the only close match, where Italy built a 5 IMP lead to 26 during the last segment. During the same segment Sweden trailed USA 2 by at least 30, Iceland trailed by almost 100, and Israel conceded to USA 1 without play.
</p><p>Two US American entries in a Zonal Teams knockout always meet in one semifinal match, if they survive so long (and they never meet earlier).# In Veldhoven a strong fifth segment was almost decisive for USA 2, who extended a lead from 12 to 62 IMP with 16 deals to play, and won by 60. Meanwhile, Italy and Netherlands were nearly even at the end of every segment, the only time players know the score precisely. After five Netherlands led by 3+ IMP including 2+ carryover, having bettered Italy 155 to 154 on 80 deals. They "won" the final segment by 26 and the match by 199+ to 170.
In retrospect, two "slam swings" were decisive. On the 87th and 90th deals (#23, #29), Netherlands bid 6<span class="spades" style="color:black" title="spades">♠</span> and 6<span class="hearts" style="color: red" title="hearts">♥</span> while Italy bid 4<span class="spades" style="color:black" title="spades">♠</span> and 4<span class="hearts" style="color: red" title="hearts">♥</span>. All four declarers took the twelve tricks for slam, worth twice 13 IMP for the winners.

</p><p>While Netherlands and USA 2 played for the Bowl, Italy easily beat the US champions in 48 deals and earned the bronze medal, 167–69.

<p>Italy won its 15th Bermuda Bowl with a 210–126 defeat of Monaco, represented by Pierre Zimmermann's immigrant professional team. Poland won the bronze medal by a fraction less than 5 IMPs.

<p>The two-week tournament in Chennai, India  (formerly Madras), began on Sunday, 27 September, with one week of round-robin play through Saturday, 3 October.
During the preceding month, revelations of cheating by two of the leading pairs, at events including the 2014 European Team Championships, had led to withdrawal from the Bermuda Bowl by the Israel and Monaco teams that had placed first and second in that event. Germany had dropped from the 22-team field after one of its three pairs confessed "preemptively". On the last day before the first matches in Chennai, the World Bridge Federation had announced its withdrawal of credentials for one of three pairs on the Poland team, making that pair ineligible to play. (Two pairs from each team participate in each segment.)
</p><p>The Bermuda Bowl was won by Poland, who defeated Sweden in the final by 308.5 IMPs to 293. The bronze medal went to USA2, who defeated England in the third-place match 252.3 to 243.
