When Grace finds out that Will, acting as tenant board president, is the only tenant with a working fireplace, she decides to run against him in the upcoming election and take him down a notch or two in arrogance. They run an ugly race, slandering each other and buying vote, and in the end Grace wins when the two of them pester the last tenant for his vote while he's in his hospital room. But Grace isn't sure she wants the position when Will actually seems psyched to not have the job anymore, and she starts being pestered by all the tenants. Karen lets Guapo, the parrot out the window by mistake, and goes on a buying spree for Jack to make it up to him. When Guapo comes back, Jack hides the bird in the closet so that he can keep getting expensive gifts from Karen. Karen finally gives him the keys to an expensive boat, and he finally feels so guilty that he tells her what he did, and then she tells him that she actually knew all the time because she had video cameras everywhere. And the keys are only to Grace's office anyway.</td></tr>

Grace is written up in the newspaper with an accompanying picture that makes her look much bustier than she actually is. When an old high school crush calls her and asks her out, she is incredibly excited until Karen points out that she'll now have to live up her published dimensions. With Karen's help she buys a water-filled bra that makes her look much larger up front than she is, but she springs some leaks while on her date at the art gallery and has to admit to her crush that she's wearing a water-bra. He calls her too shallow for his taste and quickly ditches her. Jack finds out that Will hooked up with his ex-boyfriend Walter and dumps Will as a friend because Walter was the love of his life. Will feels terrible, and tries to arrange a reconciliation between Jack and Walter, but when he does so it turns out that Jack was thinking about someone else and he isn't interested in Walter at all.</td></tr>

Grace's mom comes to town and Grace is scared that her mom will try to set her up again. It turns out, however, that her mom is more interested in setting up Will with someone. Grace looks at this as an opportunity to show her mother how bad she is at setting people up, but is horrified when Will actually gets along with the guy. Grace finally admits that even though she's been telling her mom to stop setting her up for years now, she feels bad that her mother has actually stopped. Jack and Rosario are being interviewed by the INS to make sure their greencard marriage is for real, but it turns out their interviewer is somebody that Jack has met and hooked up with before. Luckily, Jack makes a big show of his love for Rosario, and the INS officers passes them just for trying so hard.</td></tr>

Will's ego inflates after closing a major deal for Harlin, and he decides to focus solely on the millionaire's business by dumping all of the smaller clients who supported him when he first became a lawyer.

Jack challenges Will to become a cater-waiter on his staff, but when Will finds out that the catered event is for the American Bar Association, he backs out and joins the dinner guests. However, when one of Will's acquaintances starts treating Jack horribly, Will stands up for his friend and rejoins the wait staff. Grace finds out that Karen once starred in a fetish video, causing Karen to be so embarrassed that she quits her job as Grace's assistant. Grace placates Karen by finding and buying all the copies of the video and giving them to Karen... but of course she keeps one for herself.</td></tr>
