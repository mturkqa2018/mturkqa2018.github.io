<p>In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began studies and tests on low visibility ship camouflage. Research continued through World War II to (1) reduce visibility by painting vertical surfaces to harmonize with the horizon and horizontal surfaces to blend with the sea, or (2) confuse identity and course by painting obtrusive patterns on vertical surfaces. Some camouflage methods served both purposes.  American captains were permitted less freedom of interpretation with these schemes (other than Measure 12 Modified) than their British Commonwealth counterparts applied to Admiralty camouflage schemes.

<p>With the likelihood of the United States entering the war, and after experiments with various paint schemes conducted in association with the 1940 Fleet Problem (exercise), the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) directed in January 1941 that the peacetime color of overall #5 Standard Navy Gray, a light gloss shade with a linseed-oil base, be replaced with matte Dark Gray, #5-D, a new paint formulation with a synthetic alkyd resin base.  Rather than waste the large quantities of Standard Gray already in inventory and aboard ships, BuShips directed the issuance of a black tinting paste (5-BP) which when mixed in stated proportions with Standard Gray would yield a close approximation of 5-D, with issue of the new paint in pre-mixed form to follow. BuShips also issued <i>Ship Camouflage Instructions</i> (SHIPS-2), laying out 9 painting schemes to be used throughout the Navy. Rather than issue premixed quantities of the less-used new shades, Light Gray (5-L) and Ocean Gray (5-O), yards and supply depots were directed to issue an untinted base paint (5-U) together with a blue-black tinting material (5-TM) which when mixed according to instructions would turn 5-U into either Light or Ocean Gray.

<p>The adoption of the new measures was very slow, however: as of late May the Navy's paint factories had yet  to receive the ingredients needed for the new alkyd-based paints and only in late April had they received even the lampblack required for conversion paste 5-BP.

Horizontal surfaces were as Measure 1, Dark Gray except for wooden decks. This measure was also widely used by the Royal Navy where it became known as the emergency scheme or Admiralty alternative scheme when there was insufficient time or where required pigments were unavailable to apply an Admiralty disruptive scheme.

<p>By the summer of 1941 it had become apparent that Dark Gray (5-D) was unacceptably visible under all conditions, and the "conversion" 5-D made from prewar #5 was also too glossy and prone to chipping and peeling; meanwhile Pacific Fleet experiments with new colors Sea Blue and Sapphire Blue were deemed successful. Accordingly, in JulyâAugust Dark Gray was discontinued and new paint formulas Sea Blue (5-S) and Haze Gray (5-H) were implemented, together with Deck Blue (20-B) for all horizontals, steel and wood alike. The tinting paste was altered to contain somewhat less black and more blue than before; this meant that Ocean Gray also became somewhat more bluish in cast at this time and all the 5-series paint colors now were categorized as Munsell 5 Purple-Blue. Until 1945 all USN "gray" and almost all "blue" shades were produced using this same blue-black tint (5-TMa), so that the paints represented different tones of what was effectively a single blue-gray hue.

<p>In September, Measures 1 through 8 were abolished and four new schemes promulgated in a revised edition of SHIPS-2. On 19 July Measure 12 had been prescribed for the entire Atlantic Fleet, and on 13 September Measure 11 for the Pacific. However, there was considerable time lag between the issuance of new instructions, and paint being manufactured and distributed and ships actually being repainted; at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941 most of the Pacific Fleet was still wearing dark gray Measure 1.
</p><p>In November aircraft carriers began applying a dark blue-gray flight deck stain (#250) approximately the same color as Deck Blue, together with a stain approximately Ocean Gray for flight deck markings (#251).

<td>Sea Blue on the hull up to the main deck (hangar deck on aircraft carriers), Ocean Gray from main deck level to the top of the superstructure masses, and Haze Gray (5-H) for masts and other vertical projections above superstructure level. Horizontal surfaces painted Deck Blue. Canvas dyed blue. Sea Blue was later darkened to Navy Blue (Measure 12A). It was found to be ineffective against aerial observation during the early carrier aircraft battles of Coral Sea and Midway, so all-blue Measure 11 and its replacement Measure 21 became preferred in the Pacific.
<p>In Measure 12 (Modified), irregular patches or splotches were added to break up the ship's profile: Haze Gray splotches on Sea Blue (later Navy Blue) and vice versa, and Sea Blue (later Navy Blue) splotches on Ocean Gray. "These splotches should be obtained by extending the Navy Blue paint into the designated Ocean Gray paint area and vice versa. They should be about 1/3 the area of a rectangle 12 feet high by 20 feet long." There were no specific instructions on the positioning or shape of the splotches, which were left up to individual captains, yards or maintenance facilities, and the recommended size was frequently disregarded, so that no two ships looked alike.  Measure 12 (Mod) was used extensively in both fleets during 1942. Unfortunately the splotches in most cases were too small to break up the ship's outline effectively, and at any distance resolved into simple gray.

<td>White with large polygonal patches of light sea blue (called Thayer Blue.) This measure was most useful in Arctic latitudes with extended twilight and frequent fog and cloud cover. "Especially well adapted for winter use in Northern areas where nights are long and days frequently overcast. It would prove useful against submarines in any area where attacks occur mostly at night." Purity of color was important for full realization of the Purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination. Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze. This measure was used extensively through 1943 and early 1944 in North Atlantic and Aleutian waters until replaced by Measure 33. Captain-class frigates were delivered to the Royal Navy wearing this measure sometimes identified as the American Western Approaches camouflage scheme.

Overall Navy Blue (5-N), with decks in dark Deck Blue (20-B). This measure was used extensively in the western and southern Pacific from September 1942 through 1945 to minimize detection and identification by enemy aircraft. "Useful where greatest danger is from the air and high surface visibility must be accepted... Lowest visibility to aerial observers day and night in all types of weather. Low visibility under searchlight. High visibility to all surface observers in all types of weather." Measure 21 also proved effective under artificial illumination during night actions. Upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier decks were painted a similar shade of blue. Sailors were ordered to wear dungarees rather than white uniforms when topside, and white "Dixie cup" hats were dyed blue. USSÂ <i>Texas</i> is, as of 2017, painted in Measure 21 as she was in 1945.

<td>MeasureÂ 22</td>
<td>Measure 12 was reworked following recognition of the ineffectiveness of small splotches of paint, and the relatively low contrast between the shades used. Replacement measure 22 used Navy Blue low on the hull below the first continuous deck, with Haze Gray above that. Measure 22 used a straight horizontal boundary between the two colors rather than following the sheer of the main deck, making a characteristic gray "wedge" at the bow. This bold contrast at a horizontal line near the horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created the illusion of greater range. This measure largely replaced Measure 12 where aerial observation was unlikely. "Useful for combatant ships operating in areas where greatest danger might be expected from gunnery action either from shore batteries or from enemy surface ships. Moderately high visibility to aerial observation at close ranges." This measure was used in the Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of World War II, and was often referred to as "Atlantic two-tone." It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the Battle of the Philippine Sea.
<p><br/>
Due to the desire for a darker version for greater utility against air attack after the appearance of the kamikaze, Measure 12 was revived in 1945, but amended so as to be identical to Measure 22 save for the use of Ocean Gray rather than Haze Gray.

<p><b>Tropic Green system:</b> Through 1942 the Camouflage Section had issued no instructions for landing craft, PT boats, Tank Landing Ships (LSTs) and other vessels expected to operate close inshore in Pacific jungle conditions, so individual commands resorted to overall green, or ad-hoc camouflage patterns in whatever green or brown paints could be obtained. In early 1943 BuShips began the development a green series parallel to the blue-gray series, but the process was slow and therefore the South Pacific Command as an expedient ordered its amphibious vessels to be repainted in Dark Tropic Green with "tiger stripes" in Light Tropic Green, both of which could be created by mixing standard 5-TMa blue tinting medium with yellow zinc chromate primer. According to a contemporary report, "The color of the foliage [in the vicinity of Bougainville] was surprisingly high in key, a brilliance that would have been unbelievable except for the very same observations made on first arrival in the Solomons group."

<p>The British Royal Navy established an Admiralty camouflage section in October 1940. Initial Admiralty disruptive camouflage schemes employed polygons of multiple shades of gray, blue and green so at least two of the colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions. Experience showed the polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges. Simplified Admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors.
</p><p>Artist Everett Warner, who had headed the design section of Navy Camouflage during the First World War, returned to that post during the Second. On the basis of Warner's interpretations of recent Admiralty experience, BuShips issued a supplement to SHIPS-2 in March 1943 laying out multiple dazzle patterns under Measures 31 (dark), 32 (medium) and 33 (light) to conceal identity and confuse submarine torpedo fire control. Each measure included multiple pattern designs for ship classes so the pattern would not identify the class of ship. These measures represent the final evolution of dazzle camouflage.
</p><p>Warner's office issued over 300 pattern sheets for Measures 31-33. Specific patterns in the dazzle measures were designated as, e.g., MS-32/3D, meaning the <b>3</b>rd <b>D</b>estroyer pattern under Measure 32; an A indicated an aircraft carrier pattern, B for battleships, C for cruisers and so on. Often a pattern designed for one ship type would be adapted to another, so that, for example, the battleship <i>North Carolina</i> wore an adaptation of Measure 32/18D, originally a destroyer pattern. Some patterns could be used as Measure 31, 32 or 33 depending on the paints chosen; these were listed as, e.g.,  MS-3_/6D.
</p><p>On 15 September 1943 the South Pacific command adopted the dazzle measures for all ships; in October the Pacific Fleet officially adopted the dazzle measures for most of its remaining ships.

<td>MeasureÂ 31 <br/>(Disruptive system, dark)</td>
<td>Dark pattern Measure 31 was a series of irregular geometric patterns using large polygonal and striped patterns of Black and Ocean Gray, or Black, Ocean Gray and Haze Gray. The patterns and tones were designed to resolve at a distance to an average low reflectivity of 10-20%. Horizontal surfaces also carried irregular patterns in Ocean Gray and Deck Blue. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. Undersides of horizontal elements were countershaded in Pale Gray (5-P) or White (5-U) to reduce self-shadowing. This measure was based on the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific.
<p>In 1944 revised Measure 31a substituted Navy Blue for Black and eliminated countershading

<td>For landing craft and amphibious vessels, BuShips promulgated patterns under Measure 31/L, which was based on Measure 31 but used the colors Haze Green, Ocean Green, Navy Green, Brown 4A and Black with Deck Green. In mid-1944 the color range was simplified (Measure 31/20L) to Green #1, #2 and #3 and Brown #4.
<p>Measure 31/5P for PT boats used a base color of MTB Green with large patches of Navy Green (5-NG). Measure 31/4P combined Ocean Green (5-OG) with Navy Blue. Measure 31/T for amphibious transports was identical to base Measure 31 but used Ocean Green, Navy Green and Black.

<td>MeasureÂ 32<br/>(Disruptive system, medium)</td>
<td>Medium pattern Measure 32 was similar to Measure 31 but somewhat lighter, a mixture of obtrusive polygons in Black against background polygons of Light Gray, or Light Gray and Ocean Gray. The patterns and tones were designed to resolve at a distance to an average medium reflectivity of 20-30%. Measure 32 was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944, but in 1945 the Pacific Fleet reverted to Measure 12, 21 or 22 in the revised 1945 colors.
<p>As with Measure 31, there were also amphibious-craft patterns under MS-32/L in Light Green, Ocean Green, Brown 4A and Black.
</p><p>Measures 32/3SS and 32/9SS were submarine patterns that used a multiplicity of carefully shaded grays to counteract light and shadow and reduce the visibility of a submarine on the surface.

<p>In January 1945 BuShips revised its paint formulations due to a shortage of blue pigment, and the realization that tone was far more important than hue in camouflage effect, eliminating the blue-purple shades which had characterized nearly all Navy ship colors whether called "blue" or "gray."  The new paints were neutral grays, Navy Gray replacing Navy Blue (but confusingly receiving the designation "5-N" while Navy Blue became "5-NB"), and Deck Gray replacing Deck Blue. Ocean Gray and Haze Gray retained their names but lost their bluish cast. However, the new paints (which were shipped pre-mixed, not as tinting paste) were generally only available in stateside yards, while ships repainted at forward bases continued to use the older bluish colors. Moreover, for Measure 22 (but not 12 or 21), Navy Blue was still prescribed until existing stocks were exhausted.

<p>In February the Pacific Fleet, deciding that the primary threat to its ships was now kamikaze, directed that all ships be repainted in Measure 12, 21 or 22, and dazzle schemes began to disappear again. All auxiliaries and <i>odd</i>-numbered cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons and destroyer-escort divisions were to be painted in Measure 21, and all <i>even</i>-numbered CA/CL divisions, DD squadrons and DE divisions in Measure 22. Ironically, the Atlantic Fleet did not get the memo, and during 1945 ships scheduled for Pacific transfer were repainted in dazzle, only to be painted again in Measure 21 or 22 on arrival at the West Coast or Hawaii.

However, in summer 1943 the <i>New Orleans</i>-class cruiser <i>Minneapolis</i> received a unique variant of Measure 8 designed to disguise her as a <i>Benson</i>-class destroyer. "This was done by painting the ship overall in Light Gray 5-L, painting on a false deck break &amp; bridge windows in Dull Black BK and then using Ocean Gray 5-O for counter-shading to optically reduce the width of the superstructure and funnels. The camouflage was polished off by painting two huge Carley rafts on each side."</span>
