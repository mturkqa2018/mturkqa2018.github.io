<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alex_Welch">Alex Welch</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Alex Welch, commonly referred to as BGirl Shorty or Shorty, born October 21, 1989 in Orlando, Florida, but raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. She is the youngest of the crew members, but said to be the most hyper and energetic of them all. Both her parents are professional ballet dancers, but she claims that when she was younger she hated dancing and strongly disliked going to the studio with her parents and seeing tutus. However, when she was 11 years old she saw a headspin during a Christina Aguilera music video and was fascinated by it. She quickly began to learn breaking and grew to love dance, learning as many different styles as she could. She said prior to joining Beat Freaks, she looked up to them and dreamed of being in the crew; however, she knew they were not recruiting. That quickly changed when she found out the crew was in fact looking for an additional member that could step in for Alison during the third season of <i>America's Best Dance Crew</i>. When she joined, she said it was like a dream come true. Welch appeared in the films, such as <i>Stick It</i>, <i>Date Movie</i>, <i>Step Up 2: The Streets</i>, <i>Bring It On: All or Nothing</i>, <i>Prom Night</i> and <i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</i>. She has worked with Pink and Miley Cyrus. Welch make appearances in the TeenNick show, The Nightlife and Disney's, <i>Shake It Up</i>. As an individual dancer, Welch has appeared in four music videos: Toni Braxton's "Make My Heart", Jennifer Lopez's "Live It Up", Ariana Grande's "Baby I" and "It's On" by the cast of <i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</i>. Welch was a backup dancer of Britney Spears' Femme Fatate World Tour and she was part of the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert tour with the Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato and the cast of <i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</i> for promoting the film, <i>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</i>. Welch considered taking legal action lawsuit against Demi Lovato, after a confrontation with her led to Lovato punching Welch in the face on tour. In late December 2010, Welch and Lovato settled the claim and Welch received less than $100,000.
After two years since the incident, Welch apologized to Lovato and she accepted, saying the words "I'm thankful for forgiveness".

<p>Beat Freaks are runners-up for the third season of America's Best Dance Crew; losing to Quest Crew. Beat 
Freaks were the first all-female crew to make it to the finals of the competition and received much praise from judges JC Chasez, Lil Mama, and 
Shane Sparks. During the season they were recognized by their large banner with the logo of a bright-yellow boombox. Their signature is 
considered to be the V hand signal, which in the U.S. means "peace". During World War II the sign was used by Winston Churchill as a sign
for "Victory."

<p>The Beat Freaks spent much of their on-air time encouraging young girls to dance and follow their dreams. Coming on to the show they came up with a 
campaign called "Freak the Vote." Knowing that Freak the Vote would only apply on ABDC they decided to come up with something that 
would carry on even after the show. After discussing and collaborating as a group, they came up with "Freak the Dream."
</p><p>The Beat Freaks' Illusion Challenge performance placed 6th on the Top 10 America's Best Dance Crew Performances of All Time.
