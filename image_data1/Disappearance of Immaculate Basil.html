<p>Mackie Basil was the daughter of Samuel Basil and Patricia Joseph, and mother of Jamison, who was 5 years old when she disappeared.  Mackie had three sisters and three brothers: Crystal, Ida, Samantha (deceased), Nick, Peter and Travis (deceased).  Mackie grew up from a young age in the foster care system with her sisters Ida and Crystal. Ida says that their experience in foster care bonded them, and that it drew them together; they  called each other daily at 10 am. Mackie was part of the Tl'azt'en Nation, based out of Tachie, south of the Kuz Che Reserve. Mackie lived in Fort St. James at the time of her disappearance, working part-time as a secretary, and as a teacher's assistant at the school. Mackie had recently split from her long time partner and father to her son.

<p>Mackie was an introvert who rarely partied and was not known to drink or do drugs. It was a surprise to family that she was going to a party alone and drinking; she was very selective as to who she spent time with and preferred to spend time at home cleaning, decorating, completing tasks, spending time online, talking with her sisters or spending time with her son. She would often make porridge for her son and put frozen huckleberries in the bowl; her son was very important to her. Ida said of Mackie that she was a "caring, beautiful person" and that "she'd help out in any way she can if you asked her for help".

<p>Mackie had recently separated with her common law husband just before the time of her disappearance. News of the breakup was a surprise to the family. The cause of the separation is unknown. It is not public knowledge how long she was with her husband, but he was the father of her son Jamison.

<p>The events leading up to Mackie's disappearance are not entirely known, but she was seen at a house party on Tachie reserve before she left with a man named Victor and her cousin Keith shortly after midnight. It is not substantiated, but it was reported that she was attempting to hitchhike alone after the truck that she was in got into an accident.
</p><p>Mackie was not driving a vehicle at the time of her disappearance. Mackie, uncharacteristically for an overnight trip, didn't bring her makeup bag or an extra set of clothes, and didn't own a cell phone. Mackie was reported to have been wearing grey yoga (capri) pants, white shoes and a black hoodie with a maple leaf on the front. Also, a dark blue iPod Shuffle with white earphones is missing with Mackie. None of the items that went missing with Mackie were ever found.
</p><p>Mackie attended a house party on Thursday, June 13, 2013, in Tachie. It is not public knowledge who was at the party that night, or how many people were there, but Vanessa Joseph believes that it was mostly Mackie's cousins. Mackie's cousin Keith, and a man named Victor, who was known to Vanessa, were also at the party. The party was located a 20 minute walk from Mackie's house.

<p>Large portions of Mackie's timeline the night that she went missing are not public knowledge. This is because she was alone for much of the night and after midnight, she left with a man named Victor and her cousin Keith, who haven't made public what happened that night.

<p>According to RCMP's report to the family, Victor and Keith reported that they were riding in a white truck with Mackie the night of the disappearance. Sometime early on June 14, 2013, the white truck that Keith, Victor, and allegedly Mackie, were traveling in got into an accident on Leo Creek Forest Service Road between Tachie and Kuzche, near a place called "16 kilometer." The accident happened while the truck was traveling away from the cabin. Vanessa said the accident was apparent because there were parts of the white truck near a tree that was broken in half. Vanessa said that she learned that an attempt was made to get a black truck at the hunter's cabin in Kuzche to pull the white truck. Victor and Keith both told the RCMP that Mackie separated from them after the accident. RCMP press releases indicated that Mackie separated from the two other men shortly after their truck got stuck in the mud.

<p>At about 10 am on Friday, June 14, 2013 Victor was seen walking down the street in Tachie wearing clothes that were wet up to his chest. Vanessa, Joseph and Ron saw this in front of Ron's house. They thought it was strange, but not knowing that Mackie was missing, didn't investigate further. After learning that the white truck that Victor was driving was in an accident near Kuzche, Vanessa considered it odd that Victor would be back in Tachie so soon, on foot. The black truck from the hunting cabin was not driven back to Tachie but was left on Leo Creek Forest Service Road, which was an hour away by vehicle from where Victor was seen walking.

<p>Both Victor and Keith were given polygraph tests. RCMP reported to the family that they were both cooperative. They were also interviewed by a forensic psychologist. After this, the psychologist's report to the family stated that they found nothing suspicious. Vanessa believes that the police interviewed everyone involved.
</p><p>No one revealed to the family that Mackie left the party with Keith and Victor until after police interviews on 18 June 2013, when RCMP disclosed this fact to the family.
</p><p>According to relatives, the family did not hear much from the RCMP in the first year after she went missing,  though the RCMP issued a press release to the public on the third anniversary of Mackie's disappearance.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Search_effort">Search effort</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>RCMP were part of the search effort for about a week after 18 June 2013. They used dogs in the search effort. There was a hailstorm and unfavorable rainy weather for searching in the weekend of 22 June 2013. Extensive ground and air efforts were made to search for Mackie in the days after her disappearance. These initial searches were carried out by numerous search and rescue organizations, RCMP air services, relatives and locals. In the time since search efforts have been made only by search and rescue and the Tl'azt'en band. An approximate 20 km radius area was searched in the area around Tachie/Kuzche.

<p>Tl'azt'en nation, which includes the communities of Tachie, Kuzche, Binche and Dzitl’ainli, is located on the north-eastern shore of Stewart Lake, BC. Tachie is about 45 minutes north of Fort St. James and Kuzche is located about 45 minutes north of Tachie. The area consists of numerous rivers, ponds, lakes, rolling hills and lakes. Most of the land is covered in forest. The area has one main highway to Fort St. James, numerous logging roads and a railway that runs through the area and through both Tachie and Kuzche. Both Tachie and Kuzche are accessible by road as well. Industry in the area consists mainly of mining and logging. The railroad is no longer in use and the local sawmill, owned by Tanizul Timber, has been shut down since before Mackie's disappearance. Geology consists of numerous types of igneous and metamorphic rocks and their related soils. Various animals are known to the area, including moose, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, cougar, sheep, mountain goat, black and grizzly bear, coyote, wolf and woodland caribou.

<p>Numerous posters, billboards and news articles have gone up in an effort to raise awareness about Mackie's disappearance. The RCMP released numerous press releases, including one on the month of the three year anniversary of Mackie's disappearance. In 2016, shortly after the third anniversary RCMP press release, the Tl'azt'en nation has also offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Mackie's discovery at the behest of Peter Basil, Mackie's brother.

<p>Due to family connections and a young child whom Mackie was known to be affectionate to, in addition to no history of running away, it is considered unlikely that Mackie ran away. Although they are skeptical that Mackie ran away, RCMP are hesitant to attribute her disappearance to foul play. This leaves animal attack or accident as possible explanations for Mackie's disappearance.
</p><p>Though they haven't confirmed it, the RCMP haven't ruled out the possibility of foul play playing a role in the disappearance of Mackie Basil.

<p>Although it is true that there are numerous dangerous wild animals that are known to live in the area around Tachie/Kuzche, the theory of an animal attack is brought into question due to the lack of evidence of an attack found by the searchers who did a thorough ground and air search of about a 20 km radius. There was no confirmed discovery of any of the items that Mackie had when she went missing, nor was there any discovery of blood or other remains confirmed to be Mackie's. If Mackie went missing due to an accident or misadventure, then it is reasonable to presume that she would have walked to where she met her demise. This would have been well within the range of the search party who were looking for her remains. No remains were ever found.
</p><p>A number of unsubstantiated rumors and inconsistent reports happened after Mackie went missing. The RCMP followed up on many of these and reported to Mackie's family their findings.
</p>

<p>Mackie was reported to have been seen on the morning of June 14, 2013 by either forestry workers, tree planters or a truck driver. This rumor says that she was seen attempting to hitchhike. The RCMP followed up with these claims and determined that they were false.
</p><p>Another false sighting was near Saik'uz reserve, south of Vanderhoof.

<p>Allegedly Mackie was riding with two men, Keith and Victor, in a white pickup truck at the time of her disappearance, they were heading to a hunter's cabin near Kuz Che reserve to pick up some unused roofing tin to deliver to an elder. This story was only substantiated by Keith and Victor with no other witnesses.
</p><p>Neither Keith nor Victor has talked with the family about exactly what happened the night of the disappearance. Keith is younger than Mackie. Victor was reported to have been mean to his ex-wife. Victor was not from Tachie. Victor was about 48 years old at the time of the disappearance and has a history of convictions for violent crime (files 22683-1-K, 24087-1-KC, 25237-2-A, 27961-6-C and 29420-1) and at least one charge of sexual assault (file 27961-6-C). Most of these crimes had resulting court appearances in the Dease Lake court.
</p><p>Considering the remoteness of the area and the timing in which Mackie disappeared, it is unlikely that she disappeared due to a stranger abduction.  However, it should be noted that according to the FBI, stranger abductions involving women mostly are motivated by sexual assault and are also the most likely to involve the use of a firearm.

<p>Mackie disappeared in an area that is part of the Highway of Tears corridor.  Mackie's cousin Bonnie Marie Joseph went missing along the Highway of Tears corridor as well. Bonnie was last seen hitchhiking east towards Prince George from Vanderhoof on Saturday, September 8, 2007. She was last seen by her cousin Joanne.
