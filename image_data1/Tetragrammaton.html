<p>The letters YHWH are consonants. In unpointed Biblical Hebrew, most vowels are not written and the rest are written only ambiguously, as certain consonants can double as vowel markers (similar to the Latin use of V to indicate both U and V). These are referred to as matres lectionis ("mothers of reading"). Therefore, in general, it is difficult to deduce how a word is pronounced only from its spelling, and the tetragrammaton is a particular example: two of its letters can serve as vowels, and two are vocalic place-holders, which are not pronounced. 
</p><p>The original consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible was, several centuries later, provided with vowel marks by the Masoretes to assist reading. In places that the consonants of the text to be read (the <i>qere</i>) differed from the consonants of the written text (the <i>ketiv</i>), they wrote the <i>qere</i> in the margin as a note showing what was to be read. In such a case the vowels of the <i>qere</i> were written on the <i>ketiv</i>. For a few frequent words, the marginal note was omitted: these are called qere perpetuum.
</p><p>One of the frequent cases was the tetragrammaton, which according to later Jewish practices should not be pronounced but read as "Adonai" ("My Lord"), or, if the previous or next word already was Adonai, as "Elohim" ("God"). The combination produces <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô÷∞◊î÷π◊ï÷∏◊î</span>‚Äé and <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô÷±◊î÷π◊ï◊î</span>‚Äé respectively, non-words that would spell "Yehovah" and "Yehovih" respectively.
</p><p>The oldest complete or nearly complete manuscripts of the Masoretic Text with Tiberian vocalisation, such as the <i>Aleppo Codex</i> and the <i>Leningrad Codex</i>, both of the 10th or 11th century, mostly write <link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049626" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><span class="script-hebrew" dir="rtl" style="font-size: 115%;">◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷∏◊î</span> (<i>yhwah</i>), with no pointing on the first <i>h</i>. It could be because the <i>o</i> diacritic point plays no useful role in distinguishing between <i>Adonai</i> and <i>Elohim</i> and so is redundant,  or it could point to the <i>qere</i> being <i>Shema</i>, which is Aramaic for "the Name".

<p>The Hebrew scholar Wilhelm Gesenius [1786‚Äì1842] suggested that the Hebrew punctuation <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô÷∑◊î÷∞◊ï÷∂◊î</span>‚Äé, which is transliterated into English as <i>Yahweh</i>, might more accurately represent the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton than the Masoretic punctuation "<span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô÷∞◊î÷π◊ï÷∏◊î</span>‚Äé", from which the English name <i>Jehovah</i> has been derived. His proposal to read <i>YHWH</i> as "<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049626" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><span class="script-hebrew" dir="rtl" style="font-size: 115%;">◊ô÷∑◊î÷∞◊ï÷∂◊î</span>" (see image to the left) was based in large part on various Greek transcriptions, such as ŒπŒ±Œ≤Œµ, dating from the first centuries CE but also on the forms of theophoric names. In his <i>Hebrew Dictionary,</i> Gesenius supports <i>Yahweh</i> (which would have been pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[jahwe]</span>, with the final letter being silent) because of the Samaritan pronunciation <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ŒôŒ±Œ≤Œµ</span> reported by Theodoret, and because the theophoric name prefixes <i>YHW</i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[jeho]</span> and <i>YW</i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[jo]</span>, the theophoric name suffixes <i>YHW</i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[jahu]</span> and <i>YH</i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[jah]</span>, and the abbreviated form <i>YH</i> <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[jah]</span> can be derived from the form <i>Yahweh</i>.

</p><p>The Elephantine papyri, on which the jhw form appears, with the form of jhh are found on Elephantine. One time jh also appears, but originally it was a form of jhw in which the final letter in (Hebrew waw) disappeared. In eight cases, the tetragram occurs in the formula of the oath: "God's jhh".
</p><p>God's name appears in the Greek magical texts, the formation of which was established between the second century BCE to CE. It takes the following forms: Ieoa, Iaoa, Iaoai, Iaoouee, Ioa, Iao, Iaeo, Iaee, Ieou, Iaba, Iabas, Iabo, Iabe, Iaon.
</p><p>God's name in the form of ·º∏Œ±·ø∂ (Iao) appears in: Diodorus Siculus, Marcus Terentius Varro according to the message of John the Lydian (<i>De Mensibus</i>, 4.53), Pedanius Dioscorides, Aelius Herodian, Hesychius of Alexandria.
</p><p>A form of the name appears on the following Egyptian inscriptions: on the list of Amenhotep III discovered in the Temple of Amon in Soleb and in its copy from the time of Ramesses II in West Amara (recorded: yhw3, read: ja-h-wi or ja-h-wa), and on the list of places in the temple of Ramesses III in Medinet Habu (as ji-ha or ja-h-wi).

<p>The oldest known inscription of the tetragrammaton dates to 840¬†BCE, on the Mesha Stele. It bears the earliest certain extra-biblical reference to the Israelite God <i>Yahweh</i>. The most recent discovery of a tetragrammaton inscription, dating to the 6th century BCE, was found written in Hebrew on two silver scrolls recovered from Jerusalem.
</p><p><b> Magical papyri </b>
</p><p>The spellings of the tetragrammaton occur among the many combinations and permutations of names of powerful agents that occur in Jewish magical papyri found in Egypt. One of these forms is the heptagram <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ŒπŒ±œâŒøœÖŒ∑Œµ</span>. In the Jewish magical papyri, <i>Iave</i> and <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">IŒ±Œ≤Œ±</span> <i>Yaba</i> occurs frequently. Among the Jews in the Second Temple Period magical amulets became very popular. The tetragram appeared on them, in the form of J, JJ, JJJ, JJJJ or JH, JHW, as the word 'HJH', and in a long series of permutations: ', H, W and J.
</p><p><i>Yawe</i> is found in an Ethiopian Christian list of magical names of Jesus, purporting to have been taught by him to his disciples.

<p>In the Hebrew Bible, the tetragrammaton occurs 6828 times, as can be seen in the <i>Biblia Hebraica</i> and <i>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</i>. In addition, on the margins there are notes (<i>masorah</i>) indicating that in 134 places the soferim (Jewish scribes) altered the original Hebrew text from YHWH to <i>Adonai</i> and 8 places to <i>Elohim</i>, which would add 142 occurrences to the initial number above. According to <i>Brown‚ÄìDriver‚ÄìBriggs</i>, <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô÷∞◊î÷π◊ï÷∏◊î</span>‚Äé (Qr <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ê÷≤◊ì÷π◊†÷∏◊ô</span>‚Äé) occurs 6,518 times, and <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô÷±◊î÷π◊ï÷¥◊î</span>‚Äé (Qr <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù</span>‚Äé) occurs 305 times in the Masoretic Text. It first appears in Hebrew in the Book of Genesis 2:4. The only books it does not appear in are Ecclesiastes, the Book of Esther, and Song of Songs.
</p><p>In the Book of Esther the Tetragrammaton does not appear, but it is present in four complex acrostics in  Hebrew: the initial or last letters of four consecutive words, either forwards or backwards comprise YHWH. These letters were distinguished in at least three ancient Hebrew manuscripts in red. Another acrostic containing the Tetragrammaton also composed the first four words of Psalm 96:11.
</p><p>Short form Jah (digrammaton) "occurs 50 times if the phrase hallellu-Yah is included": 43 times in the Psalms, one in Exodus 15:2; 17:16; Isaiah 12:2; 26:4, and twice in Isaiah 38:11. It also appears in the Greek phrase <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">·ºâŒªŒªŒ∑ŒªŒøœÖœäŒ¨</span> (hallelujah) in <span class="nourlexpansion nowrap">Revelation 19:1‚Äì6</span>.
</p><p>God's name is also found in the Bible as a component in theophoric Hebrew names. Some may have had at the beginning of the form: j√¥- or jeh√¥- (29 names), and the other at the end: jƒÅh√ª- or jƒÅh- (127 names). One name is a form of  jeh√¥ as the second syllable (<i>Elioenaj</i>, hebr. <i> ºelj(eh)o ªenaj</i>). Onomastic Studies indicate that theophoric names containing the Tetragrammaton were very popular during the monarchy (8th‚Äì7th centuries BCE). The popular names with the prefix <i>j√¥-</i>/<i>jeh√¥-</i> diminished, while the suffix <i>jƒÅh√ª-</i>/<i>jƒÅh-</i> increased. The Septuagint typically translates YHWH as <i>kyrios</i> "Lord".
</p><p>Below are the number of occurrences of the Tetragrammaton in various books in the Masoretic Text (6828 in all).

<p>In the Dead Sea Scrolls and other Hebrew and Aramaic texts the tetragrammaton and some other names of God in Judaism (such as El or Elohim) were sometimes written in paleo-Hebrew script, showing that they were treated specially. Most of God's names were pronounced until about the 2nd century BCE. Then, as a tradition of non-pronunciation of the names developed, alternatives for the tetragrammaton appeared, such as Adonai, Kurios and Theos. The 4Q120, a Greek fragment of Leviticus (26:2‚Äì16) discovered in the Dead Sea scrolls (Qumran) has ŒπŒ±œâ ("Iao"), the Greek form of the Hebrew trigrammaton YHW. The historian John the Lydian (6th century) wrote: "The Roman Varo [116‚Äì27¬†BCE] defining him [that is the Jewish God] says that he is called Iao in the Chaldean mysteries" (De Mensibus IV 53). Van Cooten mentions that Iao is one of the "specifically Jewish designations for God" and "the Aramaic papyri from the Jews at Elephantine show that 'Iao' is an original Jewish term".
</p><p>The preserved manuscripts from Qumran show the inconsistent practice of writing the tetragrammaton, mainly in biblical quotations: in some manuscripts is written in paleo-Hebrew script, square scripts or replaced with four dots or dashes (<i>tetrapuncta</i>).
</p><p>The members of the Qumran community were aware of the existence of the tetragrammaton, but this was not tantamount to granting consent for its existing use and speaking. This is evidenced not only by special treatment of the tetragrammaton in the text, but by the recommendation recorded in the 'Rule of Association' (VI, 27): "Who will remember the most glorious name, which is above all [...]".
</p><p>The table below presents all the manuscripts in which the tetragrammaton is written in paleo-Hebrew script, in square scripts, and all the manuscripts in which the copyists have used tetrapuncta.
</p><p>Copyists used the 'tetrapuncta' apparently to warn against pronouncing the name of God. In the manuscript number 4Q248 is in the form of bars.

<p>The most complete copies of the Septuagint (B, <big>◊ê</big>, A), versions from fourth century onwards consistently use <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ</span> ("Lord"), or <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ŒòŒµœåœÇ</span> ("God"), where the Hebrew has YHWH, corresponding to substituting Adonai for YHWH in reading the original, but the oldest fragments have the tetragrammaton in Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew characters, with the exception of P. Ryl. 458 (perhaps the oldest extant Septuagint manuscript) where there are blank spaces, leading some scholars such as Colin Henderson Roberts to believe that it contained letters, and 4Q120 that has ŒôŒëŒ©. According to Paul E. Kahle, in P. Ryl. 458 the tetragrammaton must have been written where these breaks or blank spaces appear. Albert Pietersma claims that P. Ryl. 458 is irrelevant in this discussion: Kahle insisted that a lacuna in it too large for the usual abbreviation <span style="text-decoration:overline;">Œ∫œÇ</span>, which C.H. Roberts suggested was intended for the complete word Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ, was instead meant for the Hebrew tetragrammaton; Pietersma holds that "the full Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ would seem to be perfectly acceptable from every perspective".
</p><p>The oldest known LXX manuscript that has the Hebrew tetragrammaton is of the first century BCE, with the letters written in square script. A slightly later one (between 50 BCE and 50 CE) has the tetragrammon in archaic Paleo-Hebrew letters.
</p><p>Of the same period as the oldest LXX manuscript with the Hebrew tetragrammaton is the manuscript 4Q120 with the Greek trigrammaton ŒôŒëŒ©. P.W. Skehan and Martin Hengel propose that the Septuagint originally had ŒôŒëŒ© (pronounced Yaho = Aramaic ◊ô◊î◊ï) and that this was altered to Aramaic/Hebrew characters and later to Paleo-Hebrew and finally was replaced by ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ.
</p><p>Before the third century CE no Greek manuscript has ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ in place of the tetragram or ŒôŒëŒ©. "An original tetragram, either in Semitic guise or in Greek transliteration", "had been maintained as far back as Origen", who wrote that the best copies used the paleo-Hebrew letters, not the square:

</p></blockquote>
<p>Other old fragments cannot be used in this discussion because, in addition to their brevity and fragmentary condition, they include no Hebrew Bible verse containing the Tetragrammaton (i.e. 4Q119, 4Q121, 4Q122, 7Q5). 4Q126, which contains the word Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ cannot be cited as using it for the tetragrammaton, since its unidentified text is not necessarily biblical.  In Septuagint manuscripts dating from about the third century CE onwards (e.g., P.Oxy656, P.Oxy1075 and P.Oxy1166) the Greek word ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ (Lord) is used rather frequently to represent the divine name ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (YHWH) and can be what was used when reading out representations in non-Greek characters.
</p><p>In 2014, Pavlos Vasileiadis, Doctor of Theology (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), a researcher into the representation of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton in the Greek of various periods down to its modern form, summed up as follows the various views on the original treatment of the tetragrammaton in the Septuagint and concluded that hard evidence supports the view that the Septuagint originally translated the Hebrew tetragrammaton by some form of ŒôŒ±œâ, not by ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ nor by transcribing the tetragrammaton itself:
</p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886047036" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>The original Greek translation of the divine name has proved to be a heavily debated subject. A constantly great amount of scholarly effort has been put in this question, especially as a result of more recent discoveries that challenged previously long-held assumptions. More specifically, W. G. von Baudissin (1929) maintained that right from its origins the LXX had rendered the Tetragrammaton by Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ, and that in no case was this latter a mere substitute for an earlier Œ±Œ¥œâŒΩŒ±Œπ. Based on more recent evidence that had became available, P. Kahle (1960) supported that the Tetragrammaton written with Hebrew or Greek letters was retained in the OG and it was the Christians who later replaced it with Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ. S. Jellicoe (1968) concurred with Kahle. H. Stegemann (1969/1978) argued that ŒôŒ±œâ /i.a.o/ was used in the original LXX. G. Howard (1977/1992) suggested that Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ was not used in the pre-Christian OG. P. W. Skehan (1980) proposed that there had been a textual development concerning the divine name in this order: ŒôŒ±œâ, the Tetragrammaton in square Hebrew characters, the Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew characters and, finally, Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ. M. Hengel  (1989) offered a similar scheme for the use of Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ for the divine name in the LXX tradition. Evolving R. Hanhart‚Äôs position (1978/1986/1999), A. Pietersma (1984) regarded Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ as the original Greek rendering of the Tetragrammaton in the OG text. This view was supported later by J. W. Wevers (2005) and M. R√∂sel (2007). Moreover, R√∂sel argued against the ŒôŒ±œâ being the original LXX rendering of the Tetragrammaton. E. Tov (1998/2004/2008), J. Joosten (2011), and A. Meyer (2014) concluded that Pietersma‚Äôs arguments are unconvincing. More particularly, Tov has supported that the original translators used a pronounceable form of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (like ŒôŒ±œâ), which was later replaced by Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ, while Greek recensions replaced it with transliterations in paleo-Hebrew or square Hebrew characters. R. Furuli (2011), after comparing the various proposals, argued that Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ did not replace the Tetragrammaton before the Common Era and the LXX autographs included the Tetragrammaton in some form of ŒôŒ±œâ. Truly, the hard evidence available supports this latter thesis.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Throughout the Septuagint, as now known, the word ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ (<i>Kyrios</i>) without the definite article is used to represent the divine name, but it is uncertain whether this was the Septuagint's original rendering. Origen (<i>Commentary on Psalms</i> 2.2) and Jerome (<i>Prologus Galeatus</i>) said that in their time the best manuscripts gave not the word ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ but the tetragrammaton itself written in an older form of the Hebrew characters. No Jewish manuscript of the Septuagint has been found with ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ representing the tetragrammaton, and it has been argued, but not widely accepted, that the use of <i>ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ</i> shows that later copies of the Septuagint were of Christian character, and even that the composition of the New Testament preceded the change to <i>ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ</i> in the Septuagint. Its consistent use of <i>ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ</i> to represent the tetragrammaton has been called "a distinguishing mark for any Christian LXX manuscript", However, a passage in the Hebrew Tosefta, Shabbat 13:5 (written c. 300¬†CE), quoting Tarfon (who lived between 70 and 135 CE), says that it was permitted on the Sabbath to burn Christian works ‚àí <i>gilyonim</i> (gospels?) and other writings ‚àí even if they contained the names of God written in them (without specifying the form or forms in which the names of God were written ‚àí as the Aramaic or Paleo-Hebrew Tetragrammaton, as ŒôŒëŒ© or otherwise).
</p><p>In the same year as the summary by Vasileiadis of older interpretations (2014), Frank Shaw published his <i>The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of ŒôŒ±œâ</i>, in which he argues that the divine name was still articulated until the second or third century and that the use of ŒôŒ±œâ was by no means limited to magical or mystical formulas, but was still normal in more elevated contexts such as that exemplified by Papyrus 4Q120. Shaw describes as "inconsistent and contradictory" the arguments by Pietersma, R√∂sel and Perkins for the originality of Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ and considers all theories that posit in the Septuagint a single original form of the divine name as merely based on <i>a priori</i> assumptions. Accordingly, he declares: "The matter of any (especially single) 'original' form of the divine name in the LXX is too complex, the evidence is too scattered and indefinite, and the various approaches offered for the issue are too simplistic" to account for the actual scribal practices (p. 158). He holds that the earliest stages of the LXX's translation were marked by diversity (p. 262), with the choice of certain divine names depending on the context in which they appear (cf. Gen 4:26; Exod 3:15; 8:22; 28:32; 32:5; and 33:19). He treats of the related blank spaces in Septuagint manuscripts and the setting of spaces around the divine name in 4Q120 and another manuscript (p. 265), and repeats that "there was no one 'original' form but different translators had different feelings, theological beliefs, motivations, and practices when it came to their handling of the name" (p. 271).
</p><p>His view on these points has won the support of Didier Fontaine, Anthony R. Meyer, Bob Becking, and earlier (commenting on Shaw's 2011 dissertation on the subject) D.T. Runia.
</p><p>In the list of 120 or so manuscripts and fragments of Old Greek translations (LXX, Aquila etc.) down to and including the complete texts, Robert A. Kraft indicates that one has spaces in place of the Tetragrammaton (P. Ryl. 458) and one has ŒôŒëŒ© (4Q120) in the period before the turn of the era. Extant manuscripts containing Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ, including the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus codices, are from the third century CE onwards.

<p>Sidney Jellicoe concluded that "Kahle is right in holding that LXX [Septuagint] texts, written by Jews for Jews, retained the divine name in Hebrew Letters (paleo-Hebrew or Aramaic) or in the Greek-letters imitative form <i>Œ†ŒôŒ†Œô</i>, and that its replacement by <i>ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ</i> was a Christian innovation". Jellicoe draws together evidence from a great many scholars (B. J. Roberts, Baudissin, Kahle and C. H. Roberts) and various segments of the Septuagint to draw the conclusions that the absence of "Adonai" from the text suggests that the insertion of the term <i>Kyrios</i> was a later practice; in the Septuagint <i>Kyrios</i> is used to substitute YHWH; and the tetragrammaton appeared in the original text, but Christian copyists removed it.
</p><p>Eusebius and Jerome (translator of the <i>Vulgate</i>) used the Hexapla. <span class="citation-needed-content" style="padding-left:0.1em; padding-right:0.1em; color:#595959; border:1px solid #DDD;">Both attest to the importance of the sacred Name and that some manuscripts of Septuagint contained the tetragrammaton in Hebrew letters.</span> This is further affirmed by The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology, which states "Recently discovered texts doubt the idea that the translators of the LXX (Septuagint) have rendered the tetragrammaton JHWH with KYRIOS. The most ancient available manuscripts of the LXX have the tetragrammaton written in Hebrew letters in the Greek text. This was a custom preserved by the later Hebrew translator of the Old Testament in the first centuries (after Christ)"
</p><p>David Trobisch has noted that, while Christian manuscripts of the Jewish Bible use KœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ or the <i>nomina sacra</i> <span style="text-decoration:overline;">ŒòœÇ</span> and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">Œ∫œÇ</span> (with a horizontal line above the contracted words) to represent the Tetragrammaton, manuscripts of Greek translations of the Old Testament written by Jewish scribes, such as those found in Qumran, reproduce it within the Greek text in several different ways. Some give it in either Hebrew, Aramaic or paleo-Hebrew letters. Others transliterate it in Greek characters as Œ†ŒôŒ†Œô or ŒôŒëŒ©. The fragment Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1007 is in fact difficult to identify as either Christian or Jewish, as on the barely legible recto side (in Gen 2:18) it contains the nomen sacrum <span style="text-decoration:overline;">ŒòŒ£</span> (characteristic of Christian manuscripts) and the Tetragrammaton represented as a double yodh ◊ô◊ô (characteristic of Jewish manuscripts).
</p><p>According to Edmon Gallagher, a faculty member of Heritage Christian University, "extant Greek manuscripts from Qumran and elsewhere that are unambiguously Jewish (because of the date) also include several ways of representing the Divine Name, none of which was with Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ, the term used everywhere in our Christian manuscripts". He concludes that there is no certainty about whether it was a Jew or a Christian who transcribed the Cairo Genizah  manuscripts of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible by Aquila (not the LXX), in which the Tetragrammaton is generally given in paleo-Hebrew letters but in one instance, where there was insufficient space at the end of a line, by <span style="text-decoration:overline;">Œ∫œÖ</span>, the <i>nomen sacrum</i> rendering of the genitive case of ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ. E. Gallagher also "has argued convincingly that Christian scribes might have produced paleo-Hebrew Tetragrammata within their biblical manuscripts, in addition to the attested use of the forms ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î and œÄŒπœÄŒπ."

<p>The Peshitta (Syriac translation), probably in the second century, uses the word "Lord" (<span dir="rtl" lang="syr" title="Syriac language text">‹°‹≥‹™‹ù‹≥‹ê</span>, pronounced <i>moryo</i>) for the Tetragrammaton.

<p>The Vulgate (Latin translation) made from the Hebrew in the 4th century CE, uses the word <i lang="la">Dominus</i> ("Lord"), a translation of the Hebrew word <i>Adonai</i>, for the tetragrammaton.
</p><p>The Vulgate translation, though made not from the Septuagint but from the Hebrew text, did not depart from the practice used in the Septuagint. Thus, for most of its history, Christianity's translations of the Scriptures have used equivalents of <i>Adonai</i> to represent the tetragrammaton. Only at about the beginning of the 16th century did Christian translations of the Bible appear with transliterations of the tetragrammaton.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Genizah</div>
<p>Especially due to the existence of the Mesha Stele, the Jahwist tradition found in Exod. 3:15, and ancient Hebrew and Greek texts, biblical scholars widely hold that the tetragrammaton and other names of God were spoken by the ancient Israelites and their neighbours.
</p><p>Some time after the destruction of Solomon's Temple, the spoken use of God's name as it was written ceased among the people, even though knowledge of the pronunciation was perpetuated in rabbinic schools. The Talmud relays this occurred after the death of Simeon the Just (either Simon I or his great-great-grandson Simon II). Philo calls it ineffable, and says that it is lawful for those only whose ears and tongues are purified by wisdom to hear and utter it in a holy place (that is, for priests in the Temple). In another passage, commenting on Lev. xxiv. 15 seq.: "If any one, I do not say should blaspheme against the Lord of men and gods, but should even dare to utter his name unseasonably, let him expect the penalty of death."
</p><p>Rabbinic sources suggest that the name of God was pronounced only once a year, by the high priest, on the Day of Atonement. Others, including Maimonides, claim that the name was pronounced daily in the liturgy of the Temple in the priestly benediction of worshippers (Num. vi. 27), after the daily sacrifice; in the synagogues, though, a substitute (probably "Adonai") was used. According to the Talmud, in the last generations before the fall of Jerusalem, the name was pronounced in a low tone so that the sounds were lost in the chant of the priests. Since the destruction of Second Temple of Jerusalem in 70¬†CE, the tetragrammaton has no longer been pronounced in the liturgy. However the pronunciation was still known in Babylonia in the latter part of the 4th century.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Spoken_prohibitions">Spoken prohibitions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The vehemence with which the utterance of the name is denounced in the Mishnah suggests that use of Yahweh was unacceptable in rabbinical Judaism. "He who pronounces the Name with its own letters has no part in the world to come!" Such is the prohibition of pronouncing the Name as written that it is sometimes called the "Ineffable", "Unutterable", or "Distinctive Name".
</p><p>Halakha prescribes that whereas the Name written "yodh he waw he", it is only to be pronounced "Adonai"; and the latter name too is regarded as a holy name, and is only to be pronounced in prayer. Thus when someone wants to refer in third person to either the written or spoken Name, the term <i>HaShem</i> "the Name" is used; and this handle itself can also be used in prayer. The Masoretes added vowel points (niqqud) and cantillation marks to the manuscripts to indicate vowel usage and for use in ritual chanting of readings from the Bible in Jewish prayer in synagogues. To <span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊ô◊î◊ï◊î</span>‚Äé they added the vowels for "<i lang="he-Latn" title="Hebrew language text">Adonai</i>" ("My Lord"), the word to use when the text was read. While "HaShem" is the most common way to reference "the Name", the terms "HaMaqom" (lit. "The Place", i.e. "The Omnipresent") and "Ra·∏•mana" (Aramaic, "Merciful") are used in the mishna and gemara, still used in the phrases "HaMaqom y'na·∏•em eth·∏•em" ("may The Omnipresent console you"), the traditional phrase used in sitting Shiva and "Ra·∏•mana l'tzlan" ("may the Merciful save us" i.e. "God forbid").

<p>The written tetragrammaton, as well as six other names of God, must be treated with special sanctity. They cannot be disposed of regularly, lest they be desecrated, but are usually put in long term storage or buried in Jewish cemeteries in order to retire them from use. Similarly, writing the tetragrammaton (or these other names) unnecessarily is prohibited, so as to avoid having them treated disrespectfully, an action that is forbidden. To guard the sanctity of the Name, sometimes a letter is substituted by a different letter in writing (e.g. ◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ß), or the letters are separated by one or more hyphens, a practice applied also to the English name "God", which Jews commonly write as "G-d". Most Jewish authorities say that this practice is not obligatory for the English name.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy</div>
<p>Kabbalistic tradition holds that the correct pronunciation is known to a select few people in each generation, it is not generally known what this pronunciation is. In late kabbalistic works the tetragrammaton is sometimes referred to as the name of <i>Havayah</i>‚Äî<span dir="rtl" lang="he" title="Hebrew language text">◊î◊ï◊ô'◊î</span>, meaning "the Name of Being/Existence". This name also helps when one needs to refer specifically to the written Name; similarly, "Shem Adonoot", meaning "the Name of Lordship" can be used to refer to the spoken name "Adonai" specifically.
</p><p>Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, says that the tree of the tetragrammaton "unfolds" in accordance with the intrinsic nature of its letters, "in the same order in which they appear in the Name, in the mystery of ten and the mystery of four." Namely, the upper cusp of the <i>Yod</i> is Arich Anpin and the main body of <i>Yod</i> is and Abba; the first <i>Hei</i> is Imma; the <i>Vav</i> is Ze`ir Anpin and the second <i>Hei</i> is Nukvah. It unfolds in this aforementioned order and "in the mystery of the four expansions" that are constituted by the following various spellings of the letters:
</p><p><b>◊¢"◊ë/<i>`AV</i></b>¬†: ◊ô◊ï"◊ì ◊î"◊ô ◊ï◊ô"◊ï ◊î"◊ô, so called "`AV"  according to its gematria value ◊¢"◊ë=70+2=72.
</p><p><b>◊°"◊í/<i>SaG</i></b>:  ◊ô◊ï"◊ì ◊î"◊ô ◊ï◊ê"◊ï ◊î"◊ô,  gematria 63.
</p><p><b>◊û"◊î/<i>MaH</i></b>: ◊ô◊ï"◊ì ◊î"◊ê ◊ï◊ê"◊ï ◊î"◊ê, gematria 45.
</p><p><b>◊ë"◊ü/<i>BaN</i></b>:  ◊ô◊ï"◊ì ◊î"◊î ◊ï"◊ï ◊î"◊î, gematria 52.
</p><p>Luzzatto summarises, "In sum, all that exists is founded on the mystery of this Name and upon the mystery of these letters of which it consists. This means that all the different orders and laws are all drawn after and come under the order of these four letters. This is not one particular pathway but rather the general path, which includes everything that exists in the Sefirot in all their details and which brings everything under its order."

<p>There are some who believe that the tetractys and its mysteries influenced the early kabbalists. A Hebrew tetractys in a similar way has the letters of the tetragrammaton (the four lettered name of God in Hebrew scripture) inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occult writer Dion Fortune says: 
</p>
<dl><dd>"The point is assigned to Kether;</dd>
<dd>the line to Chokmah;</dd>
<dd>the two-dimensional plane to Binah;</dd>
<dd>consequently the three-dimensional solid naturally falls to Chesed."</dd></dl>
<p>(The first three-dimensional solid is the tetrahedron.)
</p><p>The relationship between geometrical shapes and the first four Sephirot is analogous to the geometrical correlations in tetractys, shown above under <span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;">Pythagorean Symbol</span>, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the tetractys.

<p>The Samaritans shared the taboo of the Jews about the utterance of the name, and there is no evidence that its pronunciation was common Samaritan practice. However Sanhedrin 10:1 includes the comment of Rabbi Mana II, "for example those Kutim who take an oath" would also have no share in the world to come, which suggests that Mana thought some Samaritans used the name in making oaths. (Their priests have preserved a liturgical pronunciation "Yahwe" or "Yahwa" to the present day.) As with Jews, the use of <i>Shema</i> (◊©◊û◊ê "the Name") remains the everyday usage of the name among Samaritans, akin to Hebrew "the Name" (Hebrew ◊î◊©◊ù  "HaShem").

<p>It is assumed that early Jewish Christians inherited from Jews the practice of reading "Lord" where the tetragrammaton appeared in the Hebrew text, or where a tetragrammaton may have been marked in a Greek text. Gentile Christians, primarily non-Hebrew speaking and using Greek texts, may have read "Lord" as it occurred in the Greek text of the New Testament and their copies of the Greek Old Testament. This practice continued into the Latin Vulgate where "Lord" represented the tetragrammaton in the Latin text.  In Petrus Alphonsi's Tetragrammaton-Trinity diagram, the name is written as "Ieve".  At the Reformation, the Luther Bible used "Jehova" in the German text of Luther's Old Testament.

<p>As mentioned above, the Septuagint (Greek translation), the Vulgate (Latin translation), and the Peshitta (Syriac translation) use the word "Lord" (<span lang="el" title="Greek language text">Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ</span>, <i>kyrios</i>, <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">dominus</i>, and <span dir="rtl" lang="syr" title="Syriac language text">‹°‹≥‹™‹ù‹≥‹ê</span>, <i>moryo</i> respectively).
</p><p>Use of the Septuagint by Christians in polemics with Jews led to its abandonment by the latter, making it a specifically Christian text. From it Christians made translations into Coptic, Arabic, Slavonic and other languages used in Oriental Orthodoxy and the Eastern Orthodox Church, whose liturgies and doctrinal declarations are largely a cento of texts from the Septuagint, which they consider to be inspired at least as much as the Masoretic Text. Within the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Greek text remains the norm for texts in all languages, with particular reference to the wording used in prayers.
</p><p>The Septuagint, with its use of ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ to represent the tetragrammaton, was the basis also for Christian translations associated with the West, in particular the Vetus Itala, which survives in some parts of the liturgy of the Latin Church, and the Gothic Bible.
</p><p>Christian translations of the Bible into English commonly use "L<span class="smallcaps" style="font-size:83%">ORD</span>" in place of the tetragrammaton in most passages, often in small capitals (or in all caps), so as to distinguish it from other words translated as "Lord".

<li>The New English Bible (NT 1961, OT 1970) generally uses the word "L<span class="smallcaps" style="font-size:83%">ORD</span>" but uses "J<span style="font-size:85%;">EHOVAH</span>" several times. For examples of both forms, see Exodus Chapter 3 and footnote to verse 15.</li>
<li>The New International Version (1973/1978/1983/2011) generally uses "the L<span style="font-size:85%;">ORD</span>," though in Exodus 3:14, the tetragrammaton is thrice translated "I A<span style="font-size:85%;">M</span>."

<p>In the Catholic Church, the first edition of the official Vatican <i>Nova Vulgata Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio, editio typica</i>, published in 1979, used the traditional <i>Dominus</i> when rendering the tetragrammaton in the overwhelming majority of places where it appears; however, it also used the form <i>Iahveh</i> for rendering the tetragrammaton in three known places:
</p>
<ul><li>Exodus 3:15</li>
<li>Exodus 15:3</li>
<li>Exodus 17:15</li></ul>
<p>In the second edition of the <i>Nova Vulgata Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio, editio typica altera</i>, published in 1986, these few occurrences of the form <i>Iahveh</i> were replaced with <i>Dominus</i>, in keeping with the long-standing Catholic tradition of avoiding direct usage of the Ineffable Name.
</p><p>On 29 June 2008, the Holy See reacted to the then still recent practice of pronouncing, within Catholic liturgy, the name of God represented by the tetragrammaton. As examples of such vocalisation it mentioned "Yahweh" and "Yehovah". The early Christians, it said, followed the example of the Septuagint in replacing the name of God with "the Lord", a practice with important theological implications for their use of "the Lord" in reference to Jesus, as in Philippians 2:9-11 and other New Testament texts. It therefore directed that, "in liturgical celebrations, in songs and prayers the name of God in the form of the <i>tetragrammaton</i> YHWH is neither to be used or pronounced"; and that translations of Biblical texts for liturgical use are to follow the practice of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, replacing the divine name with "the Lord" or, in some contexts, "God". The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops welcomed this instruction, adding that it "provides also an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the Name of God in daily life, emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship".
