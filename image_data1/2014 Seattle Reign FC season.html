<p>Following an inaugural 2013 season that saw the team finish 7th out of 8 teams, the roster was significantly overhauled by Head Coach and GM Laura Harvey, with only 9 players returning for the 2014 season. In November, the team acquired US National team forward Sydney Leroux in a trade with the Boston Breakers.  Two days later, they
signed Scottish international Kim Little — who had previously played for Harvey at Arsenal — after acquiring her NWSL rights in a trade with the Washington Spirit.
</p><p>In the January 2014 NWSL College Draft, the team selected Amanda Frisbie of Portland (1st round),  Megan Brigman of North Carolina (2nd round), and Ellen Parker of Portland (4th round).  In February, they announced that they would be moving home stadiums from Starfire Sports in Tukwila to Memorial Stadium, located near downtown Seattle in Seattle Center.  On February 10 they announced the signing of their third international player, adding Japanese national team midfielder Nahomi Kawasumi on loan from Japanese club side INAC Kobe Leonessa.
