<td>Lieutenant Inspector Pierre-Luc Goddard was the senior officer on the scene investigating the shooting retired librarian Christopher Enos by a rooftop sniper. Goddard had Gordon Kirby arrested when he came forward with information regarding the attack. Gordie’s intel eventually led to the arrest of a home-grown terrorist with ties to a larger organization. The opportunistic Goddard took credit for the arrest. Rene Marble, head of Internal Affairs at the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal, has a large file on Goddard and describes him as “poorly drawn”. Gordie reported smelling alcohol on Goddard’s breath as he was being questioned.

It was meant as a joke; a reference to his early superhero comic habit and devotion to the original Batman television series, for which she teased him endlessly. Joke or not, Gordie started wearing it. It was a private thing that never ceased to amuse him. He’d put it on and go up to the roof of his apartment building and goof around. After Gordie came across Harvey and became his guardian (and vice versa), he started wearing the costume on their frequent walks. When they would go out together for their nightly walks, stage and interesting things would happen. Whenever he wore the costume, the universe seemed to go out of its way to dish out something weird. In his costumed identity of the Jammer, Gordie was involved in international assassination plots, had an interview with a crazy psychiatrist when <i>he</i> was the one who got paid, spoke with the ghost of M.C. Escher, and met others who actually possess what could technically be called “superpowers”.

Collin eventually proposed to Janet right before she left for her teaching position in the north. She promptly shut him down. When Janet stopped returning his calls, Collin assumed that Gordie was holding her hostage. He arrived at their apartment and attacked Gordie. When the police arrived at the scene, Gordie had Collin incapacitated and was sitting on top of him. Gordie was tased before he could explain what happened. It was subsequently discovered that Collin had a long history of mental instability. At the time he reconnected with Janet, he was off his meds. After he was arrested, Collin was placed back on his regular medication. Collin’s well-connected family bribed Gordie with money to keep quiet about their son’s misadventures.

<td>Klee Shonin was a gallery artist whose body of work consisted of photographs of sad people and dead bodies. Gordon Kirby felt Shonin’s art was bullshit, consisting of just a bunch of negative imagery slapped together to elicit a reaction. At least one of his tragic photographs was staged. Shonin sent Gordon and Janet’s friend Megan a telegram informing her of her mother’s death. Shonin was on hand to photograph her devastation. Janet spotted the image when they attended Shonin’s gallery opening. When Megan realized that the telegram was a cruel joke staged by the artist, she marched right up to Shonin and kicked him in the groin. Hard. In an ironic twist, Shonin’s own suffering was captured by a fellow photographer attending the show.

Flarks consider it a great honor to die in service to their cause. They are led by the king’s brother, Rasha. According to the Blood King, the Flarks used to be harmless. That changed when they found a financier who provided them with bizarre weaponry. A Flark is identified by his opaque goggles and an “x” tattooed somewhere on his face. The Flarks have two standards: one features a bull; the other, a lion. During their time in Montréal, upwards of 100 Flarks were headquartered on the cargo-ship <i>Sea Hag</i>. Zorba Pizzaria reported that they were horrible tippers.
