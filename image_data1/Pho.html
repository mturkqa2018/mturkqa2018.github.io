Pho is a popular street food in Vietnam and a specialty in a number of restaurant chains around the world.  Pho originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the rest of the world by refugees after the Vietnam War. Because pho's origins are poorly documented, there is significant disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the word itself. The Hanoi and Saigon styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs.

<p>Pho likely evolved from similar dishes; for example, villagers in <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Vân Cù</i> say they ate pho long before the French colonial period. The modern form of the dish emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern Vietnam, southeast of Hanoi in Nam Định Province, then a substantial textile market. The traditional home of pho is reputed to be the villages of <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Vân Cù</i> and <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Dao Cù</i> (or <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Giao Cù</i>) in Đông Xuân commune, Nam Trực District, Nam Định Province.
</p><p>Cultural historian and researcher Trịnh Quang Dũng believes that the popularization and origins of the modern pho stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century. These include the higher availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were purchased by Chinese workers to make into a dish similar to pho called <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">ngưu nhục phấn</i>. The demand for this dish was initially the greatest with workers sourced from the provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong, who found affinity to the dish due to its similarities to that of their homeland, which eventually popularized and familiarized this dish with the general population.
</p><p>Pho was originally sold at dawn and dusk by roaming street vendors, who shouldered mobile kitchens on carrying poles (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gánh phở</i>). From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of pho. The heavy <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gánh</i> was always shouldered by men. They kept their heads warm with distinctive, disheveled felt hats called <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">mũ phở</i>.
</p><p>Hanoi's first two fixed pho stands were a Vietnamese-owned Cát Tường on Cầu Gỗ Street and a Chinese-owned stand in front of Bờ Hồ tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Quạt Row and Đồng Row. Around 1925, a Vân Cù villager named Vạn opened the first "Nam Định style" pho stand in Hanoi. <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Gánh phở</i> declined in number around 1936–1946 in favor of stationary eateries.

<p>In the late 1920s, various vendors experimented with <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">húng lìu</i>, sesame oil, tofu, and even <i>Lethocerus indicus</i> extract (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">cà cuống</i>). This "<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở cải lương</i>" failed to enter the mainstream.
</p><p><i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Phở tái</i>, served with rare beef, had been introduced by 1930. Chicken pho appeared in 1939, possibly because beef was not sold at the markets on Mondays and Fridays at the time.

<p>With the partition of Vietnam in 1954, over a million people fled North Vietnam for South Vietnam. Pho, previously unpopular in the South, suddenly took off. No longer confined to northern culinary traditions, variations in meat and broth appeared, and additional garnishes, such as lime, Mung bean sprouts (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Giá đỗ</i>), culantro (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">ngò gai</i>), cinnamon basil (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">húng quế</i>), Hoisin sauce (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">tương đen</i>), and hot chili sauce (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">tương ớt</i>) became standard fare. <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Phở tái</i> also began to rival fully cooked <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở chín</i> in popularity. Migrants from the North similarly popularized <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">bánh mì</i> sandwiches.
</p><p>Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, private pho restaurants were nationalized (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">mậu dịch quốc doanh</i>) and began serving pho noodles made from old rice. Street vendors were forced to use noodles made of imported potato flour. Officially banned as capitalism, these vendors prized portability, carrying their wares on <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gánh</i> and setting out plastic stools for customers.

<p>During the so-called "subsidy period" following the Vietnam War, state-owned pho eateries served a meatless variety of the dish known as "pilotless pho" (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở không người lái</i>), in reference to the U.S. Air Force's unmanned reconnaissance drones. The broth consisted of boiled water with MSG added for taste, as there were often shortages on various foodstuffs like meat and rice during that period. Bread or cold rice was often served as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">quẩy</i> in pho.
</p><p>Pho eateries were privatized as part of Đổi Mới. However, many street vendors must still maintain a light footprint to evade police enforcing the street tidiness rules that replaced the ban on private ownership.

<p>In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese refugees brought pho to many countries. Restaurants specializing in pho appeared in numerous Asian enclaves and Little Saigons, such as in Paris and in major cities in the United States, Canada and Australia. In 1980, the first of hundreds of pho restaurants opened in the Little Saigon in Orange County, California.
</p><p>In the United States, pho began to enter the mainstream during the 1990s, as relations between the U.S. and Vietnam improved. At that time Vietnamese restaurants began opening quickly in Texas and California, spreading rapidly along the Gulf and West Coasts, as well as the East Coast and the rest of the country. During the 2000s, pho restaurants in the United States generated US$500 million in annual revenue, according to an unofficial estimate. Pho can now be found in cafeterias at many college and corporate campuses, especially on the West Coast.
</p><p>The word "pho" was added to the <i>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i> in 2007. Pho is listed at number 28 on "World's 50 most delicious foods" compiled by <i>CNN Go</i> in 2011. The Vietnamese Embassy in Mexico celebrated Pho Day on April 3, 2016, with Osaka Prefecture holding a similar commemoration the following day. Pho has been adopted by other Southeast Asian cuisines, including Hmong cuisine. It sometimes appears as "Phô" on menus in Australia.

<p>Reviews of 19th and 20th century Indochinese literature have found that pho entered the mainstream sometime in the 1910s. Phạm Đình Hổ's 1827 Hán-Nôm dictionary <i>Nhật dụng thường đàm</i> includes an entry for rice noodles (traditional Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant" title="Chinese language text">玉酥餅</span>; ; Vietnamese: <i lang="vi">ngọc tô bính</i>) with the definition 羅𩛄普𤙭 (Vietnamese: <i lang="vi">là bánh phở bò</i>; "is beef pho noodle"), borrowing a character ordinarily pronounced "phổ" or "phơ" to refer to pho. Georges Dumoutier's extensive 1907 account of Vietnamese cuisine omits any mention of pho, while Nguyễn Công Hoan recalls its sale by street vendors in 1913. A 1931 dictionary is the first to define <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở</i> as a soup: "from the word <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phấn</i>. A dish consisting of small slices of rice cake boiled with beef."
</p><p>Possibly the earliest English-language reference to pho was in the book <i>Recipes of All Nations</i>, edited by Countess Morphy in 1935: In the book, pho is described as "an Annamese soup held in high esteem ... made with beef, a veal bone, onions, a bayleaf, salt, and pepper, and a small teaspoon of <i>nuoc-mam</i><i>."</i>
</p><p>There are two prevailing theories on the origin of the word <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở</i> and, by extension, the dish itself. As author Nguyễn Dư notes, both questions are significant to Vietnamese identity.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_French">From French</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>French settlers commonly ate beef, whereas Vietnamese traditionally ate pork and chicken and used cattle as beasts of burden. Gustave Hue (1937) equates <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">cháo phở</i> to the French beef stew <i lang="fr" title="French language text">pot-au-feu</i> (literally, "pot on the fire"). Accordingly, Western sources generally maintain that <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở</i> is derived from <i lang="fr" title="French language text">pot-au-feu</i> in both name and substance. However, several scholars dispute this etymology on the basis of the stark differences between the two dishes. Ironically, pho in French has long been pronounced <small></small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[fo]</span> rather than <small></small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[fø]</span>: in Jean Tardieu's <i>Lettre de Hanoï à Roger Martin Du Gard</i> (1928), a soup vendor cries "Pho-ô!" in the street.
</p><p>Many Hanoians explain that the word <i lang="fr" title="French language text">phở</i> derives from French soldiers' ordering "<i lang="fr" title="French language text">feu</i>" (fire) from <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gánh phở</i>, referring to both the steam rising from a bowl of pho and the wood fire seen glowing from a <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gánh phở</i> in the evening.
</p><p>Food historian Erica J. Peters argues that the French have embraced pho in a way that overlooks its origins as a local improvisation, reinforcing "an idea that the French brought modern ingenuity to a traditionalist Vietnam".
</p><p>It is also sometimes assumed that the names of the varieties of pho, specifically <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở bò</i> (beef) and <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở gà</i> (chicken), are also of French or even Latin origin, as Latin <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">bos</i> and <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">gallus</i> mean "cattle" and "chicken", respectively. But this is an apparent coincidence, as <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">bò</i> and <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gà</i> are native Vietnamese words.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_Cantonese">From Cantonese</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Hue and Eugèn Gouin (1957) both define <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở</i> by itself as an abbreviation of <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">lục phở</i>. Elucidating on the 1931 dictionary, Gouin and Lê Ngọc Trụ (1970) both give <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">lục phở</i> as a corruption of <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">ngưu nhục phấn</i> (Chinese: <span lang="zh" title="Chinese language text">牛肉粉</span>; Cantonese Yale: <i>ngau4 yuk6 fan2</i>; "cow meat noodles"), which was commonly sold by Chinese immigrants in Hanoi. (<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɲ]</span> is an allophone of <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/l/</span> in some northern dialects of Vietnamese.)
</p><p>Some scholars argue that pho (the dish) evolved from <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">xáo trâu</i>, a Vietnamese dish common in Hanoi at the turn of the century. Originally eaten by commoners near the Red River, it consisted of stir-fried strips of water buffalo meat served in broth atop rice vermicelli. Around 1908–1909, the shipping industry brought an influx of laborers. Vietnamese and Chinese cooks set up <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">gánh</i> to serve them <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">xáo trâu</i> but later switched to inexpensive scraps of beef set aside by butchers who sold to the French. Chinese vendors advertised this <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">xáo bò</i> by crying out, "Beef and noodles!" (Cantonese Yale: <i>ngàuh yuhk fán</i>; Vietnamese: <i lang="vi">ngưu nhục phấn</i>). Eventually the street cry became "Meat and noodles!" (Chinese: <span lang="zh" title="Chinese language text">肉粉</span>; Cantonese Yale: <i>yuhk fán</i>; Vietnamese: <i lang="vi">nhục phấn</i>), with the last syllable elongated. Nguyễn Ngọc Bích suggests that the final "n" was eventually dropped because of the similar-sounding <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phẩn</i> (traditional Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant" title="Chinese language text">糞</span>; simplified Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hans" title="Chinese language text">粪</span>; "excrement"). The French author Jean Marquet refers to the dish as "<i lang="fr" title="French language text">Yoc feu</i>!" in his 1919 novel <i>Du village-à-la cité</i>. This is likely what the Vietnamese poet Tản Đà calls "<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">nhục-phở</i>" in "<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Đánh bạc</i>" ("Gambling"), written around 1915–1917.

<p>Pho is served in a bowl with a specific cut of flat rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket). Variations feature slow-cooked tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using chicken bones and meat, as well as some internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs, and the gizzard.
</p><p>When eating at phở stalls in Vietnam, customers are generally asked which parts of the beef they would like and how they want it done. 
</p><p>Beef parts including:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Tái băm</b>: Chopped beef patty</li>
<li><b>Tái</b>: Rare patty cooked by the hot broth itself</li>
<li><b>Tái sống</b>: Very rare meat</li>
<li><b>Tái chín</b>: Medium to well-done steak</li>

<p>The broth for beef pho is generally made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove.  The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.

The exact amount differs with each bag.</div></div></div>
<p>The spices, often wrapped in cheesecloth or a soaking bag to prevent them from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion.
</p><p>Careful cooks often roast ginger and onion over an open fire for about a minute before adding them to the stock, to bring out their full flavor. They also skim off all the impurities that float to the top while cooking; this is the key to a clear broth. <i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">Nước mắm</i> (fish sauce) is added toward the end.

<p>The several regional variants of pho in Vietnam, particularly divided between "Northern pho" (<b><i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở Bắc</i></b>) and "southern pho" or "Saigon pho" (<b><i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">phở Nam</i></b>). Northern pho by the use of blanched whole green onion, and garnishes offered generally include only diced green onion and cilantro, garlic, chili sauce and quẩy. On the other hand, southern Vietnamese pho broth is less oily and consumed with bean sprouts, fresh sliced chili, hoisin sauce and a greater variety of fresh herbs. Pho may be served with either pho noodles or kuy teav noodles (<i lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">hủ tiếu</i>). The variations in meat, broth, and additional garnishes such as lime, bean sprouts, <i>ngò gai</i> (<i>Eryngium foetidum</i>), <i>húng quế</i> (Thai/Asian basil), and <i>tương đen</i> (bean sauce/hoisin sauce), <i>tương ớt</i> (hot chili sauce, e.g., Sriracha sauce) appear to be innovations made by or introduced to the South. Another style of northern phở is  <b>Phở Nam Định</b> from Nam Định city.
