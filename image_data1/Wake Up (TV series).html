<p>When a patient died from a rare anaesthesia complication (malignant hyperthermia) during a medical operation led by the hospital’s Chief Physician Chen Hsien Rong (Michael Huang), anaesthesiologist Dr. Hsiao Zheng Xun (Jag Huang) was pressured to take the blame and suspended from duty. However, the insurance agent who handled the death claim, Yeh Jian De (Wu Kang-jen), discovered that there was more to the death cause and teamed up with Hsiao to investigate the situation. The medical operation also reunited Hsiao with his former schoolmate, Song Zhao Ying (Hsieh Ying-Shiuan) whom reminded Hsiao of his past trauma. A troubled Hsiao then approaches psychiatrist Yang Wei Yu (Hsu Wei-ning) to help him with psychology treatments. Facing pressure from the corrupted hospital system and his past trauma, would Hsiao fight for his conscience or would he give up and conform?
