<p><b>JKT48</b> (read as "J. K. T. Forty-eight") is an Indonesian idol group whose name is derived from its based city of Jakarta and the Japanese idol group AKB48. Formed in 2011, it is the first AKB48 sister group outside Japan and adopts the concept of "idols you can meet", before switching to "idols that will come to meet you" since 8 April 2018. Fans can attend daily performances at the group's theater, which was built as a close replica to the AKB48 Theater in Akihabara.
</p><p>While JKT48 does not restrict membership by nationality, applicants must be residents of Indonesia. As of 12 April 2019, the group has 44 active team members. It also has 23 Class A Academy members – formerly known as trainees – and no Class B Academy members.
</p><p>On 16 February 2013, JKT48 released its first studio album <i>Heavy Rotation</i> via Hits Records, a division of MNC subsidiary PT Star Media Nusantara. It performs songs by AKB48 and other sister groups that are translated into Indonesian.

<p>Producer Yasushi Akimoto decided to bring the AKB48 concept to Indonesia because the group had begun to develop a fan base in the country. Indonesia's growing economy was seen as a potential market by many Japanese companies, and Akimoto established a franchising partnership with Dentsu Media Group Indonesia to replicate the AKB48 business model. Dentsu Media Group Indonesia then cooperated with the country's largest media conglomerate Global Mediacom (MNC Media) as JKT48 official media partner.
</p><p>Much like AKB48, the female Japanese idol group formed in 2005 in the Akihabara, Tokyo, JKT48 is based on the concept of idols with whom fans can "'meet', or at least develop a similar feeling of intimacy". JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of Jakarta, Indonesia. The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population—As of 2012 about half are under the age of 30—and the popularity of Japanese <i>manga</i> series, such as <i>Slam Dunk</i> and <i>One Piece</i>. In order to bring the concept of AKB48 to Indonesia, producer Yasushi Akimoto and Dentsu Media Group Indonesia partnered with the country's largest media conglomerate, Global Mediacom (MNC Media),and Rakuten.
</p><p>
In an interview on CNN's <i>TalkAsia</i> program, Akimoto responded to the question of why he selected Indonesia as the first target of AKB48's overseas expansion: </p><blockquote><p>"People in Indonesia were interested in AKB48. That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition."</p></blockquote><p> Then Rakuten–MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: </p><blockquote><p>"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia."</p></blockquote>

<p>On 11 September 2011<span class="noprint"> (7 years ago)</span><span style="display:none"> (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2011-09-11</span>)</span>, the formation of JKT48 was announced at an AKB48 event held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. Applicant interviews took place the following weeks, in late September 2011, and the first auditions were held a month after the initial announcement, from 8–9 October 2011. AKB48 member Minami Takahashi also visited Jakarta during the auditions to promote JKT48 among fans of AKB48. Although applicants did not have to be Indonesian citizens, they did have to already reside in the country. Approximately 1,200 girls auditioned for the group, and 51 were selected to proceed to the second round. Finalists were judged based on their dance performance of "Heavy Rotation", from AKB48's single of the same name, and their performance of a song of their choice. JKT48's 28 first generation members, ages 12–21, were selected on 2 November 2011.
</p><p>On 17 December 2011, JKT48 made its first public appearance on the live music program <i>100% Ampuh</i> on Global TV, performing "Heavy Rotation", with lyrics translated into Indonesian.

<p>As part of the concept of "idols you can meet every day", AKB48 performs daily at its theater in Akihabara. The JKT48 management team aimed to accomplish this same principle and began scouting locations in Jakarta for the group's own theater in early 2012. An unoccupied site in the fX Sudirman shopping mall was selected as the theater's eventual location, and planning for its renovation began in April. In the meantime, the first theater performances were held 17–20 May 2012 at a temporary stage in the Nyi Ageng Serang Building in Kuningan, Jakarta. The official theater opened on 8 September 2012 for daily performances with a set list of 16 songs that have been translated into Indonesian. The theater has a seating capacity of 180 and standing room for 30, and its design is a close replica of the AKB48 Theater.
</p><p>JKT48 has also performed in Japan alongside other AKB48 sister groups. In its first performance in Japan, the group was a surprise guest at 2011 AKB48 <i>Kōhaku Taikō Uta Gassen</i> and performed the Indonesian version of "Aitakatta". It also performed alongside AKB48 and other sister groups at the 62nd NHK <i>Kōhaku Uta Gassen</i> with a total 210 members onstage. It also participated in the 2012 AKB48 concerts at Saitama Super Arena and Tokyo Dome.
</p><p>On 13 August 2012, management began accepting applications for second generation members. Of the 4,500 applicants, approximately 200 were selected for interviews the following month. The pool was then narrowed down from 67 to 31 in a selection round held by RCTI. All 31 finalists were eventually chosen as second generation members at a final audition on 3 November in Japan. Additionally, AKB48 members Aki Takajō and Haruka Nakagawa, whose transfers to JKT48 were announced at the Tokyo Dome concert, officially began their activities with the group on 1 November and made their theater debut on 26 December. Nakagawa became interested in Jakarta during a visit with other members of AKB48 earlier in February 2012.

<p>JKT48 follows its Japanese sister group AKB48 in order to boost the record sales through a variety of marketing strategies. The main track for each single is sung by a team of "All Stars"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">選抜</span><span style="display:none">,</span> <i>senbatsu</i>, selection)</span> consisting of popular members from JKT48's teams, with one of the girls selected as the center performer or Center. The singles and albums are released in different types with alternate type and voting codes for annual election contests. Alan Swarts of MTV Japan has noted that collectors purchasing multiple copies of AKB48 CDs have inflated the market, and is one of the reasons Japan's music industry has been booming. Five elections have been held; most recently in 2018.

<p>JKT48 is billed as a "unique idol group with Indonesian culture". Harris Thayeb, President Director of the group's promotional agent Dentsu Media Group Indonesia, believed the group's concept "will make our idols more down to earth, being always nice and able to be greeted anytime". The group was seen as part of the "Cool Japan" brand adopted by the Japanese government to promote the country's culture around the world.
</p><p>On 25 February 2012, JKT48 held a joint concert with AKB48 at the Japan Pop Culture Festival at Balai Kartini in Jakarta. The event was sponsored by the Embassy of Japan, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs, and the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. According to Junji Shimada, deputy to the Japanese ambassador, AKB48 was invited to perform because of its status as a Japanese pop icon, and the two sister groups represent the friendship between Japan and Indonesia.
</p><p>JKT48 appeared in television shows almost daily after its debut and in television advertisements by Japanese companies that intend to capture a share of the rapidly growing Indonesian market. Otsuka Pharmaceutical hired JKT48 to promote the company's Pocari Sweat beverages one month after the group's first members were announced. Sharp Corporation selected JKT48 to appear at the company's promotional events, and Yamaha Motor Company hired the group in order to promote its line of fuel efficient Mio J scooters to Indonesian teens. Ezaki Glico also featured the group in its advertisements as part of an effort to grow sales in Indonesia to over Rp1 billion.
</p><p>Teenagers and single young men make up the largest portion of the JKT48 and AKB48 fan base. Furthermore, some believe JKT48's idol concept is not representative of Indonesian culture.
</p><p>In an attempt to attract young spectators, the Indonesia Asian Games Organizing Committee (INASGOC) collaborated with JKT48 during the 2018 Asian Games. They performed in select sporting events between 19 August and 1 September in a group consisted of eight members from each of its teams.
