<p><i>Dragon Ball GT</i> is the third anime series in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> franchise and a  sequel to the <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> anime series (Valga clarify that <i>Dragon Ball GT</i> does not belong to the story created by Akira Toriyama, so this is alternate to everything and even if it has passed to <i>Dragon Ball</i>, has no relation to <i>Dragon Ball Super</i>). Produced by Toei Animation, the series premiered in Japan on Fuji TV on February 7, 1996, spanning 64 episodes until its conclusion on November 19, 1997. Unlike the other anime series in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> franchise, <i>Dragon Ball GT</i> is not based on the manga series written by Akira Toriyama, but a project by Toei Animation; the same characters are used, and the series also continues the story where <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> had left off.
</p><p>Funimation licensed the series for an English language Region 1 DVD release and broadcast in the United States. Funimation's English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network from November 7, 2003 to April 16, 2005. The original television broadcast skipped the first 16 episodes of the series. Instead, Funimation created a composition episode entitled "A Grand Problem," which used scenes from the skipped episodes to summarize the story. The skipped episodes were later shown on Cartoon Network as "The Lost Episodes" after the original broadcast concluded. The series was later released to DVD in the Season set form. The first set was released on December 9, 2008, and the second set was released on February 10, 2009. A "Complete Series" DVD box set was later released on September 21, 2010. AB Groupe (in association with Blue Water Studios) developed an alternate dub for Europe and Canada and was aired on YTV and Toonami UK, which divided the episodes into two seasons instead of sagas. Funimation's English dub began re-airing in the U.S. on Nicktoons on January 16, 2012.
</p><p><i>Dragon Ball GT</i> uses five pieces of theme music. Field of View performs the series opening theme, "Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja"><b>DAN DAN 心魅かれてく</b></span>)</span>, which is used for all 64 episodes. "Hitori Janai"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">ひとりじゃない</span>)</span>, performed by Deen, is used for the ending theme for the first 26 episodes. Starting at episode 27, the series begins using Zard's "Don't You See!" for the ending theme. Episode 42 marks the next ending theme change, with "Blue Velvet" by Shizuka Kudō being used. "Sabitsuita Mashingan de Ima o Uchinukō"<span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">錆びついたマシンガンで今を撃ち抜こう</span>)</span>, performed by Wands, is introduced as an ending theme in episode 51. It was used as the ending theme for the remainder of the series, except for the final episode, which reused the opening theme for the series as the ending theme.

<p><i><b>A note on the "Saga" nomenclature:</b></i>
</p><p><i>The "sagas" that comprise the following list correspond to the sets released by Funimation. However, these "sagas" only correspond to story arcs (which are themselves split at debatable points), and not to the pattern in which the show actually aired in either Japan or the United States.</i>
</p><p><i>In Japan, Dragon Ball GT (like both of the previous Dragon Ball series) was aired year-round continuously, with regular off-days for sporting events and television specials.</i>

As Goku and Uub fight inside Dende's lookout, Emperor Pilaf scales the outside of the lookout, and sneaks in to the inner chamber, unnoticed. He finds the Black Star Dragon Balls, and summons the dragon so he can wish to take over the world. After Goku and Uub finally ended their training and Uub leaving the lookout after bidding farewell to Goku, Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world until he is interrupted by Goku as Pilaf discovers that Goku looks very familiar and Pilaf orders his assistants, Shu and Mai to fire the missiles at Goku, but Goku stops the missiles. Frustrated, he accidentally says that he wishes Goku were a child again so he could beat him up, unaware that the dragon is listening. The dragon grants this accidental wish, and Goku becomes a child. After Pilaf leaves, King Kai tells Goku that the only way he can return to normal is by finding the Black Star Dragon Balls, which are now scattered throughout the galaxy. However, Goku decides it will be easier to just grow up again after telling King Kai that he kinda likes being the size of a kid again, and he heads into town. There he finds Pan foiling a bank robbery while Pan is on a date and Pan discovers that the little boy is her grandfather after Goku sees Master Roshi again and Master Roshi recognizes Goku. He heads home for the first time in years with her, and explains to everyone what happened, which shocks Gohan, Videl and a crying Chi-Chi. King Kai interrupts their conversation. He has discovered that when a wish is made on the Black Star Dragon Balls, the planet the wish was made on will explode within one year unless the seven balls are brought back.</td></tr>

Bulma begins preparing the spaceship for Goku's journey. Gohan decides to go, as well, because he can help Goku find the Black Star Dragon Balls. Pan is very disappointed that she cannot go because she's too young. Everyone has been treating her like a child lately, and she is getting frustrated. When it's time for blast-off, Vegeta decides that Trunks and Goten should go instead of Gohan, because in his eyes, the two of them have gotten soft in this time of peace. This means that Trunks will be relieved of his duties as president of Capsule Corp and Goten can cancel his date. While Goten is saying goodbye to his girlfriend, Trunks and Goku board the ship, only to find that Pan has snuck into the control room. She hits the blast-off button before Goten can climb aboard. Now Goku, Trunks, and Pan begin their adventure as Goten can finally go back to dating his girlfriend.</td></tr>

Bulma finds a small part of the ship that fell off during takeoff. The absence of the part causes a jet to fall off of the ship. Trunks makes an emergency landing on the nearest planet, Imecka. Everyone on this planet tries to sell them things. Even the hotel they stay at charges them for every possible thing. They learn that this is all because of the new tyrannical king of Imecka. While walking back to the ship, Trunks drops the dragon radar, and it is eaten by a small robot. After they catch the robot, they see their spaceship being dragged away.</td></tr>

Goku, Trunks, and Pan land on the planet with the first Dragon Ball. Everything on this planet is massive. They find the four-star Dragon Ball lying under a tree, but before they can get it, a giant apple falls on it.

Goku meets a strange man named Sugoro, who challenges him to a life-sized board game. If Goku wins the game, he gets to keep his life and return to Earth, but if he loses, he must give up his life. To make matters worse, Goku is stripped of all of his powers, as they are "against the rules". They begin to play a game of chance, and Goku always seems to have bad luck, unlike Sugoro, who never has anything bad happen to him. This is because he cheats while Goku isn't looking. Back on Earth, Dende gives Baby the Black Star Dragon Balls, and he wishes for the Tuffle home planet to be restored in orbit around the Earth. He then gathers all of the Tuffles on Earth, and they begin to board a giant spaceship that will take them there.</td></tr>

As Majuub and Baby begin to fight on the Tuffle Planet, after numerous failed attempts to grow his Saiyan tail, Goku ties Elder Kai to a rock and tells him to hold on to the pliers. He flies away as hard as he can, which pulls his tail out to full length, successfully increasing his energy. Back on the Tuffle planet, Majuub creates a giant energy wave and aims it at Baby to turn. After a long struggle, Baby is able to deflect the wave back at Majuub. And as a result, Majuub is turned him into chocolate and devoured by Baby just as Goku reappears through Kibito Kai's teleportation only to see this incident, too late to save him. Now fueled by the loss of his trusted partner, Goku arrives and powers up to Super Saiyan 3 for a rematch after Baby discovers that Goku is still alive and he now has a tail. But even with his tail back, he does not seem to have gained any strength. Goku then charges at Baby, but the evil Tuffle grabs him by his tail (golden while in Super Saiyan 3), swirls him around in the air and throws him back to the ground, badly injuring him and causing him to regress back to his base form as he loses Super Saiyan 3 permanently. As Baby flies down to finish him this time, the now-depressed Goku realizes he is again no match for his foe, and then looks up at the Earth in the sky of the Tuffle Planet. Remembering his life with his friends and family on his home planet, and unable to bear his failure to protect them from Baby, Goku pleas for the power to "end this madness". Surprisingly, Goku absorbs the familiar energy reflecting off the Earth, the Blutz Waves, causing his tail to have a reaction, his heartbeat to increase by the time his eyes turn red, and his body to bulge. And then, he powers up in a gigantic Super Saiyan aura, finally transforming into a Great Ape: this time with golden fur (including his spiked hair). Though stunned by Goku's amazing new transformation, Baby refuses to believe that Saiyans can change into Great Apes without the full moon, until he realizes in horror that Goku has used the Earth as the moon's resemblance.</td></tr>

It is clear that he is now stronger than Baby, but in his present state, he can't focus his mind on fighting because, according to Elder Kai, he hasn't trained properly. Now succumbed to his animalistic Saiyan indistincts, Goku goes on a rampage, destroying everything in sight without even killing everyone controlled by Baby. Later, Goku is about to drink from the lake, until he again sees the Earth which he used to simulate the full moon for his transformation and climbs up the cliffs towards it.

Pan tries to bring her grandfather to his sense with almost everything including her outfit that she wears for the World Martial Arts Tournament, but Goku swats her away. Then she shows him a picture of their family and friends on a beach vacation on Earth, and combined with Pan's tears, this reminds Goku of who he is after Goku remembers the good times that he had at the beach, including the part where he tells Pan about the seawater tasting salty.

In his new form, Goku's powers are incredible and he is now an adult again, thanks to his newly-restored tail and the Earth's Blutz Waves. He tells Pan and Hercule that he will find Baby and will defeat him once and for all. On his tower, Baby and Bulma find a puzzling information on how did the Earth give Goku the Blutz Waves to become a Great Ape, and Bulma explain the reason Baby can't turn into one since he took control of Vegeta's body is that the Saiyan Prince no longer has a tail. Goku finds Baby, and they begin to fight. It seems like Baby still has the upper hand, but Goku reveals that he hasn't even been trying. Now on the offensive, Goku seems indestructible, and Baby is no match for him. Bulma contacts Baby, saying that she's found a way to focus Blutz Waves onto him, which would turn him into a Great Ape. It turns out that Bulma has created her Blutz Wave Generator. Using her generator, she hits him with this beam just before Goku releases a Kamehameha wave, and Baby transforms into a Golden Great Ape.

Now that he's at full power, Goku is much stronger than Baby. With no other way out, Baby hits Goku with his Revenge Death Ball. Goku is enveloped by the blast, but refuses to give up. He absorbs the energy. He then fires a powerful Kamehameha wave at Baby, knocking him unconscious. Goku then blasts away Baby's tail, causing him to regress into his earlier form. Knowing that he is greatly outmatched, Baby extracts himself from Vegeta's body and flees to his ship. Vegeta recovers, but Baby flies away. Determined to finish him off, Goku fires another Kamehameha wave at Baby's ship, blasting it into the sun. They head back to Earth before Goku returns to his child form and sprinkle the entire surface with sacred water, while Kibito Kai and Gohan do the same on the Tuffle planet.

Vegeta decides to evacuate the Earth's population to the Tuffle planet, using ships and Goku's Instant Transmission, which he can use again as a Super Saiyan 4. Mr. Satan convinces the people that the Earth really is going to explode. As the last ship is leaving Earth, Goku locates the last four stragglers, but someone realizes they left their son back on the planet. Goku finds him, along with Piccolo. He loses his Super Saiyan 4 form, and can't use Instant Transmission. Piccolo gives him his energy, allowing him to make one last trip.

The new dragon turns out to be pure evil.  He sucks up the Dragon Balls and then splits into seven more dragons, which then fly away.  Elder Kai explains that each time the Dragon Balls are used, they store negative energy, and that energy takes 100 years to dissipate.  The reason the balls scatter after they're used is to give them time to release their negative energy.  But because Bulma invented the dragon radar, they were able to find them very quickly and summon Shenron many times.  This overuse caused the balls to overload themselves with negative energy, and that energy spawned the Shadow Dragons. All those present blame Bulma for this, but she quickly places the blame on Goku, stating that she could never have found them without his help. In any event, Goku, feeling guilty for having used the Dragon Balls so often, goes off to slay the dragons, as they will potentially destroy the universe if left unchecked. Goku follows the destructive path left by the dragons, and Pan follows him, bringing Giru along to use the dragon radar.  They find the two-star dragon destroying a village.</td></tr>

But Pan's attacks seem to do less and less, until the dragon is able to overpower her. Goku tries to transform into a Super Saiyan and finds that he is unable to. The dragon explains that his pollution causes all living things to exponentially weaken, die and decay over a short period of time. This is why Pan's strength is gone, and why Goku can't power up. He also reveals that he was created when Goku wished to revive Bora, father of his old friend Upa, after he was killed by Mercenary Tao, horrifying Goku with the fact that he was indeed responsible for the creation of the Shadow Dragons.

He realizes that it's the right thing to do, so he reluctantly transforms into a Super Saiyan 4. Intending to kill the dragon, along with Pan, he hits the dragon with a Kamehameha wave. The dust clears, and the dragon is still alive. Goku couldn't bring himself to put all of the necessary energy into the blast. The dragon turns the tide of the fight, and appears to knock Goku out. He mockingly "grants Goku's wish" by letting him see Pan one last time.  He pushes Pan halfway out of him, and Goku grabs her and pulls her out.

Vegeta tries to leave for the fight to join Goku and the others, but Bulma convinces him to stay. She says that she's working on something that will help him. While she's preparing the device, Vegeta reminisces about Goku in the past; everything from their first fight when he was once evil (though he was still good in the present), to Goku's fight with Frieza when he first transformed into a Super Saiyan, to their fight when he was Majin Vegeta (half evil, half good), to their fight with Kid Buu. Bulma then explains how Goku became Super Saiyan 4 in the fight against Baby on the Tuffle planet: when Goku looked at the Earth from the Tuffle planet as if it were a full moon, he transformed into a Golden Great Ape because the Blutz Waves he absorbed were naturally being created by the Earth, in the same way as if they only reflect from the moon. Pan helped him become conscious of himself, and this made him transform again into the final Super Saiyan 4 stage. Since Vegeta is already conscious of himself as a regular Great Ape, theoretically he just needs to be bombarded with Blutz Waves to make the transformation to Super Saiyan Great Ape and then he can become a Super Saiyan 4. Bulma hypothesizes that Vegeta didn't transform into a Super Saiyan 4 while Baby was possessing him as a Super Saiyan Great Ape because Vegeta wasn't conscious. To create these Blutz Waves, Bulma has built a mobile version of the machine that she built for Baby on the Tuffle planet while she was possessed by one of Baby's parasitic offspring.</td></tr>

Goku and Nuova, the four-star dragon, begin to fight in earnest. Goku catches Nuova off guard, but grants him a freebie because Nuova spared Pan's life at Goku's request when he could have easily destroyed her.  Nuova says that he doesn't harm innocent and helpless people.  As they continue to fight, a beam comes out of nowhere and hits Goku's arm, freezing it.  It came from Eis Shenron, the three-star dragon, and Nuova's twin brother, who was (as revealed in Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files) brought forth by the wish that erased the memories of Majin Buu from everyone on Earth excluding the Z Fighters and their friends.  Eis has taken the Dragon Balls from Pan, and he gives them to Nuova.  He then freezes the rest of Goku.  Eis commands Nova to finish Goku off, but Nuova refuses because Goku can't defend himself.

Goku and Eis begin to fight. When the battle is in Goku's favor, Eis resorts to dirty tricks, such as using the unconscious Pan and even his own brother as human shields. Eis freezes him again, but Goku is able to break free, and he beats the dragon.  As Eis is begging for mercy, he suddenly slashes Goku's eyes, blinding him.  Goku is able to quickly land a devastating punch, which finishes off the three-star dragon. Nuova hands Goku special eye drops to cure his blindness, but they are shot out of his hand. It was the one-star dragon, Syn Shenron, who was created (also revealed in Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files) by the wish that revived all victims of Frieza and his men.  He quickly destroys Nuova, leaving only a blind Goku to fight him.  An enraged and disgusted Goku criticizes him for killing one of his own kind, but Syn merely reminds him that Goku is responsible for the birth of all Shadow Dragons because he overused the Dragon Balls. Undaunted, Goku states that he always used the Dragon Balls for the good of the Earth and never used them selfishly even once, and tries to fight, but even when he lands a Kamehameha wave, he isn't able to do any damage to the one-star dragon.  The dragon lands a powerful hit, which knocks Goku unconscious.  Pan regains consciousness, and is horrified to see Goku hanging upside-down from a pole.</td></tr>

Shenron heals Goku, and explains that he can't allow everyone to overuse the Dragon Balls again, so he is leaving the Earth, and taking the balls with him, planning to return when the people of Earth learn to solve their own problems without using the balls. However, he allows one more wish at Goku's request, which is to repair all damage done to the Earth since the gateway to Hell was opened up by Android 17, as well as revive all the innocent people who have been killed. Just before Shenron leaves, he calls for Goku to accompany him. Goku entrusts Vegeta to take his place as Earth's savior, and as they fly away, Bulma reminisces about her time with Goku. Unexpectedly, Pan finds Goku's clothes on the ground, and Vegeta tells her to treasure them dearly before he and the other Z-warriors leave. Goku stops by Kame House to say goodbye to Master Roshi and Krillin, who has been revived. He also stops in hell to say goodbye to Piccolo, and tells him that he will one day get back into Heaven. As he lies on the back of Shenron, the seven Dragon Balls become one with Goku's body, and he becomes one with Shenron as Shenron finally vanishes. 100 years later, all of the Z-warriors have passed away of old age except for Pan, Vegeta Jr., Vegeta's descendant, and Goku Jr., Goku's descendant and Pan's grandson, are fighting in the junior division championship match at the World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku Jr. is wearing Goku's clothes that Pan picked up many years ago. Pan looks down and sees the now-adult Goku watching the fight, but when she goes down to find him, he's not there anymore; Pan merely assumes that she was imagining things. As Goku exits the stadium, he flashes back to many of the events that shaped his past, from his adoption by Grandpa Gohan to Baby's defeat. With his Power Pole in hand, Goku flies off on the Flying Nimbus into the distance and says "Til we meet again, guys."</td></tr>
