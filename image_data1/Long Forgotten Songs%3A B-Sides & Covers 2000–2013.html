<p><i><b>Long Forgotten Songs: B-Sides &amp; Covers 2000–2013</b></i> is a compilation album by American rock band Rise Against, released on September 10, 2013. The album comprises twenty-six lesser known Rise Against songs, primarily B-sides, covers and different versions of already existing songs by the band. The idea for the album came about when the members of Rise Against attempted to catalog their lesser known material, but came to the conclusion that there were some songs that they did not own copies of. <i>Long Forgotten Songs</i> peaked at number nineteen on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and charted in several other countries. The album received generally favorable reviews; several critics said the covers were the best aspect of the album, and noted how many of the songs felt fully fleshed out despite being relegated to B-sides.

<p>While backstage at the 2013 Orion Music + More festival, the members of Rise Against attempted to catalog their lesser known B-sides and covers, but came to the conclusion that there were some songs that they did not own copies of. These songs were often included in Fat Music compilation albums or soundtrack albums. As lead singer Tim McIlrath put it: "If the four of us don't have these songs, who really does?" The band members thought that since there were enough lesser known songs to fill an entire album, it would be interesting to make a compilation album for these songs.
</p><p>McIlrath described <i>Long Forgotten Songs</i> as "a trip down memory lane" for the band members and their fans. The album comprises twenty-six tracks that span nearly thirteen years, and includes various B-sides, covers, and different versions of existing Rise Against songs. <i>Long Forgotten Songs</i> is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic punk, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships to politics. Among the album's covers include Bob Dylan's "Ballad of Hollis Brown", Journey's "Any Way You Want It", Nirvana's "Sliver", and Bruce Springsteen's "The Ghost of Tom Joad". The cover of "The Ghost of Tom Joad" in particular is a live recording from 2012, with MC5's Wayne Kramer, the Gaslight Anthem's Brian Fallon, and Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello.
</p><p>Some songs on <i>Long Forgotten Songs</i> were included as bonus tracks for previous Rise Against albums. For example, "Lanterns" was an iTunes bonus track for <i>Endgame</i>. Bassist Joe Principe explained how the song was a nod to the older sound of Rise Against, but its sound did not match the overall musical style of the album. He further explained that this was the reason why many of the songs on <i>Long Forgotten Songs</i> were chosen as B-sides; these songs did not fit the musical style or lyrical themes of the parent album.
