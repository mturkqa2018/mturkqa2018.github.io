<ul><li>Lolo Edad/Vicente Kabisote Sr. - father of enteng Kabisote played by Bayani Casimiro Sr.</li>
<li>Enteng Kabisote / Vicente Kabisote, Jr. - a repairman/mechanic, portrayed by Vic Sotto. During the start of the show, he was on the run from a girl who was forcing him to marry her through the threats of her muscled brothers. To escape from her, Enteng adopted a street-girl named Aiza and pretended that he already has a daughter from a previous marriage. The girl, not being bothered by this, still pursued Enteng. Unknown to him, Princess Chlorateam was watching him from the Queendom of Engkantasya and fell for him. To aid him in his escape, she magically teleported him to Engkantasya as he fell asleep. When he woke up, he immediately fell for her charms and wanted to marry her. The two of them then returned to Earth and got married, with Aiza as their witness.</li></ul>
<p>Throughout the run of the show, Enteng maintained a normal life, as well as his sanity, trying to cope with all the magical changes that has been happening in his life since he married a fairy princess. He serves as the moral center of the story and the series focused on how Enteng struggled to keep the forces of evil from conquering him and the people that matter to him.
</p>
<ul><li>Faye - is the mortal name that Princess Chlorateam used when she married Enteng Kabisote. She is the sole heir of Inang Reyna Magenta for the throne of Engkantasya. After her marriage, Faye limited her use of her magic powers to cope with Enteng's normal life. Initially, it was very difficult for her to live her new life on Earth, but with the love and support of her husband, she adjusted well.</li></ul>
<p>There had been several actresses (and in one instance, an actor) who portrayed this role. When the show started, it was newcomer Alice Dixson who played Faye. She left the show 2 years after and was replaced by model turned actress Tweetie de Leon. She stayed with the show for 4 years until she got married. She also starred in its first 2 movies, Okey Ka, Fairy Ko!, The Movie, and Okey Ka, Fairy Ko! II. During the transition, actor Roderick Paulate, known for his comedic gay roles, filled the spot. After Tweetie de Leon left the show and TAPE Inc. transferring to a different channel (GMA Network), Faye's character was absent for 2 months. She returned to the show being portrayed by a new actress, Dawn Zulueta. She stayed on the show until it ended airing. Kristine Hermosa played the role of Faye in the four movie installments of <i>Enteng Kabisote</i>. On the movies Si Agimat at si Enteng Kabisote, Enteng ng Ina Mo, and Si Agimat, si Enteng Kabisote at si Ako, newcomer Gwen Zamora portrayed Faye and recently in Enteng Kabisote 10 and the Abangers, Vic Sotto's wife Pauleen Luna portrayed Faye.
</p>
<ul><li>Ina Magenta - is the mother of Faye who always intrudes in the life of the couple. Enteng sees her as the main antagonist of his life, always reminding him how low she thinks of him being a mortal, even calling him Tagalupa (earthling), and how much she wishes that her daughter had married someone else of fairy origin. Enteng counters her intimidation with his sarcastic remarks that even fuels her disapproval of her daughter's marriage to him. Despite this kind of relationship, Ina Magenta honors the fact that Enteng loves her daughter very much and all her insults are a mere part of her daily routine.</li></ul>
<p>Ina Magenta is so called, because she is the Inang Reyna (queen mother) of Engkantasya Magenta, one of the regions, and the main city, of the Queendom of Engkantasya. She is strong-willed, yet compassionate as a ruler, and upholds the power of good over the forces of darkness, that are a consistent threat in the Okey ka, Fairy ko! Universe. Charito Solis portrayed this role throughout the run of the series and the second movie installment of the series. For the new generation, Giselle Toengi was cast as Ina Magenta in Enteng Kabisote: Okay Ka, Fairy Ko: The Legend Continues. The change of face was supported by the fact that Ina Magenta went into a "fairy" plastic surgery by the famed Derma Lily (can be a pun for Regal Films matriarch "Mother" Lily Monteverde). The second Enteng Kabisote Franchise brought a new yet "old" face for Ina Magenta. This time it was the original Faye (Alice Dixson) who was cast as Ina Magenta. For the third installment however, Giselle Toengi reprised her role. Here, it was explained that for Ina Magenta to rule the Kingdom quite effectively, she should maintain her freshness and beauty (vanity at its pureness). Now as the story unravels, Ina Magenta's vanity has a price to pay. As she and the other fairies are ogling to a lot of photos (where they would copy the face of the model), Ina Magenta accidentally points to a "man". Thus, Allan K. comes. For the whole course of the movie, Allan K portrayed Ina Magenta. Though after having fallen from their duel with Satana and asking Bathala for help, Ina Magenta morphed back to Giselle Toengi. On the movies Si Agimat at si Enteng Kabisote, Enteng ng Ina Mo, and Si Agimat, si Enteng Kabisote at si Ako, once again another actress portrayed the role of Ina Magenta: Amy Perez.
</p>
<ul><li>Aiza - the first child of the Kabisotes, portrayed by Aiza Seguerra. For the whole course of the series and the 2 movie installments, Aiza was the only daughter of the Kabisotes, and usually was the target of Luka's devious plans.</li>
<li>Amy - The nosy, yet trustworthy housekeeper of the Kabisotes, played by Ruby Rodriguez. Amy had seen a lot of weird happenings in the Kabisote's household, yet her memory is constantly erased by either Faye, Ina Magenta, or any of the fairies.</li>
<li>Bale - The store-owner just adjacent to the Kabisotes' house. Bale and Amy share a lot of gossips and a lot of misadventures. Present throughout the run of the series and the first 2 movie installments. Bale was never mentioned during the 2nd installment of the <i>Enteng Kabisote</i> movies until recently in <i>Enteng Kabisote 3: Okay ka, Fairy Ko... The Legend Goes On and On and On</i>. Wherein Jinky Oda made a cameo reprising her role as Bale.</li>
<li>Pipoy - Enteng's bald and bellicose assistant in his repair shop. He was one of the brothers of the girl who ran after enteng kabisote to marry her at the beginning episode of the show. He was portrayed by Larry Silva.</li>
<li>Prinsipe K - A tap-dancing fairy noted for his outrageous entrances whenever he is called and his large, elf-like ears. He was portrayed by Bayani Casimiro Jr., son of comedian Bayani Casimiro, Sr. The father incidentally was also in the cast of the show during its early runs, playing the father to Enteng Kabisote, until his eventual, real-life demise. "Prinsipe K" is short for "Prinsipe ng Kahilingan" ("Prince of Wishes").</li>
<li>Yaya Engkantada - a fairy nanny. Never mentioned during the <i>Enteng Kabisote</i> installments of the series. Played by Debraliz.</li>
<li>Benok - The first son of the Kabisotes. Unfortunately the series was about to end when he was introduced so his character was not explored to the hilt. Oyo Boy Sotto, Vic Sotto's son in real life played the young Benok for Okay Ka Fairy Ko's first season on GMA-7 until he was replaced by CJ Ramos. After the TV series ended Benok made his debut at the Enteng Kabisote movie installment. Oyo Boy was cast again as Benok in the movies. He was originally portrayed in the first "Enteng" movie as a "pasaway" (brat) who's always disobedient and answers back to his parents and Ate Aiza. Eventually, his character had a change of heart after his mother Faye was kidnapped by Satana and became his father's ally in various battles against dark forces. In the second and third "Enteng" movies, Benok's characterization focused more on his appeal with women, a direct junior version of his father Enteng. In the fourth installment of "Enteng", Benok matures and becomes a Police Officer.</li>
<li>Ada - introduced at the second <i>Enteng Kabisote</i> movie. Angel Sy, portrayed the fast-growing child. In the 3rd &amp; 4th installment, Mikylla Ramirez plays Ada.</li>
<li>Luka - Throughout the whole course of the series and the first installment of the Okay Ka Fairy Ko series, Luka was the main villain. She was the Reyna ng Kadiliman as opposed to Ina Magenta. Her presence can be felt due to her stench. Luz Fernandez played the role.</li>
<li>Muñita - Tetchie Agbayani portrayed this character. She was Luka's henchman who eventually usurped the throne as Queen of Kadiliman. Muñita (probably from the word "demonyita," meaning "female devil") also became the main villain in the second Okay Ka Fairy Ko movie. She always tried to seduce Enteng but to no avail.</li>
<li>Satana - Formerly known as Amarillo, she ran away from Engkantasya when she was young and came back as the vile Satana. She was ever so jealous of the powers and domains her sisters received from their father. In Enteng Kabisote 2, it was revealed that Satana is Ina Magenta's prodigal sister. There was an instance in the TV series where Satana's character was portrayed by veteran actress Odette Khan, thereby completing the evil fairy triad. In the latter 3 movie installments of the series, her character is portrayed by actress Bing Loyzaga.</li></ul>
