<p>More than one hundred full-length <i>BattleTech</i> or <i>MechWarrior</i> science fiction novels have been published by FASA Corporation and later ROC, and have been translated into at least fifteen languages.  The novels take place in the fictional BattleTech universe of the 31st and 32nd centuries and can be considered space opera.
</p><p>The first official <i>BattleTech</i> novel was William H. Keith's <i>Decision at Thunder Rift</i> (1986); the last from FASA was Loren L. Coleman's <i>Endgame</i> (2002) which resolved plot lines and character arcs from many previous works.  Subsequent publications jump ahead chronologically to the 32nd-century <i>MechWarrior: Dark Age</i> setting, beginning with Michael A. Stackpole's <i>Ghost War</i> (2002) and ending with Kevin Killiany's <i>To Ride the Chimera</i> (2008).  The closure in 2008 of WizKids delayed the release of further novels.
</p><p>Catalyst Game Labs received the rights to publish both Classic and Dark Age book lines and had scheduled new works to resume in the fall of 2009, however no novels ever materialized.  The Dark Age-era series, originally known as <i>Mechwarrior: Dark Age</i>, has been renamed <i>Battletech: Dark Age</i>.

<p>The following novels occur during what was referred to the "Classic BattleTech" era, which includes the 31st century and preceding centuries. Also, additional eras have been added, broadening the term. The Classic reference was dropped after the ownership change and re-branding occurred.
