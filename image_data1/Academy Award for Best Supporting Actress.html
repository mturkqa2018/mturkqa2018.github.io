<p>The <b>Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress</b> is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a supporting role while working within the film industry. The award was traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Supporting Actor winner.
</p><p>At the 9th Academy Awards ceremony held in 1937, Gale Sondergaard was the first winner of this award for her role in <i>Anthony Adverse</i>. Initially, winners in both supporting acting categories were awarded plaques instead of statuettes. Beginning with the 16th ceremony held in 1944, winners received full-sized statuettes. Currently, nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy.
</p><p>Since its inception, the award has been given to 81 actresses. Dianne Wiest and Shelley Winters have received the most awards in this category with two awards each. Despite winning no awards, Thelma Ritter was nominated on six occasions, more than any other actress. As of the 2019 ceremony, Regina King is the most recent winner in this category for her role as Sharon Rivers in <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>.
