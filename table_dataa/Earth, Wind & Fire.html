<p>In 1969, Maurice White, a former session drummer for Chess Records and former member of the Ramsey Lewis Trio, joined two friends in Chicago, Wade Flemons and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team composing songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends eventually got a recording contract with Capitol Records. Calling themselves "The Salty Peppers", they went on to have a marginal hit single in the Midwestern area entitled "La La Time".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The Salty Peppers' second single, "Uh Huh Yeah", did not fare as well. Maurice moved on from Chicago to Los Angeles. He added to the band singer Sherry Scott and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, and then asked his younger brother Verdine how he would feel about heading out to the West Coast. On June 6, 1970, Verdine left Chicago to join the band as their new bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes of the band, featuring Donny Hathaway, around to different record labels and the band was thus signed to Warner Bros. Records.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>

<p>Maurice's astrological sign, Sagittarius, has a primary elemental quality of Fire and seasonal qualities of Earth and Air, according to classical triplicities. Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of Water, the fourth classical element. Based on this, he changed the band's name, to "Earth, Wind &amp; Fire". Maurice held further auditions in L.A. where he added Michael Beal on guitar, Chester Washington on reeds, and Leslie Drayton on trumpet. With Maurice as a percussionist and lead vocalist Drayton also served as the group's musical arranger. Trombonist Alex Thomas completed the then ten-man EWF lineup.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The band's self-titled debut album was eventually released in February 1971 on Warner Bros. The album got to No. 24 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Soul Albums chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>EWF also performed on the soundtrack of the Melvin Van Peebles feature film <i>Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</i>. The soundtrack was released in June 1971 on Stax Records and reached No. 13 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top R&amp;B Albums chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In November 1971 EWF's sophomore album entitled <i>The Need of Love</i> was issued. It got to No. 35 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Soul Albums chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>AllMusic described the album as an "ambitious" LP with an "abstract sense of composition". <i>Billboard</i> called the LP "a display of good potential, rock and pop".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>An album cut called "I Think About Lovin' You" reached No. 44 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Soul Songs chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The band developed a growing popularity on college campuses but, in spite of this, some members of EWF started to become restless and the band broke up after having been together less than six months. With only Verdine left, Maurice decided to re-form the group.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In 1972, Maurice added vocalist Helena Davis, Ronnie Laws on the flute and saxophone, rhythm guitarist Roland Bautista, keyboardist Larry Dunn, vocalist Philip Bailey and percussionist Ralph Johnson to the group. Davis was soon replaced by Jessica Cleaves, a former member of the R&amp;B group The Friends of Distinction.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The band successfully auditioned for managers Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo. Cavallo's management of John Sebastian led to a series of gigs as the opening act for the pop/folk singer and The Lovin' Spoonful founder. A performance at New York's Rockefeller Center introduced EWF to Clive Davis, then the President of Columbia Records. Davis was very impressed with the band's performance and bought out their contract from Warner Bros.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Their debut album on CBS/Columbia Records, <i>Last Days and Time</i> was issued in October 1972. Allmusic described Last Days and Time as a mix of "Motown pop, funk and folk", "Sly and The Family Stone's r&amp;b" and "the fusion style of Weather Report". <i>Billboard</i> noted a "dynamic soul rock style" as the "main ingredients" of the album.
The album got to No. 15 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Soul Albums chart. An album cut entitled "Mom" also got to No. 39 on the Cashbox Top R&amp;B Singles chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Soon thereafter Roland Bautista and Ronnie Laws left the band to pursue new musical opportunities Denver native Philip Bailey recommended his former East High School classmate, saxophonist Andrew Woolfolk as a replacement for Laws. Woolfolk had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro Joe Henderson and was due to start a career in banking at the time. To fill the void created by Bautista's departure, guitarists Al McKay and Johnny Graham were added to round out the new lineup. Graham previously played with the R&amp;B group New Birth while McKay was a former member of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue and The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>EWF's fourth studio album <i>Head to the Sky</i> was released in May 1973. The album rose to Nos. 2 &amp; 27 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Soul Albums and <i>Billboard</i> 200 charts respectively. Head to the Sky has also been certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Rolling Stone declared that on the album EWF "sound cosmic" with music that's full of "purity", "fluid" and "mostly distinctive". Billboard also noted that the band "does everything well" on the LP.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>An album cut entitled "Evil" got to Nos. 19 &amp; 25 on the <i>Billboard</i> Adult Contemporary Songs and Hot Soul Songs charts respectively. The single "Keep Your Head to the Sky" rose to No. 23 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Soul Songs chart. Jessica Cleaves left the band after the release of this album.

<p>The band's follow-up album was co-produced by Maurice and Joe Wissert, with Charles Stepney serving as an associate producer. Stepney had previously worked with artists such as The Dells, The Rotary Connection, Terry Callier, Minnie Riperton, and Ramsey Lewis. This LP was recorded at Colorado's Caribou Ranch Studio and issued under the title of <i>Open Our Eyes</i> in March 1974. <i>Rolling Stone</i> called <i>Open Our Eyes</i> an LP with lots of "positive elements". Music critic Robert Christgau described the album as a complete "tour de force". The album rose to Nos. 1 &amp; 15 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Soul Albums and Top Pop Albums charts respectively. <i>Open Our Eyes</i> was certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>A song from the LP dubbed "Mighty Mighty" reached Nos. 4 &amp; 29 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>On April 6, 1974, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire performed at the California Jam, a West Coast rock festival that attracted an audience of 200,000. The concert was televised in the US on May 10, 1974 by ABC.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>The band collaborated with Ramsey Lewis on his album <i>Sun Goddess</i> which was issued in late 1974 by Columbia. The album got to Nos. 1 &amp; 12 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Soul Albums and <i>Billboard</i> 200 charts respectively.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>In 1975, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire was approached by Sig Shore, producer of the motion picture <i>Super Fly,</i> to record the soundtrack to a new film entitled <i>That's the Way of the World.</i> With a screenplay from Robert Lipsyte, the movie was produced and directed by Shore. The film starred Harvey Keitel, Ed Nelson, EWF as the "The Group" and Maurice as Early, "The Group"'s leader.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>When the band saw the film they were convinced that it would become a box office bomb, which it eventually was. They therefore released the movie's soundtrack before the film's premiere. Co-produced by Maurice White and Charles Stepney and recorded at the Caribou Ranch Studio, <i>That's the Way of the World</i> was issued in March 1975 by Columbia. The album rose to No. 1 on both the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and Top Soul Albums charts. The album was warmly received by critics. <i>Billboard Magazine</i> called it "a very tightly produced and performed package." The BBC described it as a "soul masterpiece". With the LP, EWF became the first black act to top both the <i>Billboard</i> album and singles charts. The album was certified Triple Platinum in the US by the RIAA.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Off the LP came the single "Shining Star", which rose to number one on both the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts.

They were composed of saxophonist Don Myrick, trombonist Louis Satterfield, and trumpeters Rahmlee Davis and Michael Harris. Myrick and Satterfield had both worked with Maurice during his days as a session drummer at Chess Records.

Maurice loaned the band's signature Phenix Horns and most of the other band members and put on tour with Earth, Wind &amp; Fire these artists and others who were signed to Kalimba Productions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>While co-producing and arranging Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's follow-up LP, Deniece Williams's debut album, <i>This Is Niecy,</i> Ramsey Lewis's <i>Salongo,</i> and The Emotions's <i>Flowers</i>, their first album on Columbia Records, Charles Stepney died of a heart attack on May 17, 1976 in Chicago at the age of 43.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>During this period EWF concerts started to become loaded with pyrotechnics, magic, laser lights, flying pyramids, levitating guitarists and elaborate production tricks that included the entire group ascending in a pyramid and a disappearing act. The stage magician Doug Henning was thus with many of their tours with his young assistant and eventual successor, David Copperfield. The band also began to be choreographed by George Faison.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> where they performed a cover of The Beatles's "Got to Get You into My Life". The song was eventually added to the movie's soundtrack. However, the film was a commercial failure, as <i>That's the Way of the World</i> had been years before.
