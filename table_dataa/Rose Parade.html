<p>The <b>Rose Parade</b>, hosted by the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, is an annual parade held mostly along Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California, on New Year's Day (or on Monday, January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday). Usually beginning in the morning at 8:00Â a.m. Pacific Time (UTCâ€“8), it is produced by the non-profit Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association and includes flower-covered floats, marching bands, and equestrian units. The parade is followed in the afternoon by the Rose Bowl, one of the major bowl games in college football.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>First held on January 1, 1890, the Rose Parade is watched in person by hundreds of thousands of spectators on the parade route, and is broadcast on multiple television networks in the United States. It is seen by millions more on television worldwide in more than 100 international territories and countries. The Rose Bowl college football game was added in 1902 to help fund the cost of staging the parade. Since 2011, the parade has been sponsored by Honda. Accordingly, the company has the parade's first float, which like all floats, follows the parade's theme.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Rose Parade 2018 featured 44 floats, 20 equestrian units with approximately 400 horses, and 21 marching bands. The theme of this 129th Rose Parade was "Making a Difference" and the Grand Marshal of the parade was Gary Sinise.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Members of Pasadena's Valley Hunt Club first staged the parade in 1890. Since then the parade has been held in Pasadena every New Year's Day, except when January 1 falls on a Sunday. In that case, it is held on the subsequent Monday, January 2. This exception was instituted in 1893, as organizers did not wish to disturb horses hitched outside Sunday church services. (This event was held even during both World War years.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American East and Midwest. They wished to showcase their new California home's mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor Charles F. Holder announced, "In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>So the club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot that attracted a crowd of 2,000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the professor decided to suggest the name "Tournament of Roses."

<p>Over the next few founding years, marching bands and motorized floats were added. By 1895, the event was too large for the Valley Hunt Club to handle, hence the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association was formed. By the 11th annual tournament (1900), the town lot on which the activities were held was renamed Tournament Park, a large open area directly adjacent to Pasadena's world-famous institution of higher learning, Caltech. Activities soon included ostrich races, bronco busting demonstrations, and an odd novelty race between a camel and an elephant. (The elephant won the race.)  Soon reviewing stands were built along the parade route and newspapers in Eastern Seaboard cities started to take notice of the event.

<p>The stately Italian Renaissance-style mansion of William Wrigley Jr. (the maker of Wrigley's chewing gum) was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley's death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade's permanent headquarters. Tournament House is the name given the former home where the organization is headquartered.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The first associated football game was played on January 1, 1902. Originally titled the "Tournament East-West football game," it is considered to be the first Rose Bowl. The next game was not played until New Year's Day 1916; they have been played annually since then. The game derives its modern name from Rose Bowl Stadium, which was built for the 1923 game.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In 2002 and 2006 (when the Rose Bowl Game was the BCS National Championship Game), the "Granddaddy of 'em all" was not held the same day as the parade; the 2002 game was played on January 3, the 2006 game was played on January 4. Not all fans were pleased with the change; some thought the atmosphere and tradition of the Rose Bowl were lost. Once the BCS title game was separated from the host bowl, it no longer affected the date of the Rose Bowl Game (even when the title game returned to Pasadena in 2010 and 2014).

<p>The Tournament of Roses Parade has followed the same route mainly following Colorado Boulevard (Pasadena's main thoroughfare and a segment of the former US 66) for many decades. The day before the parade, the entire environs of the neighborhood streets south of the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado Blvds. are sealed off and reserved for the marshaling of the dozens of floats, bands, equestrian units, and other elements. This staging area is referred to as the "Formation Area" and is managed by the Formation Area Committee.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>On parade morning the various elements are merged and dispatched in front of Tournament House. The parade starts headed north on South Orange Grove Boulevard beginning at Green Street. At Colorado Boulevard it passes the main grandstands (and the main television and media stands) and proceeds east on Colorado Boulevard. The parade then turns north on Sierra Madre Boulevard. The floats then must travel under the Sierra Madre Boulevard/I-210 freeway overpass, requiring over-height floats to reduce their height. The parade ends at Paloma Street near Victory Park and Pasadena High School. Floats continue into the Post-Parade viewing area (which is open that afternoon and the following day). In total this route is 5.5 miles (8.9Â km) long; the assembled bands, horse units and floats take approximately two hours to pass by.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The 2010 parade saluted the men and women serving America throughout the world with a flyover at the beginning of the parade by four F-18 jets  (performed by pilots of the Fighting Redcocks of Strike Fighter Squadron 22 (VFA-22) from the Naval Air Station at Lemoore, California).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>New floats that joined the 2011 Rose Parade were: Beverly Hills Tournament of Roses Committee, Cunard Line, Dole, Los Angeles County Firemen's Benefit &amp; Welfare: Never Forget 9/11 "Remember, Reflect, Renew", UNO 40th Anniversary, "Messina Wildlife Management", Namco Bandai Games Inc., "Quikrete" Cement &amp; Concrete Products, "Saving America's Mustangs Foundation", and Shriner's Hospitals For Children.

The honor for being the last units in the parade went to All American Cowgirl Chicks (Equestrian), Needham Broughton High School (Band), and RFD-TV (Float). It also featured the first ever Swedish entry, the Royal Swedish Navy Cadet Band.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The 2013 parade featured 42 floats, 23 marching bands and 21 equestrian units. New for the 2013 Rose Parade were floats from Nurses' float "A Healing Place", Delta Sigma Theta, and the city of San Gabriel centennial float "Celebrating Our Journey". It began with the Wells Fargo/Opening Unit, American Honda's float, the U.S. Marine Corps's Mounted Color Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band.
Farmers Insurance's "Love Float" featured the wedding of a Virginia couple, Nicole and Gerald of Chesapeake, VA, which was officiated by nationally syndicated radio personality Sean Valentine. The couple was selected through a  first-ever public vote by the American people. The parade's closing unit featured Coco Jones of the Disney Channel.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Featured in the 2014 parade were 45 floats, including new floats from eHarmony, K9s4COPS, Public Storage ("Adventures In Space") and SeaWorld. Actor, director, writer, producer Garry Marshall played the role of "director" on Burbank's "Lights...camera...action!" float. KC and the Sunshine Band were featured on Stella Rosa Wine's "Stellabrate Good Times" float. Performing on the e-Harmony float was Natalie Cole, singing "This Will Be". NBC's <i>The Voice</i> joined this parade too, along with Daryl Hall and the Harlem Globetrotters. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation float ("Living the Dream: Love Is the Best Protection") featured a wedding of a California couple, Aubrey Loots and Danny Leclair; some people called for a boycott of the parade as the couple were both men. Nancy O'Dell, along with Jonathan and Drew Scott (of the <i>Property Brothers</i>) co-hosted the parade.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The 2015 parade had 41 floats. New participants were ABC's <i>The Bachelor</i>, American Armenian Rose Float Association, Kiehl's Since 1851, Northwestern Mutual, United Sikh Mission and Zappos.com.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Rose Parade floats</div>
<p>Originally the parade featured flower-decorated horse carriages. Over time, floats built by volunteers from sponsoring communities supplanted the carriages. Currently most are built by professional float building companies and take nearly a year to construct. Some communities and organizational sponsors still rely on volunteers. The Valley Hunt Club still enters a flower-decorated carriage. The Cal Poly Universities Rose Float still relies solely on students who volunteer. Floats are self-propelled on (generally used-up) truck chassis in contrast to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade which uses trailer-based floats pulled by new, intact (sponsor-provided) trucks.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Typically 48 to 72 hours prior to parade day, one can view several of the floats being decorated with flowery mantles in the various 'float barns' that dot the Arroyo Seco / Rose Bowl area in West Pasadena, not far from the start of the parade. It is a rule of the parade that all surfaces of the float framework must be covered in natural materials (such as flowers, plants, seaweeds, seeds, bark, vegetables, or nuts, for example); furthermore, no artificial flowers or plant material are allowed, nor can the materials be artificially colored. Last-minute volunteer opportunities are usually available.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Anaheim city's float at the 2008 Rose Parade included the Stanley Cup that the NHL's Anaheim Ducks had won last season, hoisted by player Brad May. (As the regulations state that the outside of the float must exclusively use organic material, ABC commentators speculated that the city got an exception to display the Cup.) Also, the Los Angeles Dodgers had a float in celebration of the franchise's 50th anniversary in Los Angeles, with Hall of Fame sportscasters Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin as well as former players Steve Garvey, Fernando Valenzuela, Eric Karros, and Nomar Garciaparra.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>The 2010 parade floats included the Boy Scouts of America's 100th Anniversary float, the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles in celebration of Mexico's bicentennial of independence, and "Safety Harbor Kids". The 2010 parade also featured a 113-foot-long (34Â m) float from Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Pet Foods, which set a Guinness world record for the longest single-chassis float. The City of West Covina paid tribute to the "service and commitment of the Tuskegee Airmen" with a float entitled <i>"Tuskegee Airmen â€“ A Cut Above"</i>, which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II "Redtails" fighter planes, and historical images of some of the airmen who served our country. The float won the Mayor's trophy as the most outstanding city entry â€“ national or international, also Anaheim float featured the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game that was played at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, four former MLB All-Stars, pitchers Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, and Troy Percival, along with second baseman Bobby Grich were aboard.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>Since January 1, 2012, fell on a Sunday, tradition dictated that the parade would be held on Monday, January 2, 2012. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, featuring the LMU Centennial Celebration float, and the Girl Scouts of the USA 100th Anniversary float (entitled <i>"What Will You Do Today?"</i>). Float builder Fiesta Floats donated their services to the design of the Girl Scouts float, which was decorated by the organization's volunteers (of all ages). Paramount Pictures also participated in the 2012 parade with its centennial celebration float "<i>100 Years of Movie Magic"</i>. Namco Bandai Games joined the parade for the first time, commemorating the Power Rangers. Others were Microsoft Kinect ("<i>You are the Controller"</i>) and the Kit-Cat Klock (<i>"Timeless Fun for Everyone"</i>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>The floats compete for one of 24 awards selected by three judges each year. The 2013 parade float judges were esteemed floral designer Shane Connolly, Macy's marketing executive and event producer Amy Kule, and Brian Sullivan, an executive with Southern California's Descanso Gardens. Since Honda became the title sponsor, its floats are not eligible to compete for an award.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>After the parade the floats are parked at the end of the parade route on Sierra Madre Boulevard and Washington Boulevard, near Victory Park and are on display for a day and a half (two-and-a-half days when January 1 falls on Friday) after the parade. None of the float riders or dignitaries/celebrities involved in the parade are present, and animated features on some floats are not activated. Admission to the viewing area is $13 and children are admitted free.

<p>The Tournament of Roses has become such a large event that it requires 65,000 hours of combined manpower each year, or the equivalent of roughly 7.42 years of combined manpower. Fortunately for the Association, the group has 935 members, each of whom is assigned to one of 34 committees, and around 50 student ambassadors. Responsibilities include:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p>
<ul><li>Selecting Parade participants</li>
<li>Inspecting and testing floats for safe and reliable operation</li>
<li>Assembling the parade elements</li>
<li>Conducting the parade through the streets of Pasadena</li>
<li>Directing visitors on New Year's Day</li>
<li>Assisting the public and the media in viewing the parade</li>
<li>Giving presentations about the Tournament to community groups</li>
<li>Supervising elements of the Rose Bowl Game (and also the BCS National Championship Game when held in Pasadena)</li></ul>
<p>During the Parade, many Tournament members are required to wear white suits with red ties, name tags, membership pins and official ribbons. Because of this, the volunteers are commonly referred to as "White Suiters." In December each year, a fleet of white vehicles with special "ToR" license plates are seen throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The use of these cars is currently donated by American Honda for use by high-ranking Tournament members.

<p>Each year, an honor troop of Eagle Scouts from the San Gabriel Valley Council, (now GLAAC), and "The Tournament Troop" of Girl Scout Gold Award recipients of the Arcadia Service Unit of the Girl Scouts Greater Los Angeles, is selected to carry the parade banners down the route. Each year, for the last 35 years, more than 100 scouts have participated.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>The <i>Tournament of Roses Radio Amateurs</i> (TORRA) provided audio communications and video co-ordination for the parade officials through the use of Amateur radio from 1968 until 2005. With over 300 ham radio operators in TORRA there were several ham radio sites along the parade route equipped with amateur television as well as 2-way ham radios. Several mobile units â€“ including motorcycles and pedestrian units (creepie-peepies) provided the video coverage. With modern technology and cell phone service, TORRA was no longer needed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>Thousands more volunteers help cover the floats in those beautiful flower and seed mixes during "Deco week," Dec 26- parade day. Many of these come back year after year, some even camp nearby to help all week long.

<p>For the 2006 Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2 (it is always held on January 2 when January 1 falls on a Sunday) winds with gusts up to 45Â mph (72Â km/h) and five inches (130 mm) of rain in the Pasadena area were predicted. The forecast proved accurate, ruining the 51 year record of good weather for the parade. It rained continuously and heavily throughout the entire 2006 parade. The President of the Tournament, the Grand Marshal of the Parade and the executive committee, deliberated into the early morning at the Tournament House. With street rumors circulating of the parade being canceled or postponed and restlessness of the crowd further east along the parade route, the parade got underway despite the bleak weather. Low television ratings and poor attendance plagued the ceremony. Some floats sustained water damage by the end of the parade.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notes">Notes</span></h2>
<ul><li>January 2, 1922 â€“ First parade not held on New Year's Day (The parade is traditionally never held on a Sunday because when it was first started the Tournament did not want the horses to get spooked by the church bells)</li>
<li>January 3, 2002 â€“ Tournament of Roses hosted the first BCS National Championship where Miami defeated Nebraska, 37-14, and the Parade and the Rose Bowl Game were held on separate days</li>
<li>The animated 2007 movie "The Bee Movie" featured the Tournament of Roses</li>
<li>January 1, 2014 â€“ The first same-sex marriage at the parade was held, for Aubrey Loots and Danny LeClair.</li>
<li>January 1, 2019 - The parade was delayed near the end of the two-hour broadcast by NBC and ABC when the float commemorating the 150th anniversary of the First Transcontinental Railroad with the placing of the Golden Spike, entitled  "Harmony Through Union", suffered a minor fire and blocked the parade route. The volunteers on board were able to evacuate safely, and the float was secured by LASD deputies and Pasadena police until it could be moved to allow the parade to resume, being able to still finish the parade while being towed.</li></ul>
