<p><b>Human sexual activity</b>, <b>human sexual practice</b> or <b>human sexual behaviour</b> is the manner in which humans experience and express their sexuality</a>. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., masturbation</a>) to acts with another person (e.g., sexual intercourse</a>, non-penetrative sex</a>, oral sex</a>, etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in sexual arousal</a> and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the sex life</a> of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners (courtship</a> and display</a> behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, foreplay</a> or BDSM</a>). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, emotional</a>, behavioural</a> and biological aspects; these include personal bonding</a>, sharing emotions and the physiology</a> of the reproductive system</a>, sex drive</a>, sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while premarital</a> and extramarital sex</a> are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the norms</a> of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most jurisdictions</a> are sexual assault</a> and sexual activity with a person below the local age of consent</a>.

<p>Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called autoeroticism</a>) such as masturbation</a>, or two or more people such as vaginal sex</a>, anal sex</a>, oral sex</a> or mutual masturbation</a>. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as group sex</a>. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of dildos</a>, vibrators</a>, anal beads</a>, and other sex toys</a>, though these devices can also be used with a partner.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Sexual activity can be classified into the gender</a> and sexual orientation</a> of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners</a>, casual sex partners</a> or anonymous</a>. Sexual activity can be regarded as conventional</a> or as alternative</a>, involving, for example, fetishism</a>, paraphilia</a>, or BDSM</a> activities.<sup id="cite_ref-channel1_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-findarticles.com_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation</a> and self-bondage</a>. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking</a> and bondage</a>, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called sexual assault</a> or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to social norms</a> or generally accepted sexual morals</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mating_strategies">Mating strategies</span></h2>
<p>In evolutionary psychology</a> and behavioral ecology</a>, human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain mates</a>. Mating strategies overlap with reproductive</a> strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see life history theory</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of marriage</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term intimate relationship</a>, marriage, casual relationship</a>, or friendship</a>. The human desire for companionship</a> is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the sex drive</a>. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the courtship</a> process and the process of forming an interpersonal relationship</a>. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see animal sexual behavior</a>).

<p>The physiological responses</a> during sexual stimulation</a> are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.<sup id="cite_ref-Schacter_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<ul><li>During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a "sex flush</a>" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's vagina</a> becomes lubricated and her clitoris</a> becomes swollen.<sup id="cite_ref-Schacter_4-1" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> A male's penis will become erect.</li>
<li>During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with semen</a>.

<li>During the orgasm</a> phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having faked it</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Schacter_4-3" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.<sup id="cite_ref-Schacter_4-4" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period</a> and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first,<sup id="cite_ref-Rosenthal_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SOC_6-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.<sup id="cite_ref-Schacter_4-5" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weiner_&amp;_Craighead_7-0" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> This period may last from minutes to days and is typically longer for men than women.<sup id="cite_ref-Schacter_4-6" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Sexual dysfunction</a> is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> In the media, sexual dysfunction is often associated with men, but in actuality, it is more commonly observed in females (43 percent) than males (31 percent).<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">"Pity sex" redirects here. For the American rock band, see Pity Sex</a>.</div>
<p>People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: <i>physical attraction</i>, as a <i>means to an end</i>, to increase <i>emotional connection</i>, and to <i>alleviate insecurity</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the arousal of their sexuality</a>, especially if they can achieve orgasm</a>. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from foreplay</a> and flirting, and from fetish</a> or BDSM activities,<sup id="cite_ref-channel1_1-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> or other erotic activities</a>. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the sexual desire</a> generated by a person to whom they feel sexual attraction</a>; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of casual or social sex</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of conception</a>. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten sexual tension</a>, attraction and interest.<sup id="cite_ref-Holbrook1972_13-0" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. Joan Roughgarden</a>, in her book <i>Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,</i> postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.<sup id="cite_ref-Roughgarden2004_14-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Self-determination_theory">Self-determination theory</span></h3>
<p>Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with self-determination theory</a>. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation.

<p>The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See Prevalence of virginity</a>.) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the sexualization</a> of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of virginity</a> or innocence.

<p>Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on social policy</a>, marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. Sodomy laws</a> were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing sexual abuse</a>, committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent</a>, performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Different-sex sexual practices may be monogamous</a>, serially monogamous, or polyamorous</a>, and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, abstinent</a> or autoerotic</a> (including masturbation</a>). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

<p>Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.<sup id="cite_ref-APAHelp_36-0" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.<sup id="cite_ref-WhatIsNature_37-0" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being closeted</a> (hiding their sexuality in "the closet"). "Closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called "coming out of the closet</a>" in the case of voluntary disclosure or "outing</a>" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "down-low</a>"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. Men who have sex with men</a>, as well as women who have sex with women</a>, or men on the "down-low" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as situational homosexuality</a>). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their sexual identity</a>. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&#160;– tribadism</a> (generally vulva</a>-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its "scissoring" position) and frot</a> (generally penis</a>-to-penis rubbing).

For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed moral codes</a> covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of extramarital sexual relations</a>, it has always been widely practiced.

<p>BDSM is a variety of erotic</a> practices or roleplaying</a> involving bondage</a>, dominance and submission</a>, sadomasochism</a>, and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on self-identification</a> and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers</a>, extreme body modification</a> enthusiasts, animal players</a>, latex or rubber aficionados</a>, and others.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline.

They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. Their findings suggest that submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun.

<p>There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called sexual assault</a>, and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex (age of consent</a>) are frequently the subject of debate, as is adolescent sexual behavior</a> in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.
