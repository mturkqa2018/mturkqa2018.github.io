<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The entire Suwa shrine complex consists of four main shrines grouped into two sites: the Upper Shrine or <i>Kamisha</i> (ä¸Šç¤¾), comprising the <i>Maemiya</i> <span style="font-weight:normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">å‰å®®</span>, former shrine)</span> and the <i>Honmiya</i> <span style="font-weight:normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja">æœ¬å®®</span>, main shrine)</span>, and the Lower Shrine or <i>Shimosha</i> (ä¸‹ç¤¾), comprising the <i>Harumiya</i> (æ˜¥å®®, spring shrine) and the <i>Akimiya</i> (ç§‹å®®, autumn shrine). The Upper Shrine is located on the south side of Lake Suwa, in the cities of Chino and Suwa, while the Lower Shrine is on the northern side of the lake, in the town of Shimosuwa.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In addition to these four main shrines, some sixty other auxiliary shrines scattered throughout the Lake Suwa area (ranging from miniature stone structures to medium to large sized edifices and compounds) are also part of the shrine complex. These are the focus of certain rituals in the shrine's religious calendar.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Historically, the Upper and the Lower Shrines have been two separate entities, each with its own set of shrines and religious ceremonies. The existence of two main sites, each one having a system parallel to but completely different from the other, complicates a study of the Suwa belief system as a whole. One circumstance that simplifies the matter somewhat, however, is that very little documentation for the Lower Shrine has been preserved; almost all extant historical and ritual documents regarding Suwa Shrine extant today are those of the Upper Shrine.

This <i>honden</i> replaced a different structure that originally stood in the same spot.</div></div></div><p> The god of the Upper Shrine, named Takeminakata (also 'Minakatatomi' or 'Takeminakatatomi') in the imperially-commissioned official histories, is also often popularly referred to as Suwa (Dai)myÅjin. The goddess of the Lower Shrine, held to be this god's consort, is given the name Yasakatome in these records.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Although these are the official identities of the shrine's gods, most of its rituals are actually not so much concerned with their identities but with their character as Mishaguji, local agricultural and fertility deities. The name 'Takeminakata' in fact does not appear in historical records of the Upper Shrine's religious rites; rather, the focus of worship in these rituals are often identified as the Mishaguji.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>While both the <i>Kojiki</i> (720 CE) and the <i>Sendai Kuji Hongi</i> (807-936 CE) portray Takeminakata as a son of ÅŒkuninushi, the god of Izumo Province, who was driven into exile in Suwa after his shameful defeat in the hands of a messenger sent by the gods of heaven, other myths portray the Suwa deity differently: in one story, for instance, the god is an immigrant who conquered the region by defeating various local deities who resisted him. In a medieval Buddhist legend, Suwa MyÅjin was a king from India whose feats included quelling a rebellion in his kingdom and defeating a dragon in Persia before manifesting in Japan as a native <i>kami</i>. In another medieval folk story, the god was a warrior named KÅga SaburÅ who returned from a journey into the underworld only to find himself transformed into a serpent or dragon. A fourth myth portrays the Suwa deity as an entity without a physical form who then chose an eight-year old boy to become his priest and physical 'body'.

Instead, the Upper Shrine's objects of worship were the sacred mountain behind the <i>Kamisha Honmiya</i>, a sacred rock (ç£åº§ <i>iwakura</i>) upon which Suwa MyÅjin was thought to descend, and the shrine's former high priest or <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, who was considered to be the physical incarnation of the god himself. This was later joined by Buddhist structures (removed or demolished during the Meiji period) which were also revered as symbols of the deity.

<p>The Suwa region during the late Yayoi period was thought to have been originally populated by autonomous village communities, which were eventually united under a single priest-chieftain who governed the local religious practices centered around the worship of nature spirits known as the Mishaguji, gods of fertility and agriculture who were also considered to be guardians of local communities. These communities were eventually subsumed into the expanding Yamato state around the 6th to 7th centuries; the appearance of burial mounds markedly different from the type heretofore common in the region are taken to be signs of the Lake Suwa area coming under Yamato rule.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Local historians have seen the myths that speak of Suwa MyÅjin's conquest of the area to reflect power struggles and changing alliances in the 7th and 8th centuries, after the establishment of the <i>ritsuryÅ</i> government. The god of Suwa's mythic victory over the god Moreya, for instance, is considered to reflect the historical usurpation of control over the regional deity by an immigrant clan known as the Kanesashi (é‡‘åˆº, also read as 'Kanasashi'), which as district magistrates (éƒ¡é ˜ <i>gunryÅ</i>) were in charge of producing and collecting taxed goods and laborers to be sent to the central government in Yamato Province. The Kanesashi's seat of power seems to have been located north of Lake Suwa, near what is now the Lower Shrine, although there was not yet a shrine there at the time. This location was closer to the important crossroads that led to the capital.

<p>According to a genealogical list of the Aso clan (purportedly related to the Kanesashi) of Aso Shrine in Kyushu, the <i>Aso-ke Ryaku Keizu</i> (é˜¿è˜‡å®¶ç•¥ç³»å›³), a man named Otoei (ä¹™é ´) or Kumako (ç¥žå­ or ç†Šå¤), son of the Kanesashi clan leader and <i>kuni no miyatsuko</i> Mase-gimi (éº»èƒŒå›) - identified here as the legendary high priest (<i>ÅŒhÅri</i>) chosen by the Suwa deity to become his 'body' - founded "a shrine ... at the foot of the mountain" to the god in "the second year of Iware Ikenobe no ÅŒmiya" (587 CE), what would eventually be known as the Upper Shrine. While the historical reliability of this genealogy has been called into question, it nevertheless shows the importance of the Kanesashi in garnering official recognition for what had once been a local cult and the founding of the shrines.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The office of <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, a boy priest-shaman revered as deity incarnate, might have been originally instituted as a way to absorb native religious practices into the Yamato belief system. The local line of priest-chiefs whose religious authority was usurped by the Kanesashi, what would later become known as the Moriya (å®ˆçŸ¢) clan, was integrated into the new system as the <i>JinchÅkan</i>, the priest who had the prerogative to summon the Mishaguji in rituals. The Moriya's submission to and cooperation with the new system enabled the local Mishaguji cult to survive underneath it: while officially subservient to the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, in reality the <i>JinchÅkan</i>, who presided over all the shrine ceremonies, continued to wield authority while the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> was but a symbolic presence. In fact, the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, the new god to be worshipped, can only become a living deity by being made to be possessed by the Mishaguji by the <i>JinchÅkan</i>, the representative of those who worship the old god.

This record testifies to the worship of the Suwa deity (embodied by the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>) as a water and/or wind deity during the late 7th century, on par with the wind gods of Tatsuta in Yamato Province (modern Nara Prefecture).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>'Takeminakata', the name by which Suwa MyÅjin is more commonly known to the imperial court, appears in the historical record for the first time in the <i>Kojiki</i>'s (711-712 CE) <i>kuni-yuzuri</i> myth cycle. Although the work portrays Takeminakata as a god hailing from Izumo Province, references to such a deity are curiously absent from the <i>Nihon Shoki</i> or other sources dealing with the province. Due to this silence, it is thought that the god might have been interpolated by the <i>Kojiki</i>'s chief compiler, ÅŒ no Yasumaro, into a story which did not originally feature him. Scholars believe various factors were at play for Takeminakata's introduction in the <i>Kojiki</i>'s narrative - one being that Yasumaro's clan, the ÅŒ, were distantly related to the Kanesashi. Takeminakata's inclusion in the <i>Kojiki</i> might have thus been a means to promote the Kanesashi's local cult and ensure its rise in prominence.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>As the Kanesashi, a clan of provincial (and thus 'inferior') origins, rose in rank, so too did their deities rise up in rank. The national histories record Takeminakata's exceptionally rapid rise in importance: from rankless (æ— ä½), the imperial court steadily promoted the deity to increasingly higher ranks within the space of twenty-five years, beginning with junior fifth, upper grade (å¾“äº”ä½ä¸Š) in 842 CE.) By 867 CE, 'Takeminakatatomi-no-Mikoto' is recorded in the <i>Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</i> as being elevated to the rank of junior first (å¾“ä¸€ä½).

<p>The Aso clan genealogy relates that Otoei's brother, Kuratari (å€‰è¶³), was the district magistrate (è©•ç£ <i>hyÅtoku</i> or <i>koori no kami</i>) of Suwa. His immediate descendants, who bore the Kanesashi name, are in turn also recorded as administrative heads (<i>gunryÅ</i>) of Suwa district.

A genealogy of the Lower Shrine's high priestly line records an elder brother of his, Masanaga (æ­£é•·), who in addition to being the district governor (å¤§é ˜ <i>dairyÅ</i>) of Hanishina District, also held the title of <i>MegamihÅri</i> (å£²ç¥žç¥) or 'priest of the goddess'. The same title appears in a seal in the Lower Shrine's possession (designed as an Important Cultural Property in 1934) traditionally said to have been bequeathed by the Emperor Heizei (reigned 806-809).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>References to other members of the Kanesashi rising to positions of prominence during the 8th to 9th centuries are found in the official histories. A Kanesashi from Ina District, Hachimaro (å…«éº»å‘‚), was given the rank of outer junior fifth, lower grade (å¤–å¾“äº”ä½ä¸‹) by the court for quelling rebellion after the death of Fujiwara no Nakamaro in 764 CE - the 'outer' indicating his origins from a provincial clan. A female clan member from Minochi (encompassing the modern districts of Kamiminochi and Shimominochi and part of Nagano, Iiyama, and Nakano), Kanesashi no Wakashima (é‡‘åˆºè‹¥å¶‹), was granted the same title in 770 CE, with 'outer' being removed from her title in 777 CE upon the clan's gaining status as an aristocracy.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Scholars believe that the Lower Shrine and its goddess - named 'Yasakatome' in imperial histories - was created by the Kanesashi as a way to receive higher appointments in rank from the court, in competition with the Moriya family who were the Upper Shrine's priests. The Lower Shrine may have started as a kind of ancestral shrine to the clan's forebears, with its female god meant to deliberately contrast with the Upper Shrine's male deity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>As Takeminakata, the Upper Shrine's god, rose up in rank, so did Yasakatome, so that by 867 CE, the goddess had been promoted to senior second rank (æ­£äºŒä½).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heian_and_Kamakura_periods">Heian and Kamakura periods</span></h3>
<p>While two genealogical lists of disputed historical value, of which the aforementioned Aso clan genealogy is one, identify Otoei/Kumako as the first priest of Suwa MyÅjin, traditionally this priest is instead believed to be Arikazu (æœ‰å“¡), who is thought to have lived during the early 9th century, somewhere during the reigns of emperors Kanmu (781-806), Heizei (806-809) or Saga (809-823). Some sources in fact go so far as to claim (without historical basis) that Arikazu was a son of Kanmu and an imperial prince. Nevertheless, a possible connection between Arikazu and the imperial court does exist that might have engendered this belief: a medieval legend relates that the Suwa deity appeared to the 8th century general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro during his campaign to subjugate the Emishi of northeastern Japan; in thanksgiving for the god's assistance, Tamuramaro was said to have petitioned the court for the institution of the shrine's religious festivals. Scholars have thought that this story might be ultimately based on Arikazu (who, as <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, was the deity himself in bodily form) ingratiating himself with the imperial court, perhaps to make up for his shrine having had little contact with the central government compared with the Kanesashi family in the north. Thanks to his connections with Tamuramaro and the court, Arikazu exerted great influence such that later tradition came to identify him with the mythical first <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> and progenitor of the Upper Shrine's high priestly line.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>By the late Heian period, Suwa became considered as Shinano's chief shrine or <i>ichinomiya</i>. with literary mentions attesting to its status. The 'Register of Deities' (ç¥žåå¸³ <i>JinmyÅchÅ</i>) section of the <i>Engishiki</i> (927 CE) lists the 'Minakatatomi Shrines' (å—æ–¹åˆ€ç¾Žç¥žç¤¾) as the two major ('eminent') shrines of Suwa district. 'Suwa Shrine of Shinano' is mentioned briefly in Minamoto no Tsuneyori (976/985-1039) diary, the <i>Sakeiki</i> (å·¦çµŒè¨˜) as the representative shrine for Shinano Province when Emperor Go-IchijÅ sent an envoy to shrines in every province in the country in 1017 CE. The <i>RyÅjin HishÅ</i>, an anthology of songs compiled in 1179, names the shrine of Suwa among famous shrines to martial deities in the eastern half of the country.

<p>As Buddhism began to penetrate Suwa and syncretize with local beliefs, the deities of the Upper and Lower Shrines came to be identified with the bodhisattvas Samantabhadra (Fugen) and AvalokiteÅ›vara (Kannon), respectively. Buddhist temples and other edifices (most of which belonged to the esoteric Shingon school) were erected on the precincts of both shrines, such as a sanctuary to Samantabhadra known as the <i>FugendÅ</i> (æ™®è³¢å ‚) and a stone pagoda symbolizing the legendary iron tower in India where, according to Shingon tradition, Nagarjuna was said to have received esoteric teachings from Vajrasattva (considered to be an aspect of Samantabhadra) called the <i>TettÅ</i> (é‰„å¡” "iron tower"). For a long time, these two structures were considered as the Upper Shrine's objects of worship. As Buddhist ethics, which opposed the taking of life and Mahayana's strict views on vegetarianism somewhat conflicted with Suwa MyÅjin's status as a god of hunting, the Suwa cult devised elaborate theories that legitimized the hunting, eating, and sacrifice of animals such as deer (a beast sacred to the god) within a Buddhist framework. The shrines produced special talismans (é¹¿é£Ÿå… <i>kajikimen</i> "permit to eat venison") and chopsticks (é¹¿é£Ÿç®¸ <i>kajikibashi</i>) that were held to allow the bearer to eat meat.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>A significant change in the Suwa cult in the medieval period was its association with samurai culture. The prominence of hunting in the shrine's religious rites undoubtedly caught the attention of warriors. Devotion to Suwa MyÅjin (especially as god of war) became more widespread thanks in part to the rise of the Upper Shrine's high priestly family - now calling themselves the Jin/Miwa (ç¥ž) or the Suwa (è«è¨ª) - as vassals (<i>gokenin</i>) of the Kamakura shogunate and the HÅjÅ clan. The shrines of Suwa and the priestly clans thereof flourished under the patronage of the HÅjÅ, which promoted devotion to the god as a sign of loyalty to the shogunate. The religious festivals of the Upper and Lower Shrines attracted many of the samurai caste as well as other social classes, both from within Shinano and outside. The HÅjÅ appointed local land managers (<i>jitÅ</i>) and retainers, who were sometimes HÅjÅ family members, as sponsors (å¾¡é ­ <i>otÅ</i> or <i>ontÅ</i>) of the festivals, which helped provide financial support for the shrines. To offset the burden of this service, these sponsors enjoyed a number of benefits such as exemption from certain provincial taxes and the right to be pardoned for crimes during their year of service as <i>otÅ</i>.

<p>Around this time, Suwa branch shrines became numerous all across Japan, especially in territories held by clans devoted to the god (for instance, the KantÅ region, traditional stronghold of the Minamoto (Seiwa Genji) clan). A number of factors were instrumental for this spread of the Suwa MyÅjin cult. First, warriors from Shinano Province who were rewarded lands in the western provinces by the shogunate in the aftermath of the JÅkyÅ« War of 1221 took the Suwa cult with them. Second, the shogunate appointed major non-Shinano vassals to manors in the province, who then acted as sponsors and participants in the shrine rituals, eventually installing the cult in their native areas. A third factor was the exemption granted to the shrines of Suwa from the ban on falconry (<i>takagari</i>) - a favorite sport of the upper classes - imposed by the shogunate in 1212, due to the importance of hunting in its rites. As a loophole to this ban, the <i>gokenin</i> built Suwa branch shrines in their own provinces where 'Suwa style' falconry could be performed, ostensibly to collect offerings for the shrine.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>The Suwa cult was also propagated by wandering preachers (å¾¡å¸« <i>oshi</i>) who traveled around Shinano and neighboring provinces, preaching stories about the Suwa deity as well as distributing <i>kajikimen</i> and <i>kajikibashi</i> to the populace, collecting offerings and donations in exchange. The Suwa <i>oshi</i> also carried with them miniature replicas of the iron bells (é‰„é¸ <i>tettaku</i>) which were used to call forth the Mishaguji in some rituals as well as seal promises and agreements in the god's name.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>In 1249, the Upper Shrine's <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, Suwa Nobushige (è«è¨ªä¿¡é‡), sent an appeal (è§£çŠ¶ <i>gejÅ</i>) to the shogunate after becoming embroiled in a dispute with Kanesashi Morimoto (é‡‘åˆºç››åŸº), the high priest of the Lower Shrine, as to which of their shrines was the real main shrine of Suwa and thus, is to set a precedent in religious rites. In the petition, Nobushige argued for the antiquity and supremacy of the Upper Shrine <i>contra</i> the Lower Shrine's charges by recounting its origin myths and its ceremonies. Nobushige's appeal is thus an invaluable document for understanding Suwa Shrine's customs and traditions during the early Kamakura period.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muromachi_and_Sengoku_periods">Muromachi and Sengoku periods</span></h3>
<p>The shrines suffered a heavy setback at the downfall of the HÅjÅ and the collapse of the shogunate in 1333. Testifying to the close connections between the warrior families of the Suwa region and the HÅjÅ is the fact that many members of the Suwa clan present in Kamakura during the siege of the city in 1333 committed suicide alongside HÅjÅ Takatoki.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Takatoki's son, the young Tokiyuki, sought refuge in Shinano with Suwa Yorishige (è«è¨ªé ¼é‡, not to be confused with the Sengoku period <i>daimyÅ</i> of the same name) and his son and then-<i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, Tokitsugu (æ™‚ç¶™). In Julyâ€“August 1335, the Suwa and other clans who remained loyal to the HÅjÅ, led by Tokiyuki, instigated an unsuccessful armed rebellion with the intention of reestablishing the Kamakura shogunate, which ended with the defeat of Tokiyuki's forces and Yorishige, Tokitsugu and some others committing suicide. Tokitsugu's son who inherited the priesthood, Yoritsugu (é ¼ç¶™), was stripped from his position and replaced by Fujisawa Masayori (è—¤æ²¢æ”¿é ¼), who hailed from a cadet branch of the clan. Now declared an enemy of the imperial throne, Yoritsugu went into hiding.

<p>It is believed that the story of KÅga SaburÅ, which portrays Suwa MyÅjin as a warrior hero and a hunter, originated in the aftermath of the shogunate's collapse and the Suwa <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>'s status becoming diminished as a result. Whereas formerly, the Suwa clan relied on the doctrine of the Upper Shrine's high priest being a god in the flesh to exert authority over its warrior devotees (Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1186 chastised subordinates for not obeying the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, declaring that his words are those of the god of Suwa himself), with the loss of official backing the Suwa shrine network became decentralized. Warriors who were devoted to the Suwa cult sought for stories (<i>setsuwa</i>) about the deity that did not involve the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> or the Suwa clan, leading to the rise of localized <i>setsuwa</i> such as the KÅga SaburÅ legend.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Suwa (or Kosaka) EnchÅ«, government official and member of a cadet branch of the Suwa, took it upon himself to revive the former status of Suwa Shrine. To this end, he commissioned a set of ten illustrated scrolls (later expanded to twelve) showcasing the shrine's history and its various religious ceremonies, which was completed in 1356. The actual scrolls were later lost, but its text portions were copied and widely circulated, becoming known as the <i>Suwa DaimyÅjin Ekotoba</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>By the 14th century, the high priestly houses of the Upper and Lower Shrines, the Suwa and the Kanesashi were at war with each other and, in the Suwa's case, among themselves. During the Nanboku-chÅ period, the Suwa supported the Southern Court, while the Kanesashi chose to side with the Northern Court. This and other reasons contributed to the state of war between the two families, as well as other clans allied with them, during the Muromachi and Sengoku periods. During a battle between the two factions in 1483, the Lower Shrines were burned down by the Upper Shrine's forces; its high priest, Kanesashi Okiharu (é‡‘åˆºèˆˆæ˜¥), was killed in battle.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>In 1535, Takeda Nobutora of Kai Province, who fought against the Suwa clan a number of times, had a truce with clan leader Suwa Yorishige and sent his daughter Nene off to him as his wife. His clan, the Takeda, were already known to be devotees of the Suwa deity since the 12th century, when in 1140, Takeda Nobuyoshi donated lands to each of the two shrines of Suwa in thanksgiving for his defeat of the Taira. By marrying his daughter to Yorishige, Nobutora was trying to bring himself closer to the Suwa and thus, ensuring that he would receive the blessings of the god.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>In 1542, Nobutora's son Shingen invaded Shinano and defeated Yorishige in a series of sieges; two years later Yorishige was forced to commit seppuku. Shingen then took Yorishige's daughter (his niece) to be one of his wives and had a son with her, Katsuyori, who would eventually prove to be the downfall of the Takeda. Shingen notably did not give his son the character traditionally used in Takeda names, ä¿¡ (<i>nobu</i>), but instead the character é ¼ (<i>yori</i>) used for the names of Suwa clan members, apparently as a sign of Katsuyori being the intended heir to the Suwa legacy and of Shingen's desire to place the land of Suwa and its shrines under Takeda control.

<p>After Yorishige's downfall, Suwa was divided between the Takeda and their ally, TakatÅ Yoritsugu (é«˜é é ¼ç¶™), who coveted the position of <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>. When he did not receive the priestly office, Yoritsugu invaded the other half of the territory that was in Takeda hands. Ensuring that Yoritsugu will not receive support from the former Suwa retainers, Shingen made Yorishige's son the nominal leader of the forces of resistance and retaliated by capturing Yoritsugu's castles. Shingen is said to have prayed at the Upper Shrine for victory, vowing to donate a horse and a set of armor should he defeat Yoritsugu. His making Yorishige's son the nominal head of his troops is also believed to be a way to invoke the aid of the Suwa deity. Apart from this, there are other recorded instances of Shingen praying to the god to assist him in his campaigns.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>From 1565 onwards, Shingen (who by now had conquered the whole of Shinano Province) issued orders for the revival of religious rituals in the Upper and Lower Shrines which were discontinued due to the chaos of war and lack of financial support, which also helped him both strengthen his control over Shinano and unify the people of the province.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Shingen's devotion to Suwa MyÅjin is also evident in some of his war banners, which bore the god's syncretized Buddhist name: <i>Suwa NangÅ« HosshÅ Kamishimo DaimyÅjin</i> (è«æ–¹å—å®®æ³•æ€§ä¸Šä¸‹å¤§æ˜Žç¥ž 'Dharma-Nature <i>DaimyÅjin</i> of the Suwa Upper and Lower Southern Shrines'), as well as his iconic helmet, the Suwa HosshÅ helmet (è«è¨ªæ³•æ€§å…œ).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>In 1582, the eldest son of Oda Nobunaga, Nobutada, led an army into Takeda-controlled Shinano and burned the Upper Shrine to the ground. The shrine was subsequently rebuilt two years later.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>The period saw escalating tensions between the priests and the shrine monks (<i>shasÅ</i>) of the Suwa complex, with increasing attempts from the priesthood to distance themselves from the Buddhist temples. By the end of the Edo period, the priests, deeply influenced by Hirata Atsutane's nativist, anti-Buddhist teachings, became extremely antagonistic towards the shrine temples and their monks. In 1864 and 1867, Buddhist structures in the Lower Shrine were set on fire by unknown perpetrators; in the latter case, it was rumored to have been caused by the shrine's priests.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>The establishment of State Shinto after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 brought an end to the union between Shinto and Buddhism. The shrines of Suwa, due to their prominent status as <i>ichinomiya</i> of Shinano, were chosen as one of the primary targets for the edict of separation, which took effect swiftly and thoroughly. The shrine monks were laicized and Buddhist symbols either removed from the complex or destroyed; the shrines' Buddhist rites, such as the yearly offering of the Lotus Sutra to Suwa MyÅjin (involving the placing of a copy of the sutra inside the <i>TettÅ</i>), were discontinued. The now laicized monks at first tried to continue serving at the shrines as Shinto priests; however, due to continued discrimination from the shrine priesthood, they gave up and left. The priests themselves were soon ousted from their offices as the state abolished hereditary succession among Shinto priests and private ownership of shrines across the country; the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> - now stripped of his divine status - as well as the other local priestly houses were replaced by government-appointed priests.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>In 1871, the Upper and Lower Shrines - now under government control - were merged into a single institution, Suwa Shrine (è«è¨ªç¥žç¤¾ <i>Suwa Jinja</i>), and received the rank of <i>kokuhei-chÅ«sha</i> (å›½å¹£ä¸­ç¤¾), before being promoted to <i>kanpei-chÅ«sha</i> (å®˜å¹£ä¸­ç¤¾) in 1896 and finally, to the highest rank of <i>kanpei-taisha</i> (å®˜å¹£å¤§ç¤¾) in 1916. After World War II, the shrine was listed as a special-class shrine (åˆ¥è¡¨ç¥žç¤¾ <i>beppyÅ-jinja</i>) by the Association of Shinto Shrines and renamed Suwa Grand Shrine (<i>Suwa Taisha</i>) in 1948.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kamisha_Maemiya"><i>Kamisha Maemiya</i></span></h4>
<p>The <i>Maemiya</i> (å‰å®® 'former shrine'), as its name implies, is thought to be the oldest site in the Upper Shrine complex and the center of its religious rites. Originally one of the chief auxiliary shrines of the Upper Shrine complex (see below), the <i>Maemiya</i> was elevated to its current status as one of its two main shrines in 1896 (Meiji 29).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>While Yasakatome, Suwa MyÅjin's consort, is often currently identified as this shrine's deity (with popular legend claiming that the burial mounds of Takeminakata and Yasakatome are to be found in this shrine), medieval records instead associate the <i>Maemiya</i> with the local fertility and agriculture god(s) known as Mishaguji, who occupy a prominent role in the religious rituals held here. The <i>Maemiya</i> is thus more likely to have been originally a place where the 'former' <i>kami</i> of the region, the Mishaguji, were worshipped.

<p>During the Middle Ages, the area around the <i>Maemiya</i> was known as the <i>GÅbara</i> (ç¥žåŽŸ), the 'Field of the Deity', as it was the residence of the Upper Shrine's high priest, the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>, considered to be the god of Suwa incarnate, and was the site of many important rituals. The <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>'s original residence in the <i>GÅbara</i>, the <i>GÅdono</i> (ç¥žæ®¿), also functioned as the political center of the region, with a small town (<i>monzen-machi</i>) developing around it. The <i>GÅdono</i> was eventually abandoned after the area was deemed to have become ritually polluted in the aftermath of the intraclan conflict among the Suwa clan which resulted in the death of <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> Suwa Yorimitsu (è«è¨ªé ¼æº€) in 1483. In 1601, the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i>'s place of residence was moved from the <i>Maemiya</i> to Miyatado (å®®ç”°æ¸¡) in modern Suwa City.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>With the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> having moved elsewhere, the <i>GÅbara</i> fell into decline during the Edo period as locals began to build houses in the precincts and convert much of it into rice fields; even the shrine priests who still lived nearby used the land for rice farming to support themselves.

<dl><dd>The shrine's current <i>honden</i> was originally built in 1932 with materials formerly used in the Grand Shrine of Ise, replacing a wooden shed that formerly stood on the exact same spot known as the 'purification hut' (ç²¾é€²å±‹ <i>shÅjin-ya</i>). This hut was built atop a large sacred rock known as the <i>Gorei'i-iwa</i> (å¾¡éœŠä½ç£), upon which the <i>ÅŒhÅri</i> engaged in a thirty-day period of strict austerities in preparation for becoming a vessel of the deity. After being dismantled, the <i>shÅjin-ya</i> was eventually rebuilt in what is now a district of modern Chino City and repurposed as a local shrine. Immediately by the <i>honden</i> and the rock below it is the supposed burial mound of Takeminakata and/or Yasakatome.</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The high priest of the <i>Kamisha</i>, considered to be an <i>arahitogami</i>, a living embodiment of Suwa MyÅjin, and thus, an object of worship. The Suwa were in legend considered to be Suwa MyÅjin's descendants, although historically they are probably descended from the same family as the Kanasashi of the <i>Shimosha</i>: that of the <i>kuni-no-miyatsuko</i> of Shinano, governors appointed by the Yamato state to the province.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The head of the five assistant priests (äº”å®˜ <i>gogan</i>) serving the <i>ÅhÅri</i> and overseer of the <i>Kamisha</i>'s religious rites, considered to be descended from the god Moreya, who in myth originally resisted Suwa MyÅjin's entry into the region before becoming his priest and collaborator. While officially subservient to the <i>ÅhÅri</i>, the Moriya <i>iinchÅkan</i> was in reality the one who controlled the shrine's affairs, due to his full knowledge of its ceremonies and other rituals (which were transferred only to the heir to the position) and his exclusive ability to summon (as well as dismiss) the god(s) Mishaguji, worshipped by the Moriya since antiquity.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
