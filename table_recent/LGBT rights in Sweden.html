<p><b>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender</b> (<b>LGBT</b>) <b>rights</b> in <b>Sweden</b> have been regarded as some of the most progressive in Europe and in the world. Same-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1944 and the age of consent was equalized in 1972. Homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in 1979. Sweden also became the first country in the world to allow transgender persons to change their legal gender post-sex reassignment surgery in 1972 whilst transvestism was declassified as an illness. Transgenderism was declassified as a mental illness in 2017, and legislation allowing gender change legally without hormone replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgery was passed in 2013. After allowing same-sex couples to register for partnership benefits in 1995, Sweden became the seventh country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage countrywide in 2009. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression has been banned since 1987. Also, since 2003, gay and lesbian couples can adopt children, and lesbian couples have had equal access to IVF and assisted insemination since 2005. Sweden has been recognized as one of the most socially liberal countries in Europe and in the world, with recent polls indicating that a large majority of Swedes support LGBT rights and same-sex marriage.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Law_regarding_same-sex_sexual_activity">Law regarding same-sex sexual activity</span></h2>
<p>Sweden legalised same-sex sexual activity in 1944; in that year the age of consent became 18. In 1987, in order to combat the spread of HIV, the Legislature passed a law against sex in gay saunas and against prostitution. It was repealed in 2004. In 1972, Sweden became the first country in the world to allow transgender people to legally change their sex, provided free hormone therapy, and an equal age of consent was set at 15. This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the National Board of Health and Welfare. In October 1979, Sweden joined the few other countries in the world at the time to declassify homosexuality as an illness. Transgenderism was declassified as an illness in 2017.

<p>Same-sex couples in Sweden had the right to register their partnerships from 1995 onwards. These partnerships had all the rights of marriages except "as provided by sections 3–4" of the law. As well, all provisions of a statute or any other legislation related to marriage or spouses apply to registered partnerships and partners, except as under sections 3–4.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>As of  May 2009, new registered partnerships can no longer be entered into due to the legalization of same-sex marriage. The status of existing partnerships remains unaltered, except that they can be changed to marriage status under the law if desired.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adoption_and_family_planning">Adoption and family planning</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: LGBT parenting</div>
<p>Since 1 February 2003, LGBT people in a registered partnership/marriage have had the same Swedish adoption rights as married couples (this also includes the right of single LGBT persons to adopt). With regard to foreign adoptions, the Ministry of Justice states: "As regards adoption from abroad, it is important that we are sensitive and aware that those countries with which Sweden cooperates often hold a different view on homosexual people and homosexual parenthood. Cooperation regarding intercountry adoptions must be based on trust. This means that the limitations and terms that the countries of origin lay down must be complied with."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In 2005, a new law was passed allowing lesbian couples to be treated for assisted insemination in public hospitals.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Military_service">Military service</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: Sexual orientation and military service</div>
<p>LGBT people are not banned from military service. Sweden is one of few countries worldwide to explicitly allow <i>all</i> LGBT people to serve openly in the military. Sweden was furthermore amongst the first nations in the world to allow LGBT people to serve. In fact, gay men were allowed to serve even before Sweden demedicalized homosexuality in 1979.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The Swedish Armed Forces states that it actively work for an environment where individuals do not feel it to be necessary to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2015, they launched a Pride campaign featuring a soldier in uniform with the rainbow flag badget to her arm. The text's bold letters translates to "Some things you should not have to camouflage," followed by the text "Equality is an important ingredient in a democracy." "In the military, we treat each other with respect and see our differences as a strength. We are an inclusive organisation where all who serve and contribute should feel welcomed and respected".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gender_identity_and_expression">Gender identity and expression</span></h2>
<p>The ability to legally change the gender marker in Sweden has been available since 1972, when Sweden became the first country in the world to allow transgender people to legally correct their gender. But this was only allowed if one met several criteria - one had to be a Swedish citizen and 18 years old, unmarried (having divorced if necessary), and have lived for two years as the opposite gender. The law was re-evaluated in 2007, proposing removals of the requirements to be a Swedish citizen, unmarried and sterilized, and presented to the Christian Democrat Minister for Health and Social Affairs. The Swedish Discrimination Ombudsman (DO) and the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights inquired about the future of the proposed new law. In 2013, the requirement to be sterilized before one can legally correct one's gender and the requirement to undergo sex reassignment surgery were lifted, and are no longer part of the law. Sterilization had been part of the law since 1972, and is thought to have been used on 500 transgender people.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In February 2015, the Government introduced two bills. The first one allowing legal gender change without any form of psychiatric or psychological evaluation as well as the need of a diagnosis or any kind of medical intervention. The other one allowing sex reassignment surgery if the person applying for it submits a positive opinion from a psychiatrist.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In March 2017, the Government announced it would compensate an estimated 800 transgender people who were forced to undergo sex reassignment surgery and be sterilized so as to have their sex legally reassigned. In late March 2018, the Swedish Parliament approved the move. The compensation amount is 225,000 SEK (some 21,000 euros/27,000 U.S. dollars) per person.

<p>The Constitution of Sweden bans discrimination on grounds of "sexual orientation". In 1987, discrimination against gay men, lesbians and bisexuals was included in the section of the Penal Code which deals with discrimination on grounds of race, etc. In 2008, transgender identity or expression was added to a new unified discrimination code which came into force 1 January 2009. Since 2002, the portal section of the Constitution bans discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Until 2009, the Swedish Ombudsman against Discrimination on Grounds of Sexual Orientation (<i>Ombudsmannen mot diskriminering på grund av sexuell läggning</i>), normally referred to as <b>HomO</b>, was the Swedish office of the ombudsman against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The Ombudsman against Discrimination on Grounds of Sexual Orientation ceased to exist on 1 January 2009; the Ombudsman was merged with the other Ombudsmen against discrimination into a new body: the Discrimination Ombudsman. The previously existing acts against discrimination were also replaced with a new discrimination act.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>The term HomO was used both to refer to the office and the title of its government-appointed acting head; the last HomO was Hans Ytterberg. The HomO investigated grievances of individuals and files class action suits on their behalf, for example a successful action against a restaurant owner in Stockholm who had harassed a lesbian couple. The HomO office was key in taking a number of initiatives of its own and submitting parliamentary proposals, such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>On 16 May 2018, the Swedish Parliament added "transgender identity and expression" to the country's hate crime legislation, effective 1 July 2018. Sexual orientation was added in 2010. That same day, the Parliament also added "transgender identity and expression" to the country's hate speech law, effective 1 January 2019. Sweden's hate speech law has been criticised for being "selectively applied", as the Swedish authorities refused to prosecute a Halmstad imam, who in 2015 called homosexuality a "virus". The imam, a known jihadist and supported of ISIS, was protected by the authorities. The move was condemned by the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights, which expressed fears that his views might spread to the wider Muslim community in Sweden. Mohamed Omar, a Muslim blogger, claims that homophobia in the Swedish Muslim community is tolerated by the authorities, and that the imam's views are completely mainstream within said community.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Blood_donation">Blood donation</span></h2>
<p>In the autumn of 2008, the National Board of Health and Welfare proposed that men who have sex with men (MSM) should become eligible to donate blood, but only after a six-month quarantine period after sexual intercourse. An earlier proposition in 2006 to allow MSMs to donate blood was rejected. From 1 March 2010, men who have sex with men were supposed to be allowed to donate blood, after one year of abstaining from sex, but the blood banks rejected the law, causing the law to be delayed until 1 October 2011 at the latest. This allowed them time to adapt to the new regulations. In November 2011, all blood banks in Sweden were instructed to begin accepting donations by gay and bisexual men, provided they haven't had sex in a year.

<p>According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), Sweden is one of Europe's most gay-friendly countries, with extensive legislation protecting gay and lesbian rights, including anti-discrimination law and same-sex marriage legislation. A 2006 European Union member poll showed 71% of Swedes supported same-sex marriage. The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 90% of Swedes thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 7% were against.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>In May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society’s view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Sweden was ranked fourth with a GHI score of 73.

<p>The Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights (RFSL), one of the world’s oldest LGBT organizations, originated in October 1950 as a Swedish branch of the Danish Federation of 1948. In April 1952, RFSL adopted its current name and declared itself as an independent organization. It currently has 28 branches throughout Sweden, from Piteå in the north to Malmö in the south, with over 6,000 members.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>RFSL works for LGBT people through political lobbying, the dissemination of information, and the organization of social and support activities. Internationally, RFSL works with the ILGA and also collaborates with other LGBT organizations in neighboring countries.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>The federation operates counseling centers for both women and men in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. The counseling is intended for people who need to talk about coming out, sex, HIV/AIDS and other health issues, and relationships, as well as those who need assistance in their contact with the authorities and healthcare institutions, or who require legal assistance with, for example, asylum and wills.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Several gay pride festivals are hosted in Sweden every year. Stockholm Pride is the biggest and oldest festival, and has been organized annually since 1998. In later years, pride festivals have been arranged in Gothenburg, Malmö and Uppsala, and local pride events are also hosted in smaller communities.
