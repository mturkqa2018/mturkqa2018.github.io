Located in the Diamer District of Pakistanâ€™s Gilgit Baltistan region,  Nanga Parbat is the western anchor of the Himalayas. The name Nanga Parbat is derived from the Sanskrit words <i>nagna</i> and <i>parvata</i> which together mean "Naked Mountain". The mountain is locally known by its Tibetan name <i>Diamer</i> or <i>Deo Mir</i>, meaning "huge mountain".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Nanga Parbat is one of the eight-thousanders. An immense, dramatic peak rising far above its surrounding terrain, Nanga Parbat is also a notoriously difficult climb. Numerous mountaineering deaths in the mid and early-20th century lent it the nickname "Killer Mountain.â€

<p>Nanga Parbat forms the western anchor of the Himalayan Range and is the westernmost eight-thousander. It lies just south of the Indus River in the Diamer District of Gilgitâ€“Baltistan in Pakistan. Not far to the north is the western end of the Karakoram range.

<p>Nanga Parbat has tremendous vertical relief over local terrain in all directions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>To the south, Nanga Parbat has what is often referred to as the highest mountain face in the world: the Rupal Face rises 4,600Â m (15,090Â ft) above its base. To the north, the complex, somewhat more gently sloped Rakhiot Flank rises 7,000Â m (23,000Â ft) from the Indus River valley to the summit in just 25Â km (16Â mi), one of the 10 greatest elevation gains in so short a distance on earth.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Nanga Parbat is one of only two peaks on earth that rank in the top twenty of both the highest mountains in the world, and the most prominent peaks in the world, ranking ninth and fourteenth respectively. The other is Mount Everest, which is first on both lists. It is also the second most prominent peak of the Himalayas, after Mount Everest. The key col for Nanga Parbat is Zoji La in Kashmir, which connects it to higher peaks in the remaining Himalaya-Karakoram range.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Nanga Parbat along with Namcha Barwa on the Tibetan Plateau mark the west and east ends of the Himalayas.

The southwestern portion of this main ridge is known as the Mazeno Wall, and has a number of subsidiary peaks. In the other direction, the main ridge arcs northeast at Rakhiot Peak (7,070 m / 23,196Â ft). The south/southeast side of the mountain is dominated by the Rupal Face. The north/northwest side of the mountain, leading to the Indus, is more complex. It is split into the Diamir (west) face and the Rakhiot (north) face by a long ridge. There are a number of subsidiary summits, including North Peak (7,816 m / 25,643Â ft) some 3Â km north of the main summit. Near the base of the Rupal Face is a glacial lake called Latbo, above a seasonal shepherds' village of the same name.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: 1934 Nanga Parbat climbing disaster</div>
<p>Because of its accessibility, attempts to summit Nanga Parbat began very soon after it was discovered by Europeans. In 1895 Albert F. Mummery led an expedition to the peak, and reached almost 6,100Â m (20,000Â ft) on the Diamir (West) Face, but Mummery and two Gurkha companions later died reconnoitering the Rakhiot Face.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In the 1930s, Nanga Parbat became the focus of German interest in the Himalayas. The German mountaineers were unable to attempt Mount Everest, as only the British had access to Tibet. Initially German efforts focused on Kanchenjunga, to which Paul Bauer led two expeditions in 1930 and 1931, but with its long ridges and steep faces Kanchenjunga was more difficult than Everest and neither expedition made much progress. K2 was known to be harder still, and its remoteness meant that even reaching its base would be a major undertaking. Nanga Parbat was therefore the highest mountain accessible to Germans and also deemed reasonably possible by climbers at the time.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The first German expedition to Nanga Parbat was led by Willy Merkl in 1932. It is sometimes referred to as a German-American expedition, as the eight climbers included Rand Herron, an American, and Fritz Wiessner, who would become an American citizen the following year. While the team were all strong climbers, none had Himalayan experience, and poor planning (particularly an inadequate number of porters), coupled with bad weather, prevented the team progressing far beyond the Rakhiot Peak northeast of the Nanga Parbat summit, reached by Peter Aschenbrenner and Herbert Kunigk, but they did establish the feasibility of a route via Rakhiot Peak and the main ridge.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Merkl led another expedition in 1934, which was better prepared and financed with the full backing of the new Nazi government. Early in the expedition Alfred Drexel died, probably of high altitude pulmonary edema. The Tyrolean climbers Peter Aschenbrenner and Erwin Schneider reached an estimated height of 7,900Â m (25,900Â ft) on July 6, but were forced to return because of worsening weather. On July 7 they and 14 others were trapped by a storm at 7,480 m (24,540Â ft). During the desperate retreat that followed, three famous German mountaineers, Uli Wieland, Willo Welzenbach and Merkl himself, and six Sherpas died of exhaustion, exposure and altitude sickness, and several more suffered severe frostbite. The last survivor to reach safety, Ang Tsering, did so having spent seven days battling through the storm. It has been said that the disaster, "for sheer protracted agony, has no parallel in climbing annals."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In 1937, Karl Wien led another expedition to the mountain, following the same route as Merkl's expeditions had done. Progress was made, but more slowly than before due to heavy snowfall. About 14 June seven Germans and nine Sherpas, almost the entire team, were at Camp IV below Rakhiot Peak when it was overrun by an avalanche. All sixteen men died.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The Germans returned in 1938 led by Paul Bauer, but the expedition was plagued by bad weather, and Bauer, mindful of the previous disasters, ordered the party down before the Silver Saddle, halfway between Rakhiot Peak and Nanga Parbat summit, was reached.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aufschnaiter_expedition">Aufschnaiter expedition</span></h3>
<p>Heinrich Harrer, an expert alpinist, was a member of the SS Alpine unit. The unit practised on the Eiger mountain in Switzerland in 1938. When the group returned to Germany, Hitler met with them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In May 1939, Harrer was selected by the German Himalayan Foundation to take part in a new expedition to the Nanga Parbat, under the leadership of Peter Aufschnaiter. Their goal was to scout new ways to make the ascent of the North-western face. They explored the Diamir Face with the aim of finding an easier route. They concluded that the face was a viable route, but the Second World War intervened and the four men were interned by the British in Dehradun, India. Harrer's escape and subsequent wanderings across the Tibetan Plateau became the subject of his book <i>Seven Years in Tibet</i>.  Some evidence of this expedition is kept in the National Archives of Washington D.C..

<p>Nanga Parbat was first climbed, via the Rakhiot Flank (East Ridge), on July 3, 1953 by Austrian climber Hermann Buhl, a member of a German-Austrian team. The expedition was organized by the half-brother of Willy Merkl, Karl Herrligkoffer from Munich, while the expedition leader was Peter Aschenbrenner from Kufstein, who had participated in the 1932 and 1934 attempts. By the time of this expedition, 31 people had already died on the mountain.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The final push for the summit was dramatic: Buhl continued alone for the final 1300 meters, after his companions had turned back. Under the influence of the drugs pervitin (based on the stimulant methamphetamine used by soldiers during World War II), padutin, and tea from coca leaves, he reached the summit dangerously late, at 7 pm, the climbing harder and more time-consuming than he had anticipated. His descent was slowed when he lost a crampon. Caught by darkness, he was forced to bivouac standing upright on a narrow ledge, holding a small handhold with one hand. Exhausted, he dozed occasionally, but managed to maintain his balance. He was also very fortunate to have a calm night, so he was not subjected to wind chill. He finally reached his high camp at 7 pm the next day, 40 hours after setting out. The ascent was made without oxygen, and Buhl is the only man to have made the first ascent of an 8000 m peak alone.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subsequent_attempts_and_ascents">Subsequent attempts and ascents</span></h3>
<p>The second ascent of Nanga Parbat was via the Diamir Face, in 1962, by Germans Toni Kinshofer, Siegfried LÃ¶w, and A. Mannhardt.  The route is now the "standard route" on the mountain. The Kinshofer route does not ascend the middle of the Diamir Face, which is threatened by avalanches from massive hanging glaciers. Instead it climbs a buttress on the left side of the face.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In 1970 the brothers GÃ¼nther and Reinhold Messner made the third ascent of the mountain and the first ascent of the Rupal Face. They were unable to descend by their original route, and instead descended by the Diamir Face, making the first traverse of the mountain. GÃ¼nther was killed in an avalanche on the Diamir Face. (Reinhold Messner's account of this incident has been disputed. In 2005 GÃ¼nther's remains were found on the Diamir Face.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In 1971 Ivan Fiala and Michael Orolin summited Nanga Parbat via Buhl's 1953 route while other expedition members climbed the southeast peak (7,600 m / 24,925Â ft) above the Silbersattel and the foresummit (7,850 m / 25,760Â ft) above the Bazhin Gap.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In 1976 a team of four made the sixth summit via a new route on the Rupal Face (second ascent on this face), then named the Schell route after the Austrian team leader. The line had been plotted by Karl Herrligkoffer on a previous unsuccessful attempt.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>In 1978 Reinhold Messner returned to the Diamir Face and achieved the first completely solo ascent (i.e., always solo above base camp) of an 8,000 m peak.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>In 1984 the French climber Lilliane Barrard became the first woman to climb Nanga Parbat, along with her husband Maurice Barrard.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In 1985, Jerzy Kukuczka, Zygmunt Heinrich, Slawomir Lobodzinski (all Polish), and Carlos Carsolio (Mexico) climbed up the Southeast Pillar (or Polish Spur) on the right-hand side of the Rupal Face, reaching the summit July 13.  It was Kukuczka's 9th 8000m summit.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Also in 1985, a Polish women's team climbed the peak via the 1962 German Diamir Face route.  Wanda Rutkiewicz, Krystyna Palmowska, and Anna Czerwinska reached the summit on July 15.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>"Modern" superalpinism was brought to Nanga Parbat in 1988 with an unsuccessful attempt or two on the <i>Rupal Face</i> by Barry Blanchard, Mark Twight, Ward Robinson, and Kevin Doyle.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>2005 saw a resurgence of lightweight, alpine-style attempts on the Rupal Face:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p>
<ul><li>In August 2005, Pakistani military helicopters rescued Slovenian mountaineer TomaÅ¾ Humar, who was stuck under a narrow ice ledge at 5,900 m (19,400Â ft) for six days. It is believed to be one of the few successful rescues carried out at such high altitude.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In September 2005, Vince Anderson and Steve House did an extremely lightweight, fast ascent of a new, direct route on the face, earning high praise from the climbing community.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On July 17 or 18, 2006, JosÃ© Antonio Delgado from Venezuela died a few days after reaching the summit, where he was caught by bad weather for six days and was unable to make his way down. He is the only Venezuelan climber, and one of few Latin Americans, to have reached the summit of five eight-thousanders. Part of the expedition and the rescue efforts at base camp were captured on video, as Delgado was the subject of a pilot for a mountaineering television series. Explorart Films, the production company, later developed the project into a feature documentary film called <i>Beyond the Summit</i>, which was scheduled to be released in South America in January 2008.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On July 15, 2008, Italian alpinist Karl Unterkircher fell into a crevasse during an attempt to open a new route to the top with Walter Nones and Simon Kehrer. Unterkircher died, but Kehrer and Nones were rescued by the Pakistani Army.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On July 12, 2009, after reaching the summit, South Korean climber Go Mi-Young fell off a cliff on the descent in bad weather in her race to be the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On July 15, 2012 Scottish mountaineers Sandy Allan and Rick Allen made the first ascent of Nanga Parbat via the 10Â km-long Mazeno Ridge, and in April 2013 were awarded the Piolet d'Or for their achievement.</li></ul>

<p>In the first chapter of <i>Mistress of Mistresses,</i> by E.R. Eddison, the narrator compares his now deceased compatriot, Lessingham, to Nanga Parbat in a descriptive passage:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p>
<dl><dd>"I remember, years later, his describing to me the effect of the sudden view you get of Nanga Parbat from one of those Kashmir valleys; you have been riding for hours among quiet richly wooded scenery, winding up along the side of some kind of gorge, with nothing very big to look at, just lush, leafy, pussy-cat country of steep hillsides and waterfalls; then suddenly you come round a corner where the view opens up the valley, and you are almost struck senseless by the blinding splendour of that vast face of ice-hung precipices and soaring ridges, sixteen thousand feet from top to toe, filling a whole quarter of the heavens at a distance of, I suppose, only a dozen miles.  And now, whenever I call to mind my first sight of Lessingham in that little daleside church so many years ago, I think of Nanga Parbat." (<i>Mistress of Mistresses</i>, 1935, p.2-3)</dd></dl>
<p>Jonathan Neale wrote a book about the 1934 climbing season on Nanga Parbat called <i>Tigers of the Snow</i>. He interviewed many old Sherpas, including Ang Tsering, the last man off Nanga Parbat alive in 1934. The book attempts to narrate what went wrong on the expedition, set against mountaineering history of the early twentieth century, the background of German politics in the 1930s, and the hardship and passion of life in the Sherpa valleys.
