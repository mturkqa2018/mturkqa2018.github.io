<p><b>Chinook Jargon</b> (also known as <b><i lang="chn" title="Chinook jargon language text">Chinuk Wawa</i></b>, or <b><i lang="chn" title="Chinook jargon language text">Chinook Wawa</i></b>) is a nearly extinct American indigenous language originating as a pidgin trade language in the Pacific Northwest, and spreading during the 19th century from the lower Columbia River, first to other areas in modern Oregon and Washington, then British Columbia and as far as Alaska and Yukon Territory, sometimes taking on characteristics of a creole language. It is partly descended from the Chinook language, upon which much of its vocabulary is based.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Many words from Chinook Jargon remain in common use in the Western United States, British Columbia and the Yukon, in indigenous languages as well as regional English usage. The total number of Jargon words in published lexicons numbered only in the hundreds, and so it was easy to learn. It has its own grammatical system, but a very simple one that, like its word list, was easy to learn. Though existent in Chinook Jargon, the consonant <span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/r/</span> is rare, and English and French loan words, such as <i>rice</i> and <i lang="fr" title="French language text">merci</i>, have changed in their adoption to the Jargon, to <i lang="chn" title="Chinook jargon language text">lice</i> and <i lang="chn" title="Chinook jargon language text">mahsie</i>, respectively.

<p>The Jargon was originally constructed from a great variety of Amerindian words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language families, speaking dozens of individual languages. It peaked in usage from approximately 1858 to 1900, and declined as a result of the Spanish Flu, World War I and residential schools.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>After European contact, the Jargon also acquired English and French loans, as well as words brought by other European, Asian, and Polynesian groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted The Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the regional toponymy.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In the Diocese of Kamloops, British Columbia, hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using Duployan shorthand via the publication <i>Kamloops Wawa</i>.  As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated scripture and classical works, and some local and episcopal news, community gossip and events, and diaries. Novelist and early Native American activist Marah Ellis Ryan (c. 1860-1934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In Oregon, Chinook Jargon was widely used by Natives, trappers, traders, employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, missionaries, and pioneers who came across the Oregon Trail from the 1830s-1870s. In Portland's first half century (1840s-1890s) there were frequent trade interactions between pioneers and Native Americans. After about 1900, when such daily interactions were less frequent, Jargon was spoken among pioneer families to prove how early they arrived out west. Many Oregonians used Jargon in casual conversation—to add humor, whimsy or emphasis and to exhibit deep knowledge of Oregon's history. Though traditions of speaking Jargon faded away among the non-Native population, some of Oregon's tribal groups continued speaking Chinook Jargon, though usage was diminished. However, a strong revival occurred with the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon's 2012 "Chinuk Wawa" dictionary.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>According to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date "Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like Henry Broderick, the realtor, and Joshua Green, the banker."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Jones estimates that in pioneer times in the 1860s there were about 100,000 speakers of Chinook Jargon.

<p>Most books written in English still use the term Chinook Jargon, but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in Grand Ronde, Oregon prefer the term <i>Chinuk Wawa</i> (with the spelling 'Chinuk' instead of 'Chinook'). Historical speakers did not use the name <i>Chinook Wawa</i>, however, but rather <i>"the Wawa"</i> or <i>"Lelang"</i> (from Fr. <i>la langue</i>, the language, or tongue).  NB <i>Wawa</i> also means speech or words – "have a wawa" means "hold a parley" even in idiomatic English today, and <i>lelang</i> also means the physical bodypart, the tongue.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The name for the Jargon varied throughout the territory in which it was used. For example: <i>skokum hiyu</i> in the Boston Bar-Lytton area of the Fraser Canyon, or in many areas simply just "the old trade language" or "the Hudson Bay language".

<p>There is some controversy about the origin of the Jargon, but all agree that its glory days were during the 19th century. During this era many dictionaries were published to help settlers interact with the First Nations people living there. The old settler families' heirs in the Pacific Northwest sent communiques to each other, stylishly composed entirely in "the Chinook". Many residents of the British Columbia city of Vancouver spoke Chinook Jargon as their first language, even using it at home in preference to English. Among the first Europeans to use Chinook Jargon were traders, trappers, Voyageurs, Coureurs des bois and Catholic missionaries. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Hawaiians and American in the region made much use of it as well. In some places Kanakas married into the First Nations and non-native families and their particular mode of the Jargon is believed to have contained Hawaiian words, or Hawaiian styles of pronunciation. Similarly the Jargon as spoken by a Chinese person or a Norwegian or a Scot will have been influenced by those individuals' native-speaker terms and accents. In some areas the adoption of further non-aboriginal words has been observed. The Chinook Jargon naturally became the first language in multi-racial households and in multi-ethnic work environments such as canneries and lumberyards and ranches where it remained the language of the workplace well into the middle of the 20th century. During the Gold Rush, Chinook Jargon was used in British Columbia by gold prospectors and Royal Engineers. As industry developed, Chinook Jargon was often used by cannery workers and hop pickers of diverse ethnic background. Loggers, fishermen and ranchers incorporated it in their jargon.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>A heavily creolized form of Chinook Jargon (Chinuk Wawa) is still spoken as a first language by some residents of Oregon, much as the Métis language Michif is spoken in Canada. Hence, Chinuk Wawa as it is known in Oregon is now a creole language, distinct from the widespread and widely varied pronunciation of the Chinook Jargon as it spread beyond the Chinookan homeland. There is evidence that in some communities (e.g., around Fort Vancouver) the Jargon had become creolized by the early 19th century and that would have been among the mixed French/Métis, Algonkian, Scots and Hawaiian population there as well as among the natives around the Fort. At Grand Ronde, the resettlement of tribes from all over Oregon in a multi-tribal agency led to the use of Chinuk Wawa as a common tongue among the linguistically diverse population. These circumstances led to the creolization of Chinuk Wawa at Grand Ronde. There is also evidence that creolization occurred at the Confederated Tribes of Siletz reservation paralleling Grand Ronde although, due to language revitalization efforts being focused on the Tolowa language, Chinuk fell out of use.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>No studies of British Columbia versions of the Jargon have demonstrated creolization. The range of varying usages and vocabulary in different regions suggests that localization did occur — although not on the pattern of Grand Ronde where Wasco, Klickitat and other peoples adopted and added to the version of the Jargon that developed there. First-language speakers of the Chinook Jargon were common in BC (native and non-native), until the mid-20th century. It is a truism that while after 1850 the Wawa was mostly a native language in the United States portion of the Chinook-speaking world, it remained in wide use among non-natives north of the border for another century, especially in wilderness areas and work environments. Local creolizations probably did occur in British Columbia, but recorded materials have not been studied as they were made due to the focus on the traditional aboriginal languages.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Many believe that something similar to the Jargon existed before European contact — without European words in its vocabulary. There is some evidence for a Chinookan-Nuu-chah-nulth lingua franca in the writings of John Jewitt and in what is known as the Barclay Sound word-list, from the area of Ucluelet and Alberni. Others believe that the Jargon was formed in the great cultural cauldron of the time of Contact and cannot be discussed separately from that context, with an appreciation for the full range of the Jargon-speaking community and its history.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Current scholarly opinion holds that a trade language probably existed before European contact, which began "morphing" into the more familiar Chinook Jargon in the late 1790s, notably at a dinner party at Nootka Sound where Capts Vancouver and Bodega y Quadra were entertained by Chief Maquinna and his brother Callicum performing a theatrical using mock English and mock Spanish words and mimicry of European dress and mannerisms. There evidently was a Jargon in use in the Queen Charlotte, but this "Haida Jargon" is not known to have shared anything in common with Chinook Jargon, or with the Nooktan-Chinookan "proto-jargon" which is its main foundation.

<p>Pacific Northwest historians are well acquainted with the Chinook Jargon, in name if not in the ability to understand it.  Mentions of and phrases of Chinook Jargon were found in nearly every piece of historical source material before 1900.  Chinook Jargon is relatively unknown to the rest of the population, perhaps due to the great influx of newcomers into the influential urban areas. However, the memory of this language is not likely to fade entirely. Many words are still used and enjoyed throughout Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska. Old-timers still dimly remember it, although in their youth, speaking this language was discouraged as slang.  Nonetheless, it was the working language in many towns and workplaces, notably in ranching country and in canneries on the British Columbia Coast where it was necessary in the strongly multi-ethnic workforce.  Place names throughout this region bear Jargon names (see List of Chinook Jargon placenames) and words are preserved in various rural industries such as logging and fishing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>The Chinook Jargon was multicultural and functional.  To those familiar with it, Chinook Jargon is often considered a wonderful cultural inheritance. For this reason, and because Jargon has not quite died, enthusiasts actively promote the revival of the language in everyday western speech.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon is taking steps to preserve Chinook Jargon use through a full immersion head start/preschool which is conducted in Chinuk Wawa, in hopes of fostering fluency in the language. The Confederated Tribes also offer Chinuk Wawa lessons at their offices in Eugene and Portland, Oregon. In addition, Lane Community College offers two years of Chinuk Wawa language study that satisfy second-language graduation requirements of Oregon public universities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In March 2012, the Tribe published a Chinuk Wawa dictionary through University of Washington Press.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>At her swearing-in as lieutenant governor in 2001, Iona Campagnolo concluded her speech in Chinook, observing that "konoway tillicums klatawa kunamokst klaska mamook okoke huloima chee illahie" - Chinook for "everyone was thrown together to make this strange new country (British Columbia)."

Translation into Chinook Jargon was done by Duane Pasco.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Revival_of_the_language">Revival of the language</span></h2>
<p>Chinuk Wawa was classified as extinct until the 2000s when it was revived, notably in 2014 with the release of <i>Chinuk Wawa—As our elders teach us to speak it</i> by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. In 2018 a textbook for Chinook Jargon in Esperanto ("La Chinuka Interlingvo Per Esperanto", <i>The Chinook Bridge-Language Using Esperanto</i>) was published in both physical and e-book formats by Sequoia Edwards.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>During termination of aboriginal peoples by the United States government, speaking of the language was forbidden, and as a result, developed a decline of speakers. After the conclusion of the termination era with the restoration of tribes in the pacific northwest area, revival of Chinuk Wawa began. To date, there are fluent speakers of Chinuk Wawa, primarily in the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Influence_on_English">Influence on English</span></h2>
<p>British Columbian English and Pacific Northwest English have several words still in current use which are loanwords from the Chinook Jargon, which was widely spoken throughout the Pacific Northwest by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th century. These words tend to be shared with, but are not as common in, the states of Oregon, Washington, Alaska and, to a lesser degree, Idaho and western Montana.

<ul><li><b>Cheechako</b> — Newcomer; the word is formed from "chee" (new) + "chako" (come) and was used to refer to non-native people.</li>
<li><b>Chuck</b> — Water; and thus "saltchuck" salt water.</li>
<li><b>Cultus</b> — means bad, worthless, useless, ordinary, evil or taboo.  "Cultus Iktus" means "worthless stuff".</li>
<li><b>Hiyu</b> —  less common nowadays, but still heard in some places to mean a party or gathering.  From the Chinook for "many" or "several" or "lots of". The Big Hiyu (also known as "The July") was a week-long joint celebration of Dominion Day and the Glorious Fourth in the Fraser Canyon town of Lillooet, featuring horse races, gambling, a rodeo and other festivities. A <i>tenas hiyu</i> (small gathering) was on a much smaller scale. The community of West Seattle has celebrated the month of July for more than 75 years with the HiYu Summer Festival.</li>
<li><b>Iktus</b> — "stuff" in Chinook Jargon, also pronounced "itkus" with 't' and 'k' reversed.</li>
<li><b>Klootchman or Klootch</b> — in the Jargon meaning simply "a woman" or the female of something – <i>klootchman kiuatan</i> (mare), <i>klootchman lecosho</i> (sow), <i>tenas klootchman</i> or <i>klootchman tenas</i> (girl, female child).  Still in use in English in some areas and with people of an older background to mean a First Nations woman, or to refer to the wives/women attached to a certain group in a joking way e.g. "we sent all the klootchman to the kitchen while we played cards".  Unlike its male equivalent <i>siwash</i>, <i>klootchman</i> does not generally have a derisive tone nowadays (when used).</li>
<li><b>Masi</b>  — In northern BC and the Yukon, and used in broadcast English in those areas, the Chinook Jargon adaption of the French <i>merci</i> remains common, i.e. <i>mahsi</i> or <i>masi</i>, with the accent on the first syllable (unlike in French).</li>
<li>It is possible that the slang term <b>moolah</b>, meaning money in American slang, comes from the word 'moolah' meaning 'mill' in Chinook.</li>
<li><b>Potlatch</b> — in Chinook Jargon is a ceremony among certain tribes involving food and exchange of gifts, nowadays sometimes used to refer to a potluck dinner or sometimes the giving away of personal items to friends.</li>
<li><b>Quiggly, quiggly hole</b> — refers to the remains of an old Indian pit-house, or underground house, from "kickwillie" or "kekuli", which in the Jargon means "down" or "underneath" or "beneath".</li>
<li><b>Siwash</b> — (SAI-wash) properly a First Nations man, but sometimes used for women as well.  Nowadays considered extremely derogatory but still in use, typically with the connotation of "drunken no-good Indian".  Historically it did not necessarily have this connotation and was the generic term for Natives to the point where some writers thought there was a "Siwash tribe" in the region.  The origin of the word is from the French <i>sauvage</i>.  When pronounced Sa-WASH, with the rhythm of the original French, it is used by modern speakers of the Chinook Jargon in Grand Ronde, Oregon with the context of meaning a Native American, or as an adjective connoting connection to same (the SAI-wash pronunciation is considered offensive in Grand Ronde).</li>
<li><b>Skookum</b> —  The most versatile  — is <i>skookum</i>, which was used in the Jargon either as a verb auxiliary for <i>to be able</i> or an adjective for <i>able, strong, big, genuine, reliable</i> – which sums up its use in BC English, although there are a wide range of possible usages: a <i>skookum house</i> is a jail or prison (<i>house</i> in the Jargon could mean anything from a building to a room).  "He's a skookum guy" means that the person is solid and reliable while "we need somebody who's skookum" means that a strong and large person is needed.  A carpenter, after banging a stud into place, might check it and decide, "Yeah, that's skookum".  Asking for affirmation, someone might say "is that skookum" or "is that skookum with you?"  <i>Skookum</i> can also be translated simply as "O.K." but it means something a bit more emphatic.</li>
<li><b>Tillicum</b> — means "people/person", "family", and "people".</li>
<li><b>Tolo</b> —  used in Western Washington to mean a semi-formal dance, analogous to the homecoming ball, to which girls ask boys. From the Chinook for "to win".</li>
<li><b>Tyee</b> — leader, chief, boss.  Also "Big Tyee" in the context of "boss" or well-known person.  In Campbell River and in the sport-fishing business, a really big chinook salmon (Campbell River) is a Tyee.  In the Jargon Tyee meant chief, and could also be an adjective denoting "big", as with "tyee salmon" or <i>tyee lamel</i> (boss mule). A <i>hyas tyee</i> means "important/big ruler/leader", i.e. – king, big boss, important ruler, and is also sometimes used in English in the same way as Big Tyee. e.g. "He was the undisputed hyas tyee of all the country between the Johnstone Strait and Comox" This was also the common title used for the famous chiefs of the early era, such as Maquinna, for whom it was applied by Captain Vancouver and others in the context of "king". The <i>Hyas Klootchman Tyee</i> – "Great Woman Ruler", roughly "Her Majesty", was the historical term for Queen Victoria.  The word tyee was commonly used and still occurs in some local English usages meaning "boss" or someone in charge. Business and local political and community figures of a certain stature from some areas are sometimes referred to in the British Columbia papers and histories by the old chiefly name worn by Maquinna, Concomly and Nicola. A man called hyas tyee would have been a senator, a longtime MP or MLA, or a business magnate with a strong local powerbase, long-time connections, and wealth from and because of the area. There is a popular BC news site named <i>The Tyee</i>. Beginning in 1900, <i>Tyee</i> was also the title of the University of Washington Yearbook.</li></ul>
