<p>In 1852, the newspaper started a western division, <i>The Times of California</i>, which arrived whenever a mail boat from New York docked in California. However, the effort failed once local California newspapers came into prominence.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>On September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to <i><b>The New-York Times</b></i>.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The main office of <i>The New York Times</i> was attacked during the New York City Draft Riots</a>. The riots, sparked by the beginning of drafting for the Union Army</a>, began on July 13, 1863. On "Newspaper Row</a>", across from City Hall</a>, Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with Gatling guns</a>, early machine guns, one of which he manned himself.

<p>The newspaper's influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of exposés on William Tweed</a>, leader of the city's Democratic Party—popularly known as "Tammany Hall</a>" (from its early 19th century meeting headquarters)—that led to the end of the Tweed Ring's domination of New York's City Hall.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Tweed had offered <i>The New York Times</i> five million dollars (equivalent to more than 100 million dollars today) to not publish the story.<sup id="cite_ref-happy_200_26-1" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In the 1880s, <i>The New York Times</i> gradually transitioned from supporting Republican Party</a> candidates in its editorials to becoming more politically independent and analytical.<sup id="cite_ref-Davis1921_2_36-0" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> In 1884, the paper supported Democrat</a> Grover Cleveland</a> (former Mayor of Buffalo</a> and Governor of New York State</a>) in his first presidential campaign</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt1881_37-0" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> While this move cost <i>The New York Times</i> a portion of its readership among its more progressive and Republican readers (revenue declined from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883-1884), the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years.<sup id="cite_ref-Davis1921_3_38-0" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>

<p>After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller</a> and other <i>New York Times</i> editors raised $1<span class="nowrap">&#160;</span>million dollars to buy <i>The Times</i>, printing it under the <b>New York Times Publishing Company</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Davis1921_3_38-1" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day.

<p>The paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court</a> decisions supporting freedom of the press</a>, <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</a></i>. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the "actual malice</a>" standard for press reports about public officials or public figures</a> to be considered defamatory</a> or libelous</a>. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard</a> of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof</a> on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In 1971, the <i>Pentagon Papers</i>, a secret United States Department of Defense</a> history of the United States' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War</a> from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan</a> of <i>The New York Times</i> by former State Department</a> official Daniel Ellsberg</a>, with his friend Anthony Russo</a> assisting in copying them. <i>The New York Times</i> began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos</a>, raids along the coast of North Vietnam</a>, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines</a> well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson</a> had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap</a> for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration</a> to fight the ongoing war.<sup id="cite_ref-nytpentagon_54-0" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>When <i>The New York Times</i> began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon</a> became incensed.

The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, <i>The Washington Post</i> began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian</a>, a <i>Post</i> editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the <i>Post</i> received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist</a>, asking them to stop publishing. When the <i>Post</i> refused, the U.S. Justice Department</a> sought another injunction. The U.S. District court</a> judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into <i>New York Times Co. v. United States</a></i>,&#32;403</a>&#32;U.S.</a> 713</a>&#32;(1971). On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment</a> enshrines an absolute right to free speech</a>, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security</a> were at stake.<sup id="cite_ref-nytpentagon_54-1" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>

This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by <i>The New York Times</i> allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow <i>The New York Times</i> to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. <i>The New York Times</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;</span> announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.<sup id="cite_ref-Pérez-Peña,_Richard_15-1" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>In 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">103</span></p><p>Nevertheless, like many other U.S. media sources, the <i>Times</i> had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-Pew_262-0" class="reference">&#91;260&#93;</a></sup> A Pew Research Center</a> survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed "all or most" of the  <i>Times</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;</span>s reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The <i>Times</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;</span>s score was comparable to that of <i>USA Today</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Pew_262-1" class="reference">&#91;260&#93;</a></sup> Media analyst Brooke Gladstone</a> of WNYC's <i>On the Media</a></i>, writing for <i>The New York Times</i>, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation."<sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference">&#91;261&#93;</a></sup>
