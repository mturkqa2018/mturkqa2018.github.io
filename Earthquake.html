<p>An <b>earthquake</b> (also known as a <b>quake</b>, <b>tremor</b> or <b>temblor</b>) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth</a>'s lithosphere</a> that creates seismic waves</a>. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity</a>, or <b>seismic activity,</b> of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word <i>tremor</i> is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the epicenter</a> of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami</a>. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides</a>, and occasionally volcanic activity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In its most general sense, the word <i>earthquake</i> is used to describe any seismic event — whether natural or caused by humans — that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults</a>, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests</a>. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus</a> or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

<p>Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane</a>. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically</a> only if there are no irregularities or asperities</a> along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior</a>. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Ohnaka_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain</a> seismic waves</a>, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory</a>. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture</a> growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy</a> and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.</a><sup id="cite_ref-USGS1_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Earthquake_fault_types">Earthquake fault types</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Fault (geology)</a></div>
<p>There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake</a>: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip</a> and movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended</a> such as a divergent boundary</a>. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened</a> such as at a convergent boundary. Strike-slip faults</a> are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent plate boundaries</a> are associated with the most powerful earthquakes, megathrust earthquakes</a>, including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms</a>, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 30 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 900 times (30 × 30) more energy than a 5.0 magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in World War II</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet which can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1000&#160;km. Examples are the earthquakes in Chile, 1960</a>; Alaska, 1957</a>; Sumatra, 2004</a>, all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault</a> (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault</a> in Turkey (1939) and the Denali Fault</a> in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.

<p>The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault is however not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Thus the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can become 50 to 100&#160;km (Japan, 2011</a>; Alaska, 1964</a>), making the most powerful earthquakes possible.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10&#160;km within the brittle crust,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> thus earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about 6&#160;km.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress level in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that 'pushes' the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (<i>greatest</i> principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass 'escapes' in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, thus the overburden equals the <i>least</i> principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.

<p>Where plate boundaries occur within the continental lithosphere</a>, deformation is spread out over a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the San Andreas fault</a> continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the "Big bend" region). The Northridge earthquake</a> was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the Arabian</a> and Eurasian plates</a> where it runs through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains</a>. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself.

<p>The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate at the ring of fire in depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70&#160;km are classified as 'shallow-focus' earthquakes, while those with a focal-depth between 70 and 300&#160;km are commonly termed 'mid-focus' or 'intermediate-depth' earthquakes.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rupture_dynamics">Rupture dynamics</span></h3>
<p>A tectonic earthquake begins by an initial rupture at a point on the fault surface, a process known as nucleation. The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.<sup id="cite_ref-NRS_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Rupture propagation is generally modeled using a fracture mechanics</a> approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity is a function of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70–90% of the S-wave velocity, and this is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These supershear earthquakes</a> have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake</a> has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom</a> developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as slow earthquakes</a>. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake</a>, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NRS_19-1" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Quaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from earliest times. Prior to the development of strong-motion accelerometers</a> that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated on the basis of the observed effects, as categorized on various seismic intensity scales</a>.  Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the earth's crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions, but also on the strength or <i>magnitude</i> of the rupture, and on its distance.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes</a> was developed by Charles F. Richter</a> in 1935.  Subsequent scales (see seismic magnitude scales</a>) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking, and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today.

<ul><li>Longitudinal P-waves</a> (shock- or pressure waves)</li>
<li>Transverse S-waves</a> (both body waves)</li>
<li>Surface waves</a> — (Rayleigh</a> and Love</a> waves)</li></ul>
<p>Propagation velocity</a> of the seismic waves ranges from approx. 3&#160;km/s up to 13&#160;km/s, depending on the density</a> and elasticity</a> of the medium. In the Earth's interior the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7&#160;: 1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter</a> to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter</a> can be computed roughly.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>In solid rock P-waves travel at about 6 to 7&#160;km per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to ~13&#160;km/s. The velocity of S-waves ranges from 2–3&#160;km/s in light sediments and 4–5&#160;km/s in the Earth's crust up to 7&#160;km/s in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P and S wave <b>times 8</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analyses of seismograms the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>S waves and later arriving surface waves do main damage compared to P waves.

The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions</a> (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity.

<p>Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude</a>, the distance from the epicenter</a>, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic</a> motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and to effects of seismic energy focalization owing to typical geometrical setting of the deposits.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Tsunami</a></div>
<p>Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water – including when an earthquake occurs at sea</a>. In the open ocean the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometers (62&#160;mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800&#160;kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.<sup id="cite_ref-Noson_56-0" class="reference">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 on the Richter</a> magnitude scale do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded.

<p>In modern popular culture</a>, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995</a> or San Francisco in 1906</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Van_Riper_60_76-0" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.<sup id="cite_ref-Van_Riper_60_76-1" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in <i>Short Walk to Daylight</i> (1972), <i>The Ragged Edge</a></i> (1968) or <i>Aftershock: Earthquake in New York</a></i> (1999).<sup id="cite_ref-Van_Riper_60_76-2" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, <i>The Earthquake in Chile</a></i>, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami</a>'s short fiction collection After the Quake</a> depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><p><span id="big_one"></span>The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical "Big One" expected of California</a>'s San Andreas Fault</a> someday, as depicted in the novels <i>Richter 10</a></i> (1996), <i>Goodbye California</a></i> (1977), <i>2012</a></i> (2009) and <i>San Andreas</a></i> (2015) among other works.<sup id="cite_ref-Van_Riper_60_76-3" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, <i>A Comparative Seismology</i>, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup> Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup> Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup> As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup>
