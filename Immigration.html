<p>One theory of immigration distinguishes between push and pull factors.<sup id="cite_ref-knaw_32-0" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Push factors refer primarily to the motive for immigration from the country of origin. In the case of economic migration (usually labor migration), differentials in wage rates</a> are common. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value of wages in one's native country, he or she may choose to migrate, as long as the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic expansion of the US increased immigrant flow, and nearly 15% of the population was foreign born</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> thus making up a significant amount of the labor force.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2_34-0" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> When the opportunity cost</a> is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2_34-1" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Escape from poverty</a> (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push factor, and the availability of jobs</a> is the related pull factor. Natural disasters</a> can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. Research shows that for middle-income countries, higher temperatures increase emigration rates to urban areas and to other countries. For low-income countries, higher temperatures reduce emigration.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Emigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment: religious missionaries</a> and employees of transnational corporations</a>, international non-governmental organizations</a>, and the diplomatic service</a> expect, by definition, to work "overseas". They are often referred to as "expatriates</a>", and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those applying in the host country (for similar work).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Non-economic push factors include persecution</a> (religious and otherwise), frequent abuse, bullying</a>, oppression</a>, ethnic cleansing</a>, genocide</a>, risks to civilians during war</a>, and social marginalization.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows; for instance, people may emigrate in order to escape a dictatorship</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Some migration is for personal reasons, based on a relationship</a> (e.g. to be with family or a partner), such as in family reunification</a> or transnational marriage</a> (especially in the instance of a gender imbalance</a>). Recent research has found gender, age, and cross-cultural differences in the ownership of the idea to immigrate.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> In a few cases, an individual may wish to immigrate to a new country in a form of transferred patriotism</a>. Evasion of criminal justice</a> (e.g., avoiding arrest</a>) is a personal motivation. This type of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or find other loopholes to evade detection. For example, there have been reports of war criminals</a> disguising themselves as victims of war or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form or political form; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support network, and culture.

When they arrive in a new country, this is often with many uncertainties including finding work,<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> where to live, new laws, new cultural norms, language or accent issues, possible racism</a>, and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup>

"It is one of the ironies of post-war European history that, once the freedom to travel for Europeans living under communist regimes, which had long been demanded by the West, was finally granted in 1989/90, travel was very soon afterwards made much more difficult by the West itself, and new barriers were erected to replace the Iron Curtain."  —Anita Böcker<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup></div></div></div>
<p>The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues, such as national security</a> and terrorism</a>, especially in western Europe, with the presence of Islam</a> as a new major religion. Those with security concerns cite the 2005 French riots</a> and point to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a> as examples of the value conflicts arising from immigration of Muslims in Western Europe</a>. Because of all these associations, immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Studies have suggested that some special interest groups</a> lobby</a> for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when impacting other groups. A 2010 European study suggested that "employers are more likely to be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers are more likely to be anti-immigration than employees."<sup id="cite_ref-ssrn_49-0" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that "representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts."<sup id="cite_ref-jpubeco_50-0" class="reference">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Another contributing factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants. The Chairman for the US Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform—which lobby for more permissive rules for immigrants, as well as special arrangements just for Irish people—has stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get—'as will every other ethnic group in the country.<span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>"<sup id="cite_ref-irishlobbyusa_51-0" class="reference">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-nclr_52-0" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Immigrants are motivated to leave their former countries of citizenship, or habitual residence, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of local access to resources</a>, a desire for economic prosperity</a>, to find or engage in paid work, to better their standard of living</a>, family reunification</a>, retirement</a>, climate or environmentally induced</a> migration, exile</a>, escape from prejudice, conflict or natural disaster, or simply the wish to change one's quality of life</a>.
