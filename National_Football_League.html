<p>The <b>National Football League</b> (<b>NFL</b>) is a professional American football</a> league</a> consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference</a> (NFC) and the American Football Conference</a> (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues</a> in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The NFL's 17-week regular season</a> runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week</a>. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs</a>, a single-elimination tournament</a> culminating in the Super Bowl</a>, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The NFL was formed in 1920 as the <b>American Professional Football Association</b> (<b>APFA</b>) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season</a>. The NFL agreed to merge</a> with the American Football League</a> (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl</a> was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_is_world&#39;s_best_attended_pro_sports_league_7-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> and is the most popular sports league in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The Super Bowl is among the biggest club sporting events in the world<sup id="cite_ref-Elite_clubs_on_Uefa_gravy_train_as_Super_Bowl_knocked_off_perch_9-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most watched television programs in American history, all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-Super_Bowl_XLV_Most_Viewed_Telecast_in_U.S._Broadcast_History_10-0" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The NFL's executive officer</a> is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.

<p>On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the Akron Pros</a>, Canton Bulldogs</a>, Cleveland Indians</a>, and Dayton Triangles</a> at the Jordan and Hupmobile</a> auto showroom in Canton, Ohio</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-profootballhof.com_11-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the <i>Canton Evening Repository</i>, intended to "raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules".<sup id="cite_ref-Happy_Birthday_NFL?_12-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Another meeting held on September 17, 1920 with representatives from teams  from four states-Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and Dayton from Ohio; the Hammond Pros</a> and Muncie Flyers</a> from Indiana; the Rochester Jeffersons</a> from New York; and the Rock Island Independents</a>, Decatur Staleys</a>, and Racine (Chicago) Cardinals</a> from Illinois.[1]</a> The league was renamed to the American Professional Football Association (APFA).<sup id="cite_ref-Happy_Birthday_NFL?_12-1" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The league elected Jim Thorpe</a> as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams (the Buffalo All-Americans</a>, Chicago Tigers</a>, Columbus Panhandles</a>, and Detroit Heralds</a> joined the league during the year). The Massillon Tigers</a> from Massillon, Ohio</a> was also at the September 17 meeting, but did not field a team in 1920.

<p>Although the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural season</a> and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 (8 wins, 0 losses, and 3 ties</a>) record.<sup id="cite_ref-1920–1924_14-0" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The first event occurred on September 26, 1920 when the Rock Island Independents</a> defeated the non-league St. Paul Ideals 48–0 at Douglas Park</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-profootballhof.com_11-1" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> On October 3, 1920, the first full week of league play occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
The following season resulted in the Chicago Staleys controversially winning the title</a> over the Buffalo All-Americans</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Buffalo:_A_city_cursed_with_bad_sports_luck_18-0" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> On June 24, 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL).<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In 1932</a>, the season ended with the Chicago Bears (6–1–6) and the Portsmouth Spartans</a> (6–1–4) tied for first in the league standings.<sup id="cite_ref-1925–1937_21-0" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest winning percentage</a> (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie, if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a playoff game</a> between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at Wrigley Field</a> in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium</a>, which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the <i>de facto</i> championship game led the NFL, beginning in 1933</a>, to split into two divisions</a> with a championship game to be played between the division champions.<sup id="cite_ref-The_60-Yard_Circus_22-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The 1934 season</a> also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were absent from the league</a>. The <i>de facto</i> ban was rescinded in 1946</a>, following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban</a> in Major League Baseball</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyclopedia_of_African_American_History,_1896_to_the_Present:_From_the_Age_of_Segregation_to_the_Twenty-first_Century_23-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The NFL was always the foremost professional football league in the United States; it nevertheless faced a large number of rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate American Football Leagues</a> and the All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the Los Angeles Rams</a> (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), the Cleveland Browns</a> and San Francisco 49ers</a> (the last two of which came from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional Canadian football</a> circuit, which formally became the Canadian Football League</a> (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being a different football code</a> than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>A new professional league, the fourth American Football League</a> (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a merger</a> on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the Super Bowl</a>, was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning Super Bowl I</a> and Super Bowl II</a>, and the AFL winning Super Bowl III</a> and Super Bowl IV</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Off-the-field_competition_yields_game-changing_merger_24-0" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: the National Football Conference</a> (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger NFL teams, and the American Football Conference</a> (AFC), consisting of all of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams.<sup id="cite_ref-History:_1961–1970_25-0" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: List of National Football League seasons</a></div>
<p>From 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning in 1935</a>, later shortening this to 11 games in 1937</a> and 10 games in 1943</a>, mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in 1946</a> and to 12 in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in 1961</a>, which it retained until switching to the current 16-game schedule in 1978</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_Regular_Season_Games_Played_per_Season_31-0" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have been made, but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the National Football League Players Association</a> (NFLPA).<sup id="cite_ref-meaningless_32-0" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to 1966</a>, where the champions of each conference would meet in the NFL Championship Game</a>. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a one-game playoff</a> to determine the conference champion. In 1967</a>, the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion New Orleans Saints</a> to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division champions would meet in the NFL playoffs</a>, a two-round playoff.<sup id="cite_ref-Lady_Luck_and_the_Lombardi_legend_33-0" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> The NFL also operated the Playoff Bowl</a> (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from 1960 to 1969. Effectively a third-place game</a>, pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been exhibitions</a> rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.<sup id="cite_ref-This_Day_in_Browns_History_–_Jan._7_34-0" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in 1970</a>, the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,<sup id="cite_ref-History:_1961–1970_25-1" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> would also feature an expanded eight-team eight playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in 1990</a> to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002</a>, the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.<sup id="cite_ref-History_of_the_Wild_Card_35-0" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The NFL gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell</a> labeled it a "distraction", saying "the effects of the tax exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years... Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business." As a result, the league office might owe around US$10&#160;million in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_no_longer_non-profit_after_giving_up_tax_exempt_status_41-0" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>

This chart of the 2017 season standings</a> displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The Philadelphia Eagles in 2017</a> (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the NFC East</a>. Thus, in 2018</a>, the Eagles will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the NFC South</a> and AFC South</a> (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the NFC North</a> and NFC West</a> (highlighted in orange).</div>

<p>Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> The league runs a seventeen-week, 256-game regular season. Since 2001, the season has begun the week after Labor Day (first Monday in September) and concluded the week after Christmas.<sup id="cite_ref-Ghost_of_Christmas_past:_Sports-free_TV_77-0" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> The opening game of the season is normally a home game on a Thursday for the league's defending champion.<sup id="cite_ref-2012_NFL_Schedule_Announced_78-0" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Most NFL games are played on Sundays, with a Monday night game</a> typically held at least once a week and Thursday night games</a> occurring on most weeks as well.<sup id="cite_ref-2012_NFL_Schedule_Announced_78-1" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> NFL games are not normally played on Fridays or Saturdays until late in the regular season, as federal law</a> prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or high school football. Because high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until the third Friday in December.  While Saturday games late in the season are common, the league rarely holds Friday games, the most recent one being on Christmas Day in 2009<sup id="cite_ref-Sports_Law_79-0" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> NFL games are rarely scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used twice since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday due to a blizzard, and in 2012, when the Kickoff game</a> was moved from Thursday to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the Democratic National Convention</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Blizzard_forces_postponement_of_Vikes-Eagles_game_to_Tuesday_80-0" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NFL_season_opener_to_be_held_Wednesday,_Sept._5_81-0" class="reference">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents – two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). The other two games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year – for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference.<sup id="cite_ref-Realignment_for_2002_82-0" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup> In total, each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week, where they do not play any games.<sup id="cite_ref-Unusual_bye_format_traces_to_lockout_83-0" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Although a team's home and away opponents are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates and times for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered "playable schedules" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try and ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_schedule_navigated_World_Series,_other_conflicts_84-0" class="reference">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Following the conclusion of the regular season, a twelve-team single elimination tournament, the NFL Playoffs, is held. Six teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as two wild card teams (the two remaining teams with the best overall record). These teams are seeded according to overall record, with the division champions always ranking higher than either of the wild card teams.<sup id="cite_ref-Tie-breaking_procedures_85-0" class="reference">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup> The top two teams (seeded one and two) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining four teams (seeded 3–6) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second seed. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the Pro Bowl</a>, the league's all-star game</a>. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held the week before the Super Bowl</a>; in previous years, the game was held the week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game was moved to the week before.<sup id="cite_ref-Pro_Bowl_set_for_Jan._27_in_Honolulu,_week_before_Super_Bowl_86-0" class="reference">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup> Because of this, players from the teams participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: Vince Lombardi Trophy</a>, Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy</a>, and Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup</a></div>
<p>The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup</a>, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation</a>. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a "silver loving cup", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-Local_history:_Searching_for_lost_trophy_88-0" class="reference">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>A second trophy, the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy</a>, was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1969. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it.

<p>In the United States, the National Football League has television contracts with four networks: CBS</a>, ESPN</a>, Fox</a>, and NBC</a>. Collectively, these contracts cover every regular season and postseason game. In general, CBS televises afternoon games in which the away team is an AFC team, and Fox carries afternoon games in which the away team belongs to the NFC. These afternoon games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according to a complicated set of rules.<sup id="cite_ref-The_tradition_continues:_NFL_to_remain_on_broadcast_TV_104-0" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network (known as "flexible scheduling").<sup id="cite_ref-Flexible_schedule_flexes_Broncos-Vikings_from_CBS_to_FOX_105-0" class="reference">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup> The only way to legally watch a regionally televised game not being carried on the local network affiliates is to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket</a>, the league's out-of-market sports package</a>, which is only available to subscribers to the DirecTV</a> satellite service. The league also provides RedZone</a>, an omnibus telecast</a> that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they happen.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide.

ESPN carries all Monday Night Football</a> games.<sup id="cite_ref-The_tradition_continues:_NFL_to_remain_on_broadcast_TV_104-1" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> The NFL's own network, NFL Network</a>, broadcasts a series titled <i>Thursday Night Football</a></i>, which was originally exclusive to the network, but which in recent years has had several games simulcast</a> on CBS (since 2014) and NBC (since 2016) (except the Thanksgiving and kickoff games, which remain exclusive to NBC).<sup id="cite_ref-Thursday_Night_Football_Scores_Big_for_the_NFL_106-0" class="reference">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> For the 2017 season, the NFL Network will broadcast 18 regular season games under its <i>Thursday Night Football</i> brand, 16 Thursday-evening contests (10 of which are simulcast on either NBC or CBS) as well as one of the NFL International Series</a> games on a Sunday morning and one of the 2017 Christmas afternoon games. In addition, 10 of the Thursday night games will be streamed live on Amazon Prime</a>. In 2017, the NFL games occupied the top three rates for a 30-second advertisement: $699,602 for Sunday Night Football, $550,709 for Thursday Night Football (NBC), and $549,791 for Thursday Night Football (CBS).<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup>

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: National Football League Draft</a></div>
<p>Each April (excluding 2014 when it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players.

For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the losing team from the Super Bowl always drafts next-to-last.<sup id="cite_ref-Complete_order_of_first_round_of_2011_NFL_Draft_determined_123-0" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup> All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_draft_rules_a_bad_deal_for_Jadeveon_Clowney_124-0" class="reference">&#91;117&#93;</a></sup> Underclassmen</a> that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_officially_grants_draft_eligibility_to_65_underclassmen_125-0" class="reference">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup> Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks, but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts.<sup id="cite_ref-Addressing_NFL_draft_trade_rules,_times_126-0" class="reference">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup>

If they fail to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order, but they do not lose the pick outright.

In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being cancelled, a restocking draft would be held.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Free_agency">Free agency</span></h2>
<p>Free agents</a> in the National Football League are divided into restricted free agents</a>, who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and unrestricted free agents</a>, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as "six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists".<sup id="cite_ref-Questions_and_answers_for_2012_free_agency_137-0" class="reference">&#91;130&#93;</a></sup> Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.<sup id="cite_ref-Questions_and_answers_for_2012_free_agency_137-1" class="reference">&#91;130&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Clubs are given one franchise tag</a> to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_Explained:_The_Franchise_Tag_138-0" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup>
