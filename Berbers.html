<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Berbers are distributed in an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean</a> to the Siwa Oasis</a> in Egypt</a>, and from the Mediterranean Sea</a> to the Niger River</a> in West Africa</a>. Historically, they spoke Berber languages</a>, which together form the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic</a> family. Since the Muslim conquest of North Africa</a> in the seventh century, a large number of Berbers inhabiting the Maghreb (Tamazgha</a>) have in varying degrees used a lingua franca</a>, which in most cases is a Maghrebi Arabic Dialect</a>. After the colonization of North Africa</a> by France</a>, "the French government succeeded in integrating the French language in Algeria by making French the official national language and requiring all education to take place in French."<sup id="cite_ref-forcedFrench_31-0" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Foreign languages, mainly French</a> and to some degree Spanish</a>, inherited from former European colonial powers</a>, are used by most educated Berbers in Algeria</a> and Morocco</a> in some formal contexts, such as higher education or business.

Berbers are not an entirely homogeneous ethnicity and they encompass a range of societies and ancestries. The unifying forces for the Berber people may be their shared language, or a collective identification with Berber heritage and history.

Dihya or Kahina</a> was a religious and military leader who led a fierce Berber resistance against the Arab-Muslim expansion in Northwest Africa.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Further information: Berber (etymology)</a> and Murabtin</a></div>
<p>The name <i>Berber</i> derives from an ancient Egyptian language</a> term meaning "outlander" or variations thereof. The exonym was later adopted by the Greeks, with a similar connotation. Among its oldest written attestations, <i>Berber</i> appears as an ethnonym in the 1st century AD <i>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Despite these early manuscripts, certain modern scholars have argued that the term only emerged around 900 AD in the writings of Arab genealogists,<sup id="cite_ref-khaldoun_39-0" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> with Maurice Lenoir positing an 8th or 9th century date of appearance.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> The English term was introduced in the 19th century, replacing the earlier <i>Barbary</a></i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The Berbers are the <i>Mauri</a></i> cited by the <i>Chronicle of 754</a></i> during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania</a>, to become since the 11th century the catch-all term <i>Moros</i> (in Spanish; <i>Moors</i> in English) on the charters and chronicles of the expanding Christian Iberian kingdoms to refer to the Andalusi</a>, the north Africans, and the Muslims overall.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>For the historian Abraham Isaac Laredo<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> the name Amazigh could be derived from the name of the ancestor Mezeg which is the translation of biblical ancestor Dedan</a> son of Sheba in the <i>Targum</a></i>. According to Leo Africanus</a>, <i>Amazigh</i> meant "free man", though this has been disputed, because there is no root of M-Z-Gh meaning "free" in modern Berber languages. This dispute, however, is based on a lack of understanding of the Berber language</a><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This statement is possibly biased. (November 2015)">neutrality</span></a>&#32;is disputed</a></i>&#93;</sup> as "Am-" is a prefix meaning "a man, one who is [â€¦]" Therefore, the root required to verify this endonym</a> would be <i>(a)zigh</i>, "free", which however is also missing from Tamazight</a>'s lexicon, but may be related to the well attested <i>aze</i> "strong", <i>Tizzit</i> "bravery", or <i>jeghegh</i> "to be brave, to be courageous".<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="The material near this tag possibly contains original research. (November 2015)">original research?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Further, it also has a cognate in the Tuareg</a> word <i>Amajegh</i>, meaning "noble".<sup id="cite_ref-Brett1996_43-0" class="reference">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maddy_44-0" class="reference">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup> This term is common in Morocco, especially among Central Atlas, Rifian and Shilah speakers in 1980,<sup id="cite_ref-inalco_45-0" class="reference">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> but elsewhere within the Berber homeland sometimes a local, more particular term, such as Kabyle</a> or Chaoui</a>, is more often used instead in Algeria.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines mentioned various tribes with similar names living in Greater "Libya" (North Africa) in the areas where Berbers were later found. Later tribal names differ from the classical sources, but are probably still related to the modern <i>Amazigh</i>. The Meshwesh</a> tribe among them represents the first thus identified from the field. Scholars believe it would be the same tribe called a few centuries afterwards in Greek as Mazyes by Hektaios and as Maxyes by Herodotus</a>, while it was called after that <i>Mazaces</i> and <i>Mazax</i> in Latin sources, and related to the later Massylii</a> and Masaesyli</a>. All those names are similar and perhaps foreign renditions of the name used by the Berbers in general for themselves, <i>Imazighen</i>.

<p>In historical times, the Berbers expanded south into the Sahara</a> (displacing earlier populations such as the Azer</a> and Bafour</a>). Much of Berber culture</a> is still celebrated among the cultural elite in Morocco and Algeria.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The areas of North Africa that have retained the Berber language and traditions best have been, in general, Morocco and the Hautes Plaines</a> of Algeria (Kabylie</a>, AurÃ¨s</a> etc.), most of which in Roman and Ottoman times had remained largely independent. The Ottomans did penetrate the Kabylie area, and to places the Phoenicians never penetrated, far beyond the coast, where Turkish influence can be seen in food, clothes and music.

<p>Human fossils excavated at the Ifri n'Amr or Moussa</a> site in Morocco have been radiocarbon-dated</a> to the Early Neolithic</a> period, ca. 5,000 BC. Ancient DNA analysis of these specimens indicates that they carried paternal haplotypes related to the E1b1b1b1a</a> (E-M81) subclade and the maternal haplogroups U6a</a> and M1</a>, all of which are frequent among present-day communities in the Maghreb. These ancient individuals also bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern Berbers, indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. Additionally, fossils excavated at the Kelif el Boroud</a> site near Rabat</a> were found to carry the broadly-distributed paternal haplogroup T-M184</a> as well as the maternal haplogroups K1</a>, T2</a> and X2</a>, the latter of which were common mtDNA lineages in Neolithic Europe</a> and Anatolia</a>. These ancient individuals likewise bore the Berber-associated Maghrebi genomic component. This altogether indicates that the Late Neolithic Kelif el Boroud inhabitants were ancestral to contemporary populations in the area, but also likely experienced gene flow from Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The grand tribal identities of Berber antiquity (then often known as ancient Libyans)<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> were said to be three (roughly, from west to east): the Mauri</a>, the Numidians</a> near Carthage</a>, and the Gaetulians</a>. The Mauri inhabited the far west (ancient Mauretania</a>, now Morocco and central Algeria). The Numidians occupied the regions between the Mauri and the city-state of Carthage. Both the Numidians and the Mauri had significant sedentary</a> populations living in villages, and their peoples both tilled the land and tended herds. The Gaetulians were less settled, with predominantly pastoral</a> elements, and lived in the near south on the margins of the Sahara.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> For their part, the Phoenicians came from the perhaps most advanced multicultural sphere then existing, the Fertile Crescent</a>. Accordingly, the material culture of Phoenicia was likely more functional and efficient, and their knowledge more explanatory, than that of the early Berbers</a>. Hence, the interactions between Berbers and Phoenicians were often asymmetrical. The Phoenicians worked to keep their cultural cohesion and ethnic solidarity, and continuously refreshed their close connection with Tyre</a>, the mother city.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>The earliest Phoenician landing stations located on the coasts were probably meant merely to resupply and service ships bound for the lucrative metals trade with the Iberian</a> peninsula.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> Perhaps these newly arrived sea traders were not at first particularly interested in doing much business with the Berbers, for reason of the little profit regarding the goods the Berbers had to offer.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup> The Phoenicians established strategic colonial cities in many Berber areas, including sites outside of present-day Tunisia, e.g., the settlements at Volubilis</a>, Chellah</a> and Mogador</a> (now in Morocco). As in Tunisia these centres were trading hubs, and later offered support for resource development such as olive oil</a> at Volubilis and Tyrian purple</a> dye at Mogador.

<p>In fact for a time their numerical and military superiority (the best horse riders of that time) enabled some Berber kingdoms</a> to impose a tribute payable by Carthage, a condition that continued into the 5th century BC.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup> Also, due to the Berbero-Libyan Meshwesh</a> dynasty's rule of Egypt (945-715 BC),<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> the Berbers near Carthage commanded significant respect (yet probably appearing more rustic than elegant Libyan pharaohs on the Nile). Correspondingly, in early Carthage careful attention was given to securing the most favorable treaties with the Berber chieftains, "which included intermarriage between them and the Punic aristocracy."<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> In this regard, perhaps the legend about Dido</a>, the foundress of Carthage (see above), as related by Trogus</a> is apposite. Her refusal to wed the Mauritani chieftain Hiarbus might be indicative of the complexity of the politics involved.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Eventually the Phoenician trading stations would evolve into permanent settlements, and later into small towns, which would presumably require a wide variety of goods as well as sources of food, which could be satisfied in trade with the Berbers. Yet here too, the Phoenicians probably would be drawn into organizing and directing such local trade, and also into managing agricultural production. In the 5th century BC, Carthage expanded its territory, acquiring Cape Bon</a> and the fertile Wadi Majardah</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> later establishing its control over productive farm lands within several hundred kilometers.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> Appropriation of such wealth in land by the Phoenicians would surely inspire some resistance by the Berbers, although in warfare, too, the technical training, social organization, and weaponry of the Phoenicians would seem to work against the tribal Berbers. This social-cultural interaction in early Carthage has been summarily described:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Lack of contemporary written records make the drawing of conclusions here uncertain, which can only be based on inference and reasonable conjecture about matters of social nuance. Yet it appears that the Phoenicians generally did not interact with the Berbers as economic equals, but employed their agricultural labor, and their household services, whether by hire or indenture; many became sharecroppers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Warmington,_1960_74-0" class="reference">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> For a period the Berbers were in constant revolt. In 396 there was a great uprising. "Thousands of rebels streamed down from the mountains and invaded Punic territory, carrying the serfs of the countryside along with them. The Carthaginians were obliged to withdraw within their walls and were besieged." Yet the Berbers lacked cohesion, and although 200,000 strong at one point they succumbed to hunger; their leaders were offered bribes; "they gradually broke up and returned to their homes."<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup> Thereafter, "a series of revolts took place among the Libyans [Berbers] from the fourth century onwards."<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The Berbers had become involuntary 'hosts' to the settlers from the east, and obliged to accept the Punic dominance of Carthage</a> for many centuries. The Berbers belonged to the lower social class when in Punic society. Nonetheless, therein they persisted largely unassimilated, as a separate, submerged entity, as a culture of mostly passive urban and rural poor within the civil structures created by Punic rule.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup> In addition, and most importantly, the Berber peoples also formed quasi-independent satellite societies along the steppes of the frontier and beyond, where a minority continued as free 'tribal republics'. While benefitting from Punic material culture and political-military institutions, these peripheral Berbers (also called Libyans) maintained their own identity, culture and traditions, continued to develop their own agricultural and village skills, while living with the newcomers from the east in an asymmetric symbiosis.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>As the centuries passed there naturally grew a Punic society of Phoenician-descent but born in Africa, called <i>Libyphoenicians</i>. This term later came to be applied also to Berbers acculturated to urban Phoenician culture.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup> Yet the whole notion of a Berber apprenticeship to the Punic civilization has been called an exaggeration sustained by a point of view fundamentally foreign to the Berbers.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup> There evolved a population of mixed ancestry, Berber and Punic. There would develop recognized niches in which Berbers had proven their utility. For example, the Punic state began to field Berber Numidian cavalry under their commanders on a regular basis. The Berbers eventually were required to provide soldiers (at first "unlikely" paid "except in booty"), which by the fourth century BC became "the largest single element in the Carthaginian army".<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Yet in times of stress at Carthage, when a foreign force might be pushing against the city-state, some Berbers would see it as an opportunity to advance their interests, given their otherwise low status in Punic society. Thus, when the Greeks under Agathocles</a> (361-289 BC) of Sicily landed at Cape Bon</a> and threatened Carthage (in 310 BC), there were Berbers under Ailymas who went over to the invading Greeks.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup> Also, during the long Second Punic War</a> (218-201 BC) with Rome (see below), the Berber King</a> Masinissa</a> (c. 240-148 BC) joined with the invading Roman general Scipio, resulting to the war-ending defeat of Carthage at Zama, despite the presence of their renowned general Hannibal; on the other hand, the Berber King Syphax</a> (d. 202 BC) had supported Carthage. The Romans too read these cues, so that they cultivated their Berber alliances and, subsequently, favored the Berbers who advanced their interests following the Roman victory.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference">&#91;84&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Carthage was faulted by her ancient rivals for the "harsh treatment of her subjects" as well as for "greed and cruelty".<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup> Her Libyan Berber sharecroppers, for example, were required to pay one-half of their crops as tribute to the city-state during the emergency of the First Punic War</a>.

Hence the frequent Berber insurrections. Moderns fault Carthage for failure "to bind her subjects to herself, as Rome did" her Italians. Yet Rome and the Italians held far more in common perhaps than did Carthage and the Berbers. Nonetheless, a modern criticism tells us that the Carthaginians "did themselves a disservice" by failing to promote the common, shared quality of "life in a properly organized city" that inspires loyalty, particularly with regard to the Berbers.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> Again, the tribute demanded by Carthage was onerous.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>The Punic relationship with the majority Berbers</a> continued throughout the life of Carthage. The unequal development of material culture and social organization perhaps fated the relationship to be an uneasy one. A long-term cause of Punic instability, there was no melding of the peoples. It remained a source of stress and a point of weakness for Carthage. Yet there were degrees of convergence on several particulars, discoveries of mutual advantage, occasions of friendship, and family.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>The Berbers enter historicity gradually during the Roman era</a>.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: Numidia</a> and Jugurthine War</a></div>
<p>Numidia</a> (202 â€“ 46 BC) was an ancient Berber kingdom in modern Algeria and part of Tunisia. It later alternated between being a Roman province</a> and being a Roman client state</a>. The polity was located on the eastern border of modern Algeria, bordered by the Roman province of Mauretania</a> (in modern Algeria and Morocco) to the west, the Roman province of Africa</a> (modern Tunisia) to the east, the Mediterranean to the north, and the Sahara Desert</a> to the south. Its people were the Numidians</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>The name <i>Numidia</i> was first applied by Polybius</a> and other historians during the third century BC to indicate the territory west of Carthage</a>, including the entire north of Algeria as far as the river Mulucha (Muluya</a>), about 160 kilometres (100&#160;mi) west of Oran</a>. The Numidians were conceived of as two great groups: the Massylii</a> in eastern Numidia, and the Masaesyli</a> in the west.
During the first part of the Second Punic War</a>, the eastern Massylii under their king Gala</a> were allied with Carthage, while the western Masaesyli under king Syphax</a> were allied with Rome.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>In 206 BC, the new king of the eastern Massylii, Masinissa</a>, allied himself with Rome, and Syphax of the Masaesyli switched his allegiance to the Carthaginian side. At the end of the war, the victorious Romans gave all of Numidia to Masinissa of the Massylii. At the time of his death in 148 BC, Masinissa's territory extended from Mauretania to the boundary of the Carthaginian territory, and also south-east as far as Cyrenaica</a>, so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage (Appian</a>, <i>Punica</i>, 106) except towards the sea.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Masinissa was succeeded by his son Micipsa</a>. When Micipsa died in 118 BC, he was succeeded jointly by his two sons Hiempsal I</a> and Adherbal</a> and Masinissa's illegitimate grandson, Jugurtha</a>, of Berber origin, who was very popular among the Numidians. Hiempsal and Jugurtha quarreled immediately after the death of Micipsa. Jugurtha had Hiempsal killed, which led to open war with Adherbal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>After Jugurtha defeated him in open battle, Adherbal fled to Rome for help. The Roman officials, allegedly due to bribes but perhaps more likely because of a desire to quickly end conflict in a profitable client kingdom, settled the fight by dividing Numidia into two parts. Jugurtha was assigned the western half. However, soon after conflict broke out again, leading to the Jugurthine War</a> between Rome and Numidia.

<p>Before the eleventh century, most of North-West Africa was a Berber-speaking Muslim area. The process of Arabization only became a major factor with the arrival of the Banu Hilal</a>, a tribe sent by the Fatimids</a> of Egypt to punish the Berber Zirid</a> dynasty for having abandoned Shiism</a>. The Banu Hilal reduced the Zirids to a few coastal towns and took over much of the plains; their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the region and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>After the Muslim conquest</a>, the Berber tribes of coastal North Africa became almost fully Islamized. Besides the Arabian influence, North African population also saw an influx via the Barbary Slave Trade</a> of European peoples, with some estimates placing the number of European slaves brought to North Africa during the Ottoman period as high as 1.25&#160;million.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> Interactions with neighboring Sudanic empires, traders, and nomads from other parts of Africa also left impressions upon the Berber people.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>According to historians of the Middle Ages, the Berbers were divided into two branches, Botr and BarnÃ¨s, descended from Mazigh ancestors, who were themselves divided into tribes and subtribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (e.g. Sanhaja</a>, Houaras, Zenata</a>, Masmuda</a>, Kutama</a>, Awraba, Barghawata</a>, and cetera).

<p>Unlike the conquests of previous religions and cultures, the coming of Islam, which was spread by Arabs</a>, was to have extensive and long-lasting effects on the Maghreb</a>. The new faith, in its various forms, would penetrate nearly all segments of Berber society, bringing with it armies, learned men, and fervent mystics, and in large part replacing tribal practices and loyalties with new social norms and political idioms.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>Nonetheless, the Islamization</a> and Arabization</a> of the region was a complicated and lengthy process. Whereas nomadic Berbers were quick to convert and assist the Arab conquerors, it was not until the twelfth century, under the Almohad Dynasty, that the Christian, Jewish, and animist communities of the Maghreb became marginalized.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Jews persisted within Northern Africa as dhimmis</a>, protected peoples, under Islamic law. They continued to occupy prominent economic and political roles within the Maghreb.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup> Indeed, some scholars believe that Jewish merchants may have crossed the Sahara, although others dispute this claim.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>The first Arabian military expeditions into the Maghreb, between 642 and 669, resulted in the spread of Islam. These early forays from a base in Egypt occurred under local initiative rather than under orders from the central caliphate</a>. But when the seat of the caliphate moved from Medina to Damascus, the Umayyads</a> (a Muslim dynasty ruling from 661 to 750) recognized that the strategic necessity of dominating the Mediterranean dictated a concerted military effort on the North African front. In 670, therefore, an Arab army under Uqba ibn Nafi</a> established the town of Qayrawan</a> about 160 kilometres south of modern Tunis</a> and used it as a base for further operations.

<p>Abu al-Muhajir Dinar</a>, Uqba's successor, pushed westward into Algeria and eventually worked out a modus vivendi with Kusaila</a>, the ruler of an extensive confederation of Christian Berbers. Kusaila, who had been based in Tlemcen</a>, became a Muslim and moved his headquarters to Takirwan, near Al Qayrawan. This harmony was short-lived; Arabian and Berber forces controlled the region in turn until 697. By 711, Umayyad forces helped by Berber converts to Islam had conquered all of North Africa. Governors appointed by the Umayyad caliphs ruled from Kairouan</a>, capital of the new wilaya (province) of Ifriqiya, which covered Tripolitania</a> (the western part of modern Libya), Tunisia, and eastern Algeria.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>The spread of Islam among the Berbers did not guarantee their support for the Arab-dominated caliphate due to the discriminatory attitude of the Arabs. The ruling Arabs alienated the Berbers by taxing them heavily; treating converts as second-class Muslims; and, worst of all, by enslaving them. As a result, widespread opposition took the form of open revolt</a> in 739-40 under the banner of Ibadin Islam. The Ibadin had been fighting Umayyad</a> rule in the East, and many Berbers were attracted by the sect's seemingly egalitarian precepts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>After the revolt, Ibadin established a number of theocratic tribal kingdoms, most of which had short and troubled histories. But others, like Sijilmasa</a> and Tlemcen</a>, which straddled the principal trade routes, proved more viable and prospered. In 750, the Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads as Muslim rulers, moved the caliphate to Baghdad and reestablished caliphal authority in Ifriqiya, appointing Ibrahim ibn al Aghlab</a> as governor in Kairouan</a>. Though nominally serving at the caliph's pleasure, Al Aghlab and his successors, the Aghlabids</a>, ruled independently until 909, presiding over a court that became a center for learning and culture.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>Just to the west of Aghlabid lands, Abd ar Rahman ibn Rustam</a> ruled most of the central Maghreb from Tahert</a>, south-west of Algiers</a>. The rulers of the Rustamid</a> imamate (761-909), each an Ibadi</a> imam</a>, were elected by leading citizens. The imams gained a reputation for honesty, piety, and justice. The court at Tahert was noted for its support of scholarship in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, theology, and law. The Rustamid imams failed, by choice or by neglect, to organize a reliable standing army. This important factor, accompanied by the dynasty's eventual collapse into decadence, opened the way for Tahert's demise under the assault of the Fatimids</a>.
The Muslim Mahdia was founded by the Fatimids</a> under the Caliph</a> Abdallah al-Mahdi</a> in 921 and made the capital city of Ifriqiya</a>, by caliph Abdallah El Fatimi.<sup id="cite_ref-TN_101-0" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup> It was chosen as the capital because of its proximity to the sea, and the promontory on which an important military settlement had been since the time of the Phoenicians</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Lexic_102-0" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>The Fatimids established the Tunisian city of Mahdia</a> and made it their capital city, before conquering Egypt, and building the city of Cairo</a> in 969.

<p>The Muslims who invaded the Iberian Peninsula</a> in 711 were mainly Berbers, and were led by a Berber, Tariq ibn Ziyad</a>, though under the suzerainty</a> of the Arab Caliph</a> of Damascus</a> Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan</a> and his North African Viceroy, Musa ibn Nusayr</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Arab_Conquest_of_Spain,_710-797_103-0" class="reference">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup> Due to subsequent antagonism between Arabs and Berbers, and to the fact that most of the histories of Al-Andalus were written from an Arab perspective, the Berber role is understated in the available sources.<sup id="cite_ref-Arab_Conquest_of_Spain,_710-797_103-1" class="reference">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup> The biographical dictionary of Ibn Khallikan</a> preserves the record of the Berber predominance in the invasion of 711, in the entry on Tariq ibn Ziyad</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference">&#91;104&#93;</a></sup> A second mixed army of Arabs</a> and Berbers came in 712 under Ibn Nusayr himself. They supposedly helped the Umayyad</a> caliph Abd ar-Rahman I</a> in Al-Andalus</a>, because his mother was a Berber.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>Roger Collins suggests that if the forces that invaded the Iberian peninsula were predominantly Berber, it is because there were insufficient Arab forces in Africa to maintain control of Africa and attack Iberia at the same time.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_105-0" class="reference">&#91;105&#93;</a></sup> Thus, although north Africa had only been conquered about a dozen years previously, the Arabs already employed forces of the defeated Berbers to carry out their next invasion.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_105-1" class="reference">&#91;105&#93;</a></sup> This would explain the predominance of Berbers over Arabs in the initial invasion. In addition, Collins argues that Berber social organization made it possible for the Arabs to recruit entire tribal units into their armies, making the defeated Berbers excellent military auxiliaries.<sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference">&#91;106&#93;</a></sup> The Berber forces in the invasion of Iberia came from Ifriqiya</a> or as far away as Tripolitania</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference">&#91;107&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>Governor As-Samh</a> distributed land to the conquering forces, apparently by tribe, though it is difficult to determine from the few historical sources available.<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference">&#91;108&#93;</a></sup> It was at this time that the positions of Arabs and Berbers was regularized across the Iberian peninsula. Berbers were positioned in many of the most mountainous regions of Spain, such as the mountains of Granada, the Pyrenees, and the mountains of Cantabria and Galicia. Roger Collins suggests this may be because some Berbers were familiar with mountain terrain, whereas the Arabs were not.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceC_109-0" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> By the late 710s, there was a Berber governor in Leon</a> or Gijon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference">&#91;110&#93;</a></sup> When Pelagius</a> revolted in Asturias</a>, it was against a Berber governor. This revolt challenged As-Samh's plans to settle Berbers in the Galician and Cantabrian mountains, and by the middle of the eighth century it seems there was no more Berber presence in Galicia.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceC_109-1" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> The expulsion of the Berber garrisons from central Asturias following the battle of Covadonga</a> contributed to the eventual formation of the independent Asturian kingdom.<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference">&#91;111&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>Many Berbers were settled in what were then the frontier lands near Toledo</a>, Talavera</a>, and Merida</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference">&#91;112&#93;</a></sup> Merida</a> became a major Berber stronghold in the eighth century.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup> The Berber garrison in Talavera would later be commanded by Amrus ibn Yusuf</a> and involved in military operations against rebels in Toledo</a> in the late 700s and early 800s.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup> Berbers were also initially settled in the eastern Pyrenees and Catalonia.<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup> Berbers were not settled in the major cities of the south, and were generally kept in the frontier zones away from Cordoba.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>In 731, the eastern Pyrenees were under the control of Berber forces garrisoned in the major towns under the command of Munnuza</a>. Munnuza attempted to lead a Berber uprising against the Arabs in Spain, citing mistreatment of Berbers by Arabic judges in north Africa. Munnuza made an alliance with Duke Eudo</a> of Aquitaine</a>. However, governor Abd ar-Rahman</a> attacked Munnuza before he was ready, and besieging him, defeated him at Cerdanya</a>. Because of the alliance with Munnuza, Abd ar-Rahman wanted to punish Eudo, and his punitive expedition ended in the Arab defeat at Poitiers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference">&#91;123&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>By the time of the governor Uqba</a>, and possibly as early as 714, the city of Pamplona</a> was occupied by a Berber garrison.<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference">&#91;124&#93;</a></sup> An eighth century cemetery has been discovered with 190 burials all according to Islamic custom, testifying to the presence of this garrison.<sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup> In 798, however, Pamplona is recorded as being under a Banu Qasi</a> governor, Mutarrif ibn Musa.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p><p>Al-Hakam</a> wrote that there was a major Berber revolt</a> in north Africa in 740-741, led by Masayra</a>.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>Although Masayra was killed by his own followers, the revolt spread and the Berber rebels defeated three Arab armies.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup> After the defeat of the third army, which included elite units of Syrians commanded by Kulthum</a> and Balj</a>, the Berber revolt spread further. At this time, the Berber military colonies in Spain revolted.<sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference">&#91;132&#93;</a></sup> At the same time, Uqba died and was replaced by Ibn Qatan</a>. By this time, the Berbers controlled most of the north of the Iberian peninsula, except for the Ebro valley, and were menacing Toledo. Ibn Qatan invited Balj and his Syrian troops, who were at that time in Ceuta, to cross to the Iberian peninsula to fight against the Berbers.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference">&#91;133&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>The Berbers marched south in three columns, simultaneously attacking Toledo, Cordoba, and the ports on the Gibraltar straits. However, Ibn Qatan's sons defeated the army of Toledo, the governor's forces defeated the attack on Cordoba, and Balj defeated the attack on the straits. After this, Balj seized power by marching on Cordoba and executing Ibn Qatan.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference">&#91;134&#93;</a></sup> Collins points out that Balj's troops were away from Syria just when the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyads broke out, and this may have contributed to the fall of the Umayyad regime.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference">&#91;135&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>In Africa, the Berbers acted under divided leadership.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>Roger Collins argues that the Great Berber revolt facilitated the establishment of the Kingdom of Asturias</a> and altered the demographics of the Berber population in the Iberian peninsula, specifically contributing to the Berber departure from the northwest of the peninsula.<sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference">&#91;137&#93;</a></sup> When the Arabs first invaded the peninsula, Berber groups were situated in the northwest. However, due to the Berber revolt the Umayyad governors were forced to protect their southern flank and were unable to mount offenses against the Asturians. Some presence of Berbers in the northwest may have been maintained at first, but after the 740s there is no more mention of the northwestern Berbers in the sources.<sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference">&#91;138&#93;</a></sup>

As the governor Ibn Habib</a> was looking for him, he then fled to the more powerful Zanata</a> Berber confederacy, who were enemies of Ibn Habib. Since the Zanata had been part of the initial invasion force of Al-Andalus, and were still present in the Iberian peninsula, this gave Abd ar-Rahman a base of support in Al-Andalus.<sup id="cite_ref-141" class="reference">&#91;141&#93;</a></sup> However, Abd ar-Rahman seems to have drawn most of his support from portions of Balj's</a> army that were still loyal to the Umayyads.<sup id="cite_ref-142" class="reference">&#91;142&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-143" class="reference">&#91;143&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>In 768, a Miknasa</a> Berber named Shaqya ibn Abd al-Walid declared himself a Fatimid</a> imam</a>, claiming descent from Fatimah</a> and Ali</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference">&#91;150&#93;</a></sup> He is mainly known from the work of Ibn al-Athir</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference">&#91;151&#93;</a></sup>
According to Ibn al-Athir, Shaqya's revolt originated in the area of modern Cuenca</a>, an area of Spain that is highly mountainous and challenging to traverse. Shaqya first killed the Umayyad governor of the fortress of Santaver</a> (near Roman Ercavica</a>), and subsequently ravaged the surrounding district of Coria. Abd ar-Rahman sent out armies to fight him in 769, 770, and 771, but Shaqya avoided them by moving into the mountains. In 772, Shaqya defeated an Umayyad force and killed the governor of the fortress of Medellin</a> by a ruse. He was besieged by Umayyads in 774, but the revolt near Seville forced the besieging troops to withdraw. In 775 a Berber garrison in Coria declared allegiance to Shaqya, but Abd ar-Rahman retook the town and chased the Berbers into the mountains. In 776 Shaqya resisted sieges to his two main fortresses at Santaver and Shebat'ran (near Toledo). In 777 Shaqya was betrayed and killed by his own followers, who sent his head to Abd ar-Rahman.<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference">&#91;152&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>Roger Collins notes that both modern historians and ancient Arab authors have had a tendency to portray Shaqya as a fanatic followed by credulous fanatics, and to argue that he was either self-deluded or fraudulent in his claim of Fatimid descent.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference">&#91;153&#93;</a></sup> However, Collins considers him an example of the messianic leaders that were not uncommon among Berbers at that time and earlier. He compares Shaqya to Idris I</a>, a descendant of Ali accepted by the Zanata Berbers, who founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788, and to Salih ibn Tarif</a>, who ruled the Bargawata</a> Berber in the 770s. He also compares these leaders to pre-Islamic leaders Kahina</a> and Kosayla</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference">&#91;154&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">68</span></p><p>In 788, Hisham</a> succeeded Abd ar-Rahman</a> as emir, but his brother Sulayman revolted. Sulayman fled to the Berber garrison of Valencia, where he held out for two years. Finally he came to terms with Hisham and went into exile in 790, together with other brothers of his who had rebelled with him.<sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference">&#91;155&#93;</a></sup> In north Africa, Sulayman and his brothers forged alliances with local Berbers, especially the Kharijite</a> ruler of Tahert</a>. After the death of Hisham I</a> and the accession of Al-Hakam</a>, the brothers challenged Al-Hakam for the succession. Abd Allah crossed over to Valencia first in 796, calling on the allegiance of the same Berber garrison that sheltered Sulayman years earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference">&#91;156&#93;</a></sup> Crossing to Al-Andalus in 798, Sulayman based himself in Elvira (now Granada</a>), Ecija</a>, and Jaen</a>, apparently drawing support from the Berbers in these mountainous southern regions. Sulayman was defeated in battle in 800 and fled to the Berber stronghold in Merida</a>, but was captured before reaching it and executed in Cordoba.<sup id="cite_ref-157" class="reference">&#91;157&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">69</span></p><p>In 797, the Berbers of Talavera</a> played a major part in defeating a revolt against Al-Hakam I</a> in Toledo.<sup id="cite_ref-158" class="reference">&#91;158&#93;</a></sup> A cerain Ubayd Allah ibn Hamir rebelled in Toledo against Al-Hakam. Al-Hakam order Amrus ibn Yusuf</a> to destroy the rebellion. Amrus was the commander of the Berbers in Talavera. Amrus negotiated in secret with the Banu Mahsa faction in Toledo, promising them the governorship if they betrayed ibn Hamir. The Banu Mahsa brought Ibn Hamir's head to Amrus in Talavera. However, there was a feud between the Banu Mahsa and the Berbers of Talavera. The Berbers of Talavera killed all the Banu Mahsa. Amrus sent the heads of the Banu Mahsa along with that of Ibn Hamir to Al-Hakam in Cordoba. The Toledo rebellion was sufficiently weakened that Amrus was able to enter Toledo and convince its inhabitants to submit.<sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference">&#91;159&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">70</span></p><p>Roger Collins argues that unassimilated Berber garrisons in al-Andalus engaged in local vendettas and feuds, such as the conflict with the Banu Mahsa.<sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference">&#91;160&#93;</a></sup> This was due to the limited power of the Umayyad emir's central authority. Collins states that "the Berbers, despite being fellow Muslims, were despised by those who claimed Arab descent."<sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference">&#91;161&#93;</a></sup> As well as having feuds with Arab factions, the Berbers sometimes had major conflicts with the local communities where they were stationed. In 794, the Berber garrison of Tarragona</a> massacred the inhabitants of the city. Tarragona was uninhabited for seven years until the Frankish conquest of Barcelona led to its reoccupation.<sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference">&#91;162&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">71</span></p><p>In 829, one of the leaders of the Toledo rebellion of 797, Hashim al-Darrab, who had been kept under arrest in Cordoba, escaped, returned to Toledo, and started another rebellion.<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference">&#91;163&#93;</a></sup> From Toledo, Hashim attacked the Berber garrisons of Santaver and Talavera, precisely those that had been involved in suppressing the Toledo rebellion a generation earlier. Hashim gained control of Calatrava la Vieja</a>, then a major fortress town, until 834. Hashim was killed in battle in 831, but his followers maintained the rebellion, and Berbers from Calatrava besieged Toledo in 835 and 836. The rebellion was finally ended in 837, when the emir's brother al-Walid became governor of Toledo.<sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference">&#91;164&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">72</span></p><p>Throughout the ninth century, the Berber garrisons were one of the main military supports of the Umayyad regime.<sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference">&#91;165&#93;</a></sup> Although they had caused numerous problems for Abd ar-Rahman I</a>, Collins suggests that by the reign of Al-Hakam, the Berber conflicts with Arabs and native Iberians meant that Berbers could only look to the Umayyad regime for support and patronage, developing solid ties of loyalty to the emirs. However, they were also difficult to control, and by the end of the ninth century the Berber frontier garrisons disappear from the sources. Collins says this might be because they migrated back to north Africa or gradually assimilated.<sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference">&#91;166&#93;</a></sup>

<p>New waves of Berber settlers arrived in al-Andalus in the 10th century, brought in as mercenaries by Abd ar-Rahman III</a> to help him in his campaigns to recover Umayyad authority in areas that had thrown off allegiance to the Umayyads during the reigns of the previous emirs.<sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference">&#91;172&#93;</a></sup> These new Berbers "lacked any familiarity with the pattern of relationships" that had existed in al-Andalus in the 700s and 800s;<sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference">&#91;173&#93;</a></sup> thus they were not involved in the same web of traditional conflicts and loyalties as the existing Berber garrisons.<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference">&#91;174&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></p><p>New frontier settlements were built for the Berber mercenaries who arrived in the 900s.

It was a fortified town, had walls, and a separate fortress or alcazar. Two cemeteries have been discovered also. It was established in the 900s as a frontier town for Berbers, probably of the Nafza tribe. It was abandoned soon after the Castilian occupation of Toledo in 1085. The Berber inhabitants took all their possessions with them.<sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference">&#91;176&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference">&#91;177&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">77</span></p><p>In the 900s, the Umayyad caliphate faced a challenge from the Fatimids</a> in north Africa. The Fatimid caliphate was founded by Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah</a> after his disciples gained a large following among the Kutama</a> Berbers in what is today eastern Algeria and western Tunisia. After taking the city of Kairouan</a> and overthrowing the Aghlabids</a> in 909, the Mahdi Ubayd Allah declared himself caliph, which represented a direct challenge to the Umayyad's own claim to the caliphate.<sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference">&#91;178&#93;</a></sup> The Fatimids gained overlordship over the Idrisids</a>, then launched a conquest of the Maghreb. To counter the threat, the Umayyads crossed the straits to take over Ceuta</a> in 931,<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference">&#91;179&#93;</a></sup> and actively formed alliances with Berber confederacies such as the Zanata</a> and the Awraba. Rather than fighting each other directly, the competition of Fatimids and Umayyads played out as a competition for Berber allegiances. In turn, this provided a motivation for the further Islamic conversion of Berbers, many of whom, particularly farther south away from the Mediterranean, were still Christian and pagan.<sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference">&#91;180&#93;</a></sup> In turn, this would contribute to the development of Almoravids</a> and Almohads</a>, which would have a major impact on al-Andalus and contribute to the end of the Umayyad caliphate.<sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference">&#91;181&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">78</span></p><p>With the help of his new mercenary forces, which were mainly composed of recent Berber arrivals, Abd ar-Rahman launched a series of attacks on parts of the Iberian peninsula that had fallen away from Umayyad allegiance. In the 920s he campaigned against the areas that rebelled under Umar ibn Hafsun</a> and still refused to submit. These he submitted in the 920s. He conquered Merida</a> in 928-929, Ceuta in 931, and Toledo in 932.<sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference">&#91;182&#93;</a></sup> In 934 Abd ar-Rahman III</a> begain a campaign in the north against Ramiro II</a> of Leon and Muhammad ibn Hashim al-Tujibi, the governor of Zaragoza</a>. According to Ibn Hayyan</a>, after inconclusively confronting al-Tujibi on the Ebro, Abd ar-Rahman briefly forced the Kingdom of Pamplona</a> into submission, ravaged Castile</a> and Alava</a>, and met Ramiro II in an inconclusive battle.<sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference">&#91;183&#93;</a></sup> From 935 to 937, Abd ar-Rahman confronted the Tujibids, defeating them in 937.

These would declare loyalty to the Umayyad caliphate in opposition to the Fatimids. The Umayyads would send gifts including embroidered silk ceremonial cloaks. During this time, mints in cities on the Moroccan coast (Fes, Sijilmasah, Sfax, and al-Nakur) occasionally issued coins with the names of Umayyad caliphs, showing the extent of Umayyad diplomatic influence.<sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference">&#91;186&#93;</a></sup> The text of a letter of friendship from a Berber leader to the Umayyad caliph has been preserved in the work of 'Isa al-Razi.<sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference">&#91;187&#93;</a></sup>

The Hammudids remained in Malaga until expelled by the Zirids in 1056.<sup id="cite_ref-218" class="reference">&#91;218&#93;</a></sup> The Zirids of Granada controlled Malaga until 1073, after which separate Zirid kings retained control over the taifas of Granada and Malaga until the Almoravid</a> conquest.<sup id="cite_ref-219" class="reference">&#91;219&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">95</span></p><p>During the taifa period, the Aftasid dynasty</a> based in Badajoz</a> controlled a large territory centered on the Guadiana River</a> valley.<sup id="cite_ref-220" class="reference">&#91;220&#93;</a></sup> The area of Aftasid control was very large, stretching from the Sierra Morena</a> and the taifas of Mertola</a> and Silves</a> to the south, to the Campo de Calatrava</a> in the west and the Montes de Toledo</a> in the northwest and nearly as far as Oporto</a> in the northeast.<sup id="cite_ref-221" class="reference">&#91;221&#93;</a></sup>

Most wanted to trace their lineage back to the Syrian and Yemeni Arabs who accompanied the invasion. In contrast, tracing descent from the Berbers who came with the same invasion "was to be stigmatized as of inferior birth."<sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference">&#91;223&#93;</a></sup> Reilly notes, however, that in practice the two groups had by the 11th century become almost indistinguishable: "both groups gradually ceased to be distinguishable parts of the Muslim population, except when one of them actually ruled a taifa, in which case his origins were well publicized by his rivals. Nevertheless, distinctions between Arab, Berber, and slave were not the stuff of serious politics either within or between the taifas. It was the individual family that was the unit of political activity."<sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference">&#91;224&#93;</a></sup> The Berber that arrived towards the end of the caliphate as mercenary forces, says Reilly, amounted to only about 20 thousand people in a total al-Andalusi population of six million.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="In_Al-Andalus_under_the_Almoravids">In Al-Andalus under the Almoravids</span></h4>
<p>During the taifa period, the Almoravid</a> empire developed in northwest Africa. The core of the Almoravid empire was formed by the Lamtuna</a> branch of the Sanhaja</a> Berber.<sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference">&#91;227&#93;</a></sup> In the mid 11th century, they allied with the Guddala</a> and Massufa Berber. At that time, the Almoravid leader Yahya ibn Ibrahim</a> went on a hajj</a>. On his way back he met Malikite</a> preachers in Kairouan</a>, and invited them to his land. Malikite disciple Abd Allah ibn Yasin</a> accepted the invitation. Traveling to Morocco, he established a military monastery or ribat</a> where he trained a highly motivated and disciplined fighting force. In 1054 and 1055, employing these specially trained forces, Almoravid leader Yahya ibn Umar</a> defeated the Kingdom of Ghana</a> and the Zanata</a> Berber. After Yahya ibn Umar died, his brother Abu Bakr ibn Umar</a> pursued the expansion of the Almoravids. Forced to resolve a Sanhaja civil war, he left control of the Moroccan conquests to his brother, Yusuf ibn Tashufin</a>. Yusuf continued to conquer territory, and following Abu Bakr's death in 1087, Yusuf became the Almoravid leader.<sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference">&#91;228&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">99</span></p><p>After their loss of Cordoba, the Hammudids</a> had occupied Algeciras</a> and Ceuta</a>. In the mid-11th century, the Hammudids lost control of their Iberian possessions, but retained a small taifa kingdom based in Ceuta. In 1083, Yusuf ibn Tashufin conquered Ceuta. In the same year, al-Mutamid</a>, king of the Sevilla taifa</a>, traveled to Morocco to appeal to Yusuf for help against King Alfonso VI</a> of Castile. Earlier, in 1079, the king of Badajoz</a>, al-Mutawakkil, had appealed to Yusuf for help against Alfonso. After the fall of Toledo</a> to Alfonso VI in 1085, al-Mutamid appealed again to Yusuf. This time, financed by the taifa kings of Iberia, Yusuf crossed to al-Andalus, taking direct personal control of Algeciras in 1086.<sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference">&#91;229&#93;</a></sup>

<p>There is an identity-related debate about the persecution of Berbers by the Arab-dominated regimes of North Africa. Through both exclusivities of Pan-Arabism</a> and Islamism,<sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference">&#91;230&#93;</a></sup> their issue of identity is due to the pan-Arabist ideology of the former Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>. Some activists have claimed that "It is timeâ€”long past overdueâ€”to confront the racist arabization of the Amazigh lands."<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference">&#91;231&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">101</span></p><p>Soon after independence in the middle of the twentieth century, the countries of North Africa established Arabic as their official language</a>, replacing French, Spanish and Italian; although the shift from European colonial languages to Arabic for official purposes continues even to this day. As a result, most Berbers had to study and know Arabic, and had no opportunities until the twenty-first century to use their mother tongue</a> at school or university. This may have accelerated the existing process of Arabization of Berbers, especially in already bilingual areas, such as among the Chaouis</a> of Algeria. Tamazight is now taught in Aures since the march led by Mr. Salim Yezza</a> in 2004, which has started to the teaching of Tamazight in the schools in Aures.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">102</span></p><p>While Berberism</a> had its roots before the independence of these countries, it was limited to the Berber elite. It only began to gain success among the greater populace when North African states replaced their European colonial languages with Arabic and identified exclusively as Arabian nations, downplaying or ignoring the existence and the social specificity of Berbers. However, its distribution remains highly uneven. In response to its demands, Morocco and Algeria have both modified their policies, with Algeria redefining itself constitutionally as an "Arab, Berber, Muslim nation".

<p>Now, Berber is a "national" language in Algeria and is taught in some Berber-speaking areas as a noncompulsory language. In Morocco, after the constitutional reforms of 2011, Berber has become an official language, and is now taught as a compulsory language in all schools regardless of the area or the ethnicity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">104</span></p><p>Berbers have reached high positions in the social hierarchy across the Maghreb</a>; good examples are the former president of Algeria, Liamine Zeroual</a>, and the former prime minister of Morocco, Driss Jettou</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">105</span></p><p>Nevertheless, Berberists</a> who openly show their political orientations rarely reach high hierarchical positions. But, there are some exceptions; for example, Khalida Toumi</a>, a feminist and Berberist militant, has been nominated as head of the Ministry of Communication in Algeria.

The most recent influence came from Islam</a> and pre-Islamic Arab religion</a> during the medieval period.

<p>Traditionally, men take care of livestock</a>. They migrate by following the natural cycle of grazing</a>, and seeking water and shelter. They are thus assured with an abundance of wool, cotton and plants used for dyeing. For their part, women look after the family and handicrafts - first for their personal use, and secondly for sale in the souqs</a> in their locality.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">149</span></p><p>The Berber tribes traditionally weave kilims</a>. The tapestry</a> maintains the traditional appearance and distinctiveness of the region of origin of each tribe, which has in effect its own repertoire of drawings. The textile</a> of plain weave</a> is represented by a wide variety of stripes, and more rarely by geometrical patterns such as triangles and diamonds. Additional decorations such as sequins or fringes, are typical of Berber weave in Morocco. The nomadic</a> and semi-nomadic lifestyle of the Berbers is very suitable for weaving kilims. The customs and traditions differ from one region to another.<sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference">&#91;269&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">150</span></p><p>The social structure of the Berbers is tribal. A leader is appointed to command the tribe. In the Middle Ages, many women had the power to govern, such as Kahina</a> and Tazoughert Fatma</a> in the AurÃ¨s Mountains</a>, Tin Hinan</a> in the Hoggar</a>, Chemci</a> in AÃ¯t Iraten</a>, Fatma Tazoughert</a> in the AurÃ¨s. Lalla Fatma N'Soumer</a> was a Berber woman in Kabylie</a> who fought against the French.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">151</span></p><p>The majority of Berber tribes currently have men as heads of the tribe. In Algeria, the el Kseur platform</a> in Kabylie</a> gives tribes the right to fine criminal offenders. In areas of Chaoui</a>, tribal leaders enact sanctions against criminals.<sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference">&#91;270&#93;</a></sup> The Tuareg have a king who decides the fate of the tribe and is known as Amenokal</a>. It is a very hierarchical society. The Mozabites are governed by the spiritual leaders of Ibadism. The Mozabites lead communal lives. During the crisis of Berriane</a>, the heads of each tribe resolved the problem and began talks to end the crisis between the Maliki</a> and Ibadite movements.<sup id="cite_ref-271" class="reference">&#91;271&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">152</span></p><p>In marriages, the man selects the woman, and depending on the tribe, the family often makes the decision. In comparison, in the Tuareg culture, the woman chooses her future husband. The rites of marriage are different for each tribe. Families are either patriarchal or matriarchal, according to the tribe.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Berber cuisine</a></div>
<p>Berber cuisine is a traditional cuisine which has evolved little over time. It differs from one area to another within and among Berber groups.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">159</span></p><p>Principal Berber foods are:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">160</span></p>
<ul><li>Couscous</a>, a semolina</a> staple dish</li>
<li>Tajine</a>, a stew made in various forms</li>
<li>Pastilla</a>, a meat pie traditionally made with squab (fledgling pigeon) often today using chicken</li>
<li>Bread</a> made with traditional yeast</a></li>
<li><i>Bouchiar</i> (fine yeastless wafers</a> soaked in butter and natural honey</a>)</li>
<li><i>Bourjeje</i> (pancake</a> containing flour, eggs, yeast and salt)</li>
<li><i>Baghrir</i> (light and spongy pancake made from flour, yeast, salt, served hot and soaked in butter and <i>tment</i> (honey).)</li>
<li><i>Tahricht</i> (sheep offal</a>: brains, tripe, lungs, and heart): these organ meats are rolled up with the intestines on an oak stick and cooked on embers in specially designed ovens</a>. The meat is coated with butter</a> to make it even tastier. This dish is served mainly at festivities.</li></ul>
<p>Although they are the original inhabitants of North Africa, and in spite of numerous incursions by Phoenicians</a>, Romans</a>, Byzantines</a>, Ottomans</a> and French, Berber groups lived in very contained communities. Having been subject to limited external influences, these populations lived free from acculturating</a> factors.

<p>Berber music</a>, the traditional music of North Africa, has a wide variety of regional styles. The best known are the Moroccan music</a>, the popular Gasba</a>, Kabyle</a> and Chawi</a> music of Algeria, and the widespread Tuareg music of Burkina Faso</a>, Niger, and Mali. The instruments</a> used are the bendir</a> (large drums) and Gambra</a> (a lute</a>), which accompanying songs and dances.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">165</span></p><p>Traditional Kabyle music consists of vocalists accompanied by a rhythm</a> section, consisting of e'á¹¯bel</a> (tambourine</a>) and bendir (frame drum), and a melody section, consisting of a ghaita</a> (bagpipe</a>) and ajouag</a> (flute</a>). Kabyle music has been popular in France since the 1930s, when it was played at cafÃ©s. As it evolved, Western string instruments and Arab musical</a> conventions, like large backing orchestras, were added.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">166</span></p><p>By the time raÃ¯, a style of Algerian popular music, became popular in France and elsewhere in Europe, Kabyle artists began using less traditional instruments and formats. Hassen Zermani</a>'s all-electric Takfarinas</a> (playing the Algerian mandole</a>) and Abdelli</a>'s work with Peter Gabriel</a>'s Real World</a> helped bring Kabyle music to new audiences, while the murder of Matoub Lounes</a> inspired many Kabyles to rally around their popular musicians.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">167</span></p><p>There are three varieties of Berber folk music: village and ritual music, and the music performed by professional musicians.
Village music is performed collectively for dancing, including ahidus</a> and ahouach</a> dances. Instruments include flutes</a> and drums</a>. These dances begin with a chanted prayer. Ritual music is performed at regular ceremonies to celebrate marriages and other important life events. Ritual music is also used as protection against evil spirits. Professional musicians (<i>imdyazn</i>) travel in groups of four, led by a poet (<i>amydaz</i>). The amydaz performs improvised poems, often accompanied by drums and rabab</a> (a one-stringed fiddle</a>), along with a <i>bou oughanim</i> who plays a double clarinet</a> and acts as a clown</a> for the group.

<p>The Chleuh</a> Berbers have professional musicians called <i>rwai</i>s who play in ensembles consisting of lutes</a>, rababs and cymbals</a>, with any number of vocalist. The leader, or <i>rayes</i>, leads the choreography</a> and music of the group. These performances begin with an instrumental <i>astara</i> on rabab, which also gives the notes of the melody which follows. The next phase is the <i>amarg</i>, or sung poetry, and then <i>ammussu</i>, a danced overture, <i>tammust</i>, an energetic song, <i>aberdag</i>, a dance, and finally the rhythmically swift <i>tabbayt</i>. There is some variation in the presentation of the order, but the <i>astara</i> always begins, and the <i>tabbayt</i> always ends.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">169</span></p><p>Traditional Berber festivals include Fantasia</a>. Imilchil Marriage Festival</a> and Udayn n Acur</a>.
