<p>This area was the home of the Luiseño, Tongva, and Juaneño Indians at one time.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h3>
<p>In 1834, Jose Antonio Yorba's most successful son, Bernardo Yorba (after whom the city would later be named), was granted the 13,328-acre (53.94 km) Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana by Mexican governor José Figueroa. Most of this original land was retained after the Mexican–American War in 1848 by descendants of the Yorba family. A portion of the city's land is still owned and developed by descendants of Samuel Kraemer, who acquired it through his marriage to Angelina Yorba, the great-granddaughter of Bernardo Yorba. The site of the Bernardo Yorba Hacienda, referred to as the Don Bernardo Yorba Ranch House Site, is listed as a California Historical Landmark.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Near that same site sits the second oldest private cemetery in the county, the historic Yorba Cemetery. The land was given to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles by Bernardo Yorba in 1858 since Orange County was not established out of Los Angeles County as a separate county until 1889. The cemetery closed in 1939 and was subsequently vandalized; however, in the 1960s, the Orange County Board of Supervisors took possession of the property to repair the damage, and tours are now available one day per month.

<p>A section of the land was sold in 1907 by the Yorba family to Fullerton businessman Jacob Stern, who used the land for barley fields and sheep grazing. Stern subsequently sold the tract to the Janss Investment Company, which first called the area Yorba Linda, and proceeded to subdivide the land and sell it for agriculture and manufacturing. In 1910, the agricultural aspect of that endeavor materialized, and the first of many lemon and orange groves were planted: at the time, the population was still less than 50. A year later, The Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company began serving Yorba Linda, and the first school was constructed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1912, several things happened in Yorba Linda: it received its first post office; the Yorba Linda Citrus Association was founded; the Southern California Edison Company began providing electricity; and the first church was constructed. The area that would later become downtown was also connected to Los Angeles by the Pacific Electric Railway in 1912, primarily for citrus transport.

<p>In 1913, Richard Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, the chamber of commerce was set up, a library opened as part of the school, and avocado trees were first planted. A year later, a separate district was established for the library system.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In 1915, the Susanna Bixby Bryant Ranch house was constructed. It is a museum that is open to the public.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In 1917, the first street was paved, Yorba Linda Boulevard. The <i>Yorba Linda Star</i> began publication also. It has since become an online section of the OC Register. A printed version of the Star is available at various city buildings free of charge and is delivered to every household in Yorba Linda each Thursday. Past articles are on microfilm at the Yorba Linda Public Library.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The population exceeded 300 for the first time prior to 1920. In 1929, the citrus association's packing house burned down, as it was made of wood. It reopened the next year. During this period, the eastern two-thirds of Yorba Linda (east of the Yorba Linda Country Club) remained part of cattle and agricultural ranches controlled by pioneer families such as the Yorba, de los Reyes, Kraemer, Travis, Dominguez, Friend, and Bryant ranches.

Soon after this photo was taken, Yorba Linda would transform from a rural community to a suburban one.</div></div></div>
<p>The small town had grown significantly by the 1960s, with more than 1,000 residents by the 1960 Census. Three annexation attempts were made by adjoining cities: Brea in 1958 and  Anaheim and Placentia in 1963. These experiences culminated in incorporation, which occurred in 1967.

<p>The new city implemented a municipal general plan in 1972. By the 1980 Census, the population was nearing 30,000. Within ten years it exceeded 50,000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In 1990, the Birthplace of Richard Nixon opened as a public library and museum. It would later become a federal presidential library. In 1994, the community center opened.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>With over 20,000 housing units in the city as of 2016, many residents now oppose further urban development and have organized to reduce traffic congestion.  The Yorba Linda Preservation Foundation seeks to protect historical buildings in the city.

<p>In 2005, CNN ranked Yorba Linda 21st among the best places in the U.S. to live. In 2012, Yorba Linda was ranked 42nd on Money magazine's list of America's best small cities. Similarly, in an article by CNN Money, Yorba Linda was one of the richest U.S. cities and the richest in Orange County as reported by the Census data, showing a median household income of more than $120K: "Among towns of between 65,000 and 250,000 in population, Yorba Linda, California, where six-figure incomes are the rule, had the highest median income at $121,075".  Yorba Linda has been identified as one of the richest cities in the U.S. by the U.S. Census Bureau, which shows a median household income of $121,075, higher than any other city in 2006.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In 2007, Yorba Linda High School broke ground after many years of planning.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In November 2008, eastern Yorba Linda suffered from fires that destroyed 113 homes and damaged 50 others. The destruction was due largely to erratic winds causing embers to fly up to half a mile away.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Savi_Ranch">Savi Ranch</span></h3>
<p>Savi Ranch is an acronym of <i>S</i>anta <i>A</i>na <i>V</i>alley <i>I</i>rrigation, an early water company.
Savi Ranch today contains retailers, auto dealers, restaurants, hotels, and office buildings.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Originally, the city pursued construction of an auto mall on the entire Savi Ranch site. The original plan was rejected by residents in favor of a combination of retail stores, restaurants, hotels, and office buildings. As of 2018, one of the three original car lots has been converted into state-mandated low-income housing, one is vacant, and the sole remaining car dealer, specializing in high-end, exotic, &amp; specialty used cars, is notably thriving.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>As a significant source of sales tax revenue to Yorba Linda and as one of the first anchor tenants (along with Best Buy), The Home Depot became a political talking point in its own right, due to the geography that divides Savi Ranch into two sections, the larger east side falling within Yorba LInda's city limits, and the west side where Home Depot is situated falling within the adjacent City of Anaheim boundaries. At the inception of Savi Ranch, the Home Depot was located in Savi Ranch East. In the early 2000s, however, the Super Kmart location in Savi Ranch West ceased operations and The Home Depot moved into the location it previously occupied, taking the sales tax revenue with it to Anaheim.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>Also located in the Yorba Linda side of Savi Ranch is the headquarters of John Force Racing, housing operations &amp; hosting displays of legendary 16-time NHRA Funny Car Champion John Force, his team of drivers, and their cars. An on-site museum is dedicated to Force's career.
