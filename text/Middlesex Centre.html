<p><b>Middlesex Centre</b> is a township in south-western Ontario, Canada. It is to the north and west of London and is in Middlesex County. The Corporation of the Township of Middlesex Centre formed on January 1, 1998, with the amalgamation of the former Townships of Delaware, Lobo, and London (not to be confused with the adjacent City of London). It is part of the London census metropolitan area.
<a name="text1"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Middlesex Centre is halfway between two of the five Great Lakes. It is north of Lake Erie, and southeast of Lake Huron. Further to the east of Middlesex Centre is Lake Ontario, while to the west is the much smaller Lake St. Clair.  This makes the Township of Middlesex Centre very desirable for farming due to frequent precipitation, while it also has higher than normal snowfall from lake-effect snow in the winter creating desirable spring planting conditions (yet less desirable snow removal issues for its residents). The same benefits that the Township receives from the precipitation of the surrounding lakes also subjects the area to severe summer weather conditions due to the convection of any of the surrounding bodies of water in the hot summer heat. Middlesex Centre is within Canada's Tornado Alley, and suffered a hit by an F2 tornado in 1990 at Komoka. Numerous funnel clouds are spotted in the township every summer.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Communities">Communities</span></h2>
<p>The township is composed of the communities of Arva, Ballymote, Birr, Bryanston, Coldstream, Delaware, Denfield, Duncrief, Ettrick, Ilderton, Kilworth, Komoka, Littlewood, Lobo Village, Melrose, Poplar Hill, Sharon, Southgate, Telfer and Vanneck.
<a name="text3"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>A record snowfall (aka "Snow-maggeden") occurred between Dec. 4-8, 2010, affecting Huron and Middlesex Counties. A total of 177 centimetres (70 in) of snow fell during a 102-hour period (it snowed on 98 of those 102 hours).
<a name="text4"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arva">Arva</span></h3>
<p><b>Arva</b> is at the intersection of Provincial Highway 4 (Richmond Street) and Medway Road (7th Concession). The community is the home of Medway High School, Centennial Central Public Dual Track School, Tamarak tree farm, Weldon Park, the Arva Flour Mill and store, The MillHouse ( local, natural and organic foods), a consignment store, a furniture store, a chocolate shop, a tack shop, a post office, and two churches, as well as personalities such as the former mayor of the City of London, Ontario and former Member of Parliament for London North Centre Joe Fontana (Joe Fontana still resides in the Township of Middlesex Centre at Arva; as the City of London does not have a residency requirement in place for elected officials disallowing him to reside outside of the city limits while holding the mayoral office), as well as Ben Dreyer, a famous area horseback rider, hunter, tanner, and first nation's skinner.  Arva is on a pond (known as "the mill pond") on Medway Creek. There is also a forest known as the sanctuary (in  St. John's Estates); the bush runs along the creek and goes down into a camp site that at one time was quite popular.
<a name="text5"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>A person living in Arva, and who has been for an extensive amount of time, is considered an Arvite.
<a name="text6"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In the 19th century Arva was a critical rest stop on the Underground Railroad, and home to several homes constructed as part of the Railroad.
<a name="text7"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>On July 7, 2007, The White Stripes performed a free concert at the Arva Flour Mill as part of their Canadian tour.
<a name="text8"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Birr">Birr</span></h3>
<p><b>Birr</b> is at the intersection of Highway 4 (Richmond Street) and the 13th Concession. Despite its small size, Birr has maintained itself and supported various private business throughout the years. There are also two churches, three cemeteries, a general store called Legg's General Store, a furniture store and a book store.
<a name="text9"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Until it was replaced by a modern low-rise cement bridge in the mid-1970s, Birr had a one-lane iron bridge on the 13th Concession that crossed the Medway Creek.  Birr had a hotel in the late 19th century; afternoon stagecoaches running between London and Lucan, 7 miles to the north, would stop overnight in Birr, in those days the approximate half-way point, and resume travel the next day.
<a name="text10"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coldstream">Coldstream</span></h3>
<p><b>Coldstream</b> is a hamlet in Middlesex Centre with a population of approximately 200. The municipal offices for Middlesex Centre are in Coldstream. Before it became Middlesex Centre by combining the Townships of Delaware, Lobo, and London in 1998, Coldstream was included in Lobo Township and was situated in the centre of Lobo. It is estimated that immigrants from Scotland obtained land grants and settled as early as 1820 in Lobo. Coldstream was previously known as Cutler, likely because the Cutler family operated and owned much of the town. Today Coldstream has an antique and quilt shop, elementary school (Valleyview Public School), fire hall, library, concrete business, conservation area and the Municipal Office for Middlesex Centre, as well as many volunteer organizations and events within the community.
<a name="text11"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The Friend’s Meeting House was established on Quaker Lane in 1850 and a library was organized in 1887.
<a name="text12"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Much of the industry that Coldstream was founded upon has relocated to larger towns and cities such as Ilderton and London.
<a name="text13"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Delaware">Delaware</span></h3>
<p><b>Delaware</b> straddles the Thames River, and is accessed by the old highway (Highway 2) linking London and Chatham and the freeway (Highway 402) linking Sarnia along with Port Huron and Toronto. The community of Delaware was first founded in 1796. Delaware was the objective of an American raid into Upper Canada in 1814 during the War of 1812, which resulted in the Battle of Longwoods, on March 4, 1814, just about 24 km outside of Delaware.
<a name="text14"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Delaware has two elementary schools, Delaware Central Public School (The Mustangs) (Thames Valley District School Board), and Our Lady of Lourdes (The Saints) (London District Catholic School Board). They are about one kilometre apart. Delaware Central has about 175 students, while Our Lady of Lourdes has around 400.
<a name="text15"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Delaware is nestled in the Thames River Valley, although it has now expanded over the top of the valley ridge. Most of the area surrounding Delaware is made up of forests and floodplain areas. Corn, soybeans and tobacco are farmed extensively in the area around Delaware, as well as inside the town limits in some areas. Delaware has undergone modest growth in housing over the last 30 years, with the developed area nearly doubling in that time. Many of the buildings in the heart of Delaware are reputed to be over one hundred years old. These include the building that is now Delaware Variety as well as the antique shop across the street. Belvoir Manor is a private home that was at one point a seminary and a private school for boys, and at one point was destroyed by fire. The surrounding Belvoir Farms in which it is located is a prominent croquet venue for Croquet Canada.
<a name="text16"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Delaware boasts a number of tourist destinations despite its small size. Delaware Speedway is a half-mile paved race track that is one of the oldest in Canada. The track hosts stock car racing every Friday night during the summer, as well as several Saturday and Sunday race features. The track has also hosted major concert events in the past including I Mother Earth and Matthew Good. The Longwoods Road Conservation Area features Skah-Nah-Doht, a recreated Iroquoian village complete with longhouses and tours, as well as a museum featuring exhibits of Iroquoian culture and archaeological artifacts.  The park hosts a yearly native festival as well as a re-enactment of the Battle of Longwoods.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elginfield">Elginfield</span></h3>
<p><b>Elginfield</b> is at the corner of Highway 4 and Highway 7, with the junction of Highway 23 just to the east. The University of Western Ontario operates an observatory near the community.
<a name="text18"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ilderton">Ilderton</span></h3>
<p><b>Ilderton</b> is along Middlesex County Road 16 (Ilderton Road) to the west of Highway 4 (Richmond Street), at the junction of Middlesex County Road 20 (Hyde Park Road). Prior to the late 1990s, the village was also accessible by railway. CN Rail had a rail line running north from Hyde Park to Clinton through the village. This rail line was abandoned from Ilderton north to Centralia in 1988, and south of Ilderton circa 1996. The portion of the former rail line south of County Road 16 has been converted to parkland.

At other times of the year the fairgrounds host many agricultural and equine events, the arena is home to sporting events year-round and is the focus for local hockey through the fall to spring. Alongside the arena is the famous Ilderton Curling Club, with what is reputed to be the best ice around. Its many members, guests and visiting teams make it a busy 4-sheet surface and its luxurious bar overlooking the ice provides a convivial venue for after-game relaxation. During the winter Ilderton becomes a hub for snow-mobilers as there are several trails which pass through or close by plus the availability of fuel for both machines and riders.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Komoka">Komoka</span></h3>
<p><b>Komoka</b> village is a crossing point for many railway lines and was formerly a railway hot spot featuring various hotels and development.  Today, the Komoka Railway museum keeps the local railway history alive and features unique artifacts such as a 1913 Shay Steam Engine and a 1972 Grand Trunk Western caboose. There is an elementary school - Parkview Public School, and Providence Reformed Collegiate − a private Christian high school, and the new Komoka Wellness Centre in the village. The village also supports a number of youth sports teams, including baseball and soccer.  The Komoka Park has two baseball and two soccer fields, tennis courts, and a children's play area.  There are two small business areas in the village: the downtown Komoka Foodtown and Post Office area, and the Glendon Drive / Komoka Road intersection with a bank, gas stations and variety stores, restaurants, and hair salon.
<a name="text27"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Komoka is experiencing a population growth due to several new subdivision developments. Consequently, the elementary school's enrolment has rapidly increased resulting in substantial renovations. In 1986 a 20 unit seniors apartment building was built and named the Malott Apartments, after the Late Arthur Malott who donated all the funds for its construction. In 2009 a second 20 unit seniors apartment building was added to form the Komoka Seniors Apartments Complex. In 2011 the new Komoka Community Wellness Centre was opened and is home to the Elgin Middlesex Chiefs AAA Hockey teams, and was home to the Komoka Dragons Jr A hockey team of the GMHL. It also offers a YMCA  fitness centre, walking track, two NHL size ice rinks, a library, meeting rooms, and an outside children's play area. Komoka Provincial Park with walking trails is close by, as well as FireRock, so named because of finding an old native fire rock on the site during the new golf course construction, Oxbow Glen Golf and Country Club and The Oaks golf courses. The village has a Middlesex County EMS satellite ambulance station.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kilworth_Heights">Kilworth Heights</span></h3>
<p>Kilworth Heights takes up most of the area between Komoka and London, Ontario which is south of County Road 14 (Glendon Rd) and north of Komoka Provincial Park and the Thames River. It is separate from Kilworth, which lies along Glendon Rd on the east side of the Thames River and is part of London.
<a name="text30"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Although Kilworth Heights is part of Middlesex Centre, demographically most of Kilworth Heights is a commuting exurb of Komoka. It has no independent industry, no schools, no major grocery store, no banks, and only two small commercial areas, including child care, veterinarian, restaurant, and a gas bar. All the rest of Kilworth Heights is single-unit residential. "Old" Kilworth Heights, to the east, still relies on individual wells and septic tanks. "New" Kilworth Heights, to the west, receives water and septic services from Komoka. Recent residential development in the western part of Kilworth Heights is responsible for much of Middlesex Centre's population growth.
<a name="text31"></a><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>Middlesex Centre lies among "Tornado Alley" in Canada. As such, it experiences  severe weather annually. In 1990, the Komoka Community Church, which lies halfway between Komoka and Kilworth Heights, was destroyed down to the foundation by an F2 tornado.
