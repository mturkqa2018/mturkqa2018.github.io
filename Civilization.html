<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_the_concept">History of the concept</span></h2>
<p>The English word <i>civilization</i> comes from the 16th-century French</a> <i>civilisé</i> ("civilized"), from Latin <i>civilis</i> ("civil"), related to <i>civis</i> ("citizen") and <i>civitas</i> ("city").<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias</a>'s <i>The Civilizing Process</a></i> (1939), which traces social mores</a> from medieval courtly society</a> to the Early Modern period</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> In <i>The Philosophy of Civilization</i> (1923), Albert Schweitzer</a> outlines two opinions: one purely material</a> and the other material and ethical</a>. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, "the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears. (October 2014)">page&#160;needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Adjectives like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun "civilization", meaning "civilized condition", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau</a>, and the first use in English is attributed to Adam Ferguson</a>, who in his 1767 <i>Essay on the History of Civil Society</a></i> wrote, "Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation".<sup id="cite_ref-Benveniste_14-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of progress</a> characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution</a>, "civilization" was used in the singular</a>, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French.<sup id="cite_ref-velkley_15-0" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The use of "civilizations" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture</a> (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of ethnography</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau</a>, particularly his work about education, <i>Emile</a></i>. Here, civilization, being more rational</a> and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature</a>, and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity" (see noble savage</a>). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder</a>, and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard</a> and Nietzsche</a>. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by "conscious, rational, deliberative acts", but a kind of pre-rational "folk spirit". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to "vices of social life" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.<sup id="cite_ref-velkley_15-1" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In World War II</a>, Leo Strauss</a>, having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism</a> and German militarism</a> and nihilism</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Social scientists such as V. Gordon Childe</a> have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood</a>, settlement</a> patterns, forms of government</a>, social stratification</a>, economic systems, literacy</a> and other cultural traits. Andrew Nikiforuk</a> argues that "civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>All civilizations have depended on agriculture</a> for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru</a> which may have depended upon maritime resources.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization</a>, irrigation</a> and crop rotation</a>. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Grain</a> surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored</a> for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers</a>, artisans</a>, priests</a> and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest</a> and perhaps during the Mesolithic</a> Natufian culture</a>. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word "civilization" is sometimes simply defined as "'<i>living in cities</i>'".<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the state</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> State societies are more stratified<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The ruling class</a>, normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government</a> or bureaucracy</a>. Morton Fried</a>, a conflict theorist</a> and Elman Service</a>, an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality</a>. This system of classification contains four categories<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<ul><li><i>Hunter-gatherer</a> bands</i>, which are generally egalitarian</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><i>Horticultural</a>/pastoral</a> societies</i> in which there are generally two inherited social classes; chief and commoner.</li>
<li><i>Highly stratified structures</i>, or chiefdoms</a>, with several inherited social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave.</li>
<li><i>Civilizations,</i> with complex social hierarchies</a> and organized, institutional governments</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions</a> than nomadic people. Some people also acquire landed property</a>, or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must trade</a> their goods and services for food in a market</a> system, or receive food through the levy of tribute</a>, redistributive taxation</a>, tariffs</a> or tithes</a> from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy</a> supplemented by limited barter</a> systems. By the early Iron Age</a>, contemporary civilizations developed money</a> as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Writing</a>, developed first by people in Sumer</a>, is considered a hallmark of civilization and "appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state".<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown the Inca</a> civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the "Quipus", whose still functioned as a civilized society.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized religion</a>, development in the arts</a>, and countless new advances in science</a> and technology</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some "primitive</a>", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. "Primitive" implies in some way that a culture is "first" (Latin = <i>primus</i>), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term "non-literate</a>" to describe these peoples.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Civilization has been spread by colonization</a>, invasion</a>, religious conversion</a>, the extension of bureaucratic control</a> and trade</a>, and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour</a>, and the carrying capacity of its urban centres</a>. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and tort</a>-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy</a>, political structures and organized religion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Traditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as "civilized" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence—calling the latter barbarians</a>, savages</a>, and primitives</a>. In a modern-day context, "civilized people" have been contrasted with indigenous people</a> or tribal societies</a>.

<p>"Civilization" can also refer to the culture</a> of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state</a>-based decision making</a> apparatus, a literature</a>, professional art</a>, architecture</a>, organized religion</a> and complex customs of education</a>, coercion</a> and control associated with maintaining the elite.

Huntington</a></div></div></div>
<p>The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being Chinese</a> civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea</a>, Japan</a> and Vietnam</a>). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Spengler,_Oswald_1919_32-0" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> uses the German word <i>Kultur</i>, "culture", for what many call a "civilization". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".<sup id="cite_ref-Spengler,_Oswald_1919_32-1" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>This "unified culture" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian Arnold J. Toynbee</a> in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume <i>A Study of History</a>,</i> which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five "arrested civilizations". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Samuel P. Huntington</a> defines civilization as "the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed below</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Complex_systems">Complex systems</span></h2>
<p>Another group of theorists, making use of systems theory</a>, looks at a civilization as a complex system</a>, i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex social system</a> and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road</a> through Central Asia</a> and Indian Ocean</a> sea routes linking the Roman Empire</a>, Persian Empire</a>, India</a> and China</a>, were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the ancient world</a>. During the Uruk period</a>, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Resin found later in the Royal Cemetery at Ur</a> is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single "world system</a>", a process known as globalization</a>. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. David Wilkinson</a> has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian</a> and Egyptian</a> civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the "Central Civilization" around 1500 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the "clash of civilizations" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the Crusades</a> as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times</a>, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">See also: History of the world</a></div>
<p>The notion of world history</a> as a succession of "civilizations" is an entirely modern one.
In the European Age of Discovery</a>, emerging Modernity</a> was put into stark contrast with the
Neolithic</a> and Mesolithic</a>  stage of the cultures of the New World</a>, suggesting 
that the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> 
The term "civilization" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the Fertile Crescent</a> in the Early Bronze Age</a>, around roughly 3000 BC.
Gordon Childe</a> defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the Neolithic Revolution</a>, triggering the development of settled communities, and the Urban Revolution</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Urban_Revolution">Urban Revolution</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: Neolithic</a>, Bronze Age</a>, and Cradle of Civilization</a></div>
<p>At first, the Neolithic</a> was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly. 
This encouraged a secondary products revolution</a> in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts—a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>The earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in Western Asia (for example at Göbekli Tepe</a>, from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the Yellow River</a> and Yangtze</a> basins in China (for example the Pengtoushan</a> culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread. 
Mesopotamia</a> is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history</a> including the invention of the wheel</a>, the development of cuneiform</a> script, mathematics</a>, astronomy</a> and agriculture</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-historyandpolicy_37-0" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>
Similar pre-civilized "neolithic revolutions" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern South America</a> (the Norte Chico civilization</a>)<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> and Mesoamerica</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>This "urban revolution</a>" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferrable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism</a>, the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale</a> and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist Chalcolithic</a> civilizations began to rise in various "cradles"</a> from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale empires</a> in the course of the Bronze Age (Old Kingdom of Egypt</a>, Akkadian Empire</a>, Assyrian Empire</a>, Old Assyrian Empire</a>, Hittite Empire</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>A parallel development took place independently in the Pre-Columbian Americas</a>, where the Mayans</a> began to be urbanised</a> around 500 BCE, and the fully fledged Aztec</a> and Inca</a> emerged by the 15th century, briefly before European contact.

<p>Civilizations have generally ended in one of two ways; either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form, as happens in what are called Dark Ages.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p>
<ul><li>Ibn Khaldūn</a>'s <i>Muqaddimah</a></i> influenced theories of the analysis, growth and decline of the Islamic civilization.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.</li>
<li>Edward Gibbon</a>'s work <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a></i> was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of Constantinople</a> to the Ottoman Turks</a> in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long".<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Theodor Mommsen</a> in his <i>History of Rome</a></i> suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire</a> in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".</li>
<li>Oswald Spengler</a>, in his <i>Decline of the West</a></i> rejected Petrarch</a>'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight "mature civilizations". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in plutocracy</a> and ultimately imperialism</a>.</li>
<li>Arnold J. Toynbee</a> in his <i>A Study of History</a></i> suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural elite</a> became a parasitic</a> elite, leading to the rise of internal and external proletariats</a>.</li>
<li>Joseph Tainter</a> in <i>The Collapse of Complex Societies</a></i> suggested that there were diminishing returns</a> to complexity</a>, due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE.</li>
<li>Jared Diamond</a> in his 2005 book <i>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</a></i> suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as deforestation</a> and soil erosion</a>; climate change</a>; dependence upon long-distance trade</a> for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.</li>
<li>Peter Turchin</a> in his <i>Historical Dynamics</i></a> and Andrey Korotayev</a> <i>et al.</i> in their <i>Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends</i></a> suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's "fiscal-demographic" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic cycle</a> we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high population growth</a> rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing overpopulation</a> leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. <i>Historical Dynamics.</i> Princeton University Press</a>, 2003:121–127; Andrey Korotayev</a> et al. Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, 2006</a>).</li>
<li>Peter Heather</a> argues in his book <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a much more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the Han</a> and Tang</a> dynasties of China, to the Muslim Abbasid Caliphate</a> and others.</li>
<li>Bryan Ward-Perkins</a>, in his book <i>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar Dark Age</a> collapses are seen with the Late Bronze Age collapse</a> in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the Maya</a>, on Easter Island</a> and elsewhere.</li>
<li>Arthur Demarest</a> argues in <i>Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, paleoecology</a>, and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.</li>
<li>Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that "a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to over-exploit</a> their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society".<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Thomas Homer-Dixon</a> in <i>The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization</i></a>, where he considers that the fall in the energy return on investments</a>. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.</li>
<li>Feliks Koneczny</a> in his work "On the Plurality of Civilizations"  calls his study the science on civilizations. Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a "biological" life span. There still exist two ancient civilizations—Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese—which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that "a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways" without falling into what he calls an "abcivilized state" (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own "method of organizing social life" upon the other.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> Absorbing alien "method of organizing social life" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition.</li></ul>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Cultural Historian Morris Berman</a> suggests in <i>Dark Ages America: the End of Empire</i> that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup>  Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs</a> who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Some environmental scientists also see the world entering a Planetary Phase of Civilization</a>, characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the Global scenario group</a> used scenario analysis</a> to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented Eco-Communalism</a> movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new sustainability</a> paradigm.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Cultural critic</a> and author Derrick Jensen</a> argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as "a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities", with "cities" defined as "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life".<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>The Kardashev scale</a> classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist (see also: Civilizations and the Future</a> and Space civilization</a>).
