<p><b>Klay Alexander Thompson</b> (born February 8, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The son of former NBA player Mychal Thompson, he played college basketball for three seasons with the Washington State Cougars, where he was a two-time first-team all-conference selection in the Pac-10. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Thompson was selected in the first round of the 2011 NBA draft by Golden State with the 11th overall pick. In 2014, he and teammate Stephen Curry set a then NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season, earning the pair the nickname the "Splash Brothers". Thompson is a four-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Third Team honoree, and a three-time NBA champion. In 2015, he helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA Championship since 1975, and was a key contributor in the Warriors' 2017 and 2018 titles.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="High_school_career">High school career</span></h2>
<p>Thompson was born in Los Angeles to Julie and Mychal Thompson. His mother was a volleyball player in college, and his dad was the first overall pick of the 1978 NBA draft. When Thompson was two, he and his family moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Kevin Love. At age 14, the Thompsons moved to Ladera Ranch, California, where Klay graduated from Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita in 2008. In his junior season he was named to the All-Area second team and to the Orange County third team. As a senior Thompson averaged 21 points per game and led SMCHS to a 30–5 record and a Division III State Championship appearance. During the state championship, Thompson set a state finals record with seven 3-pointers in a game. He was named Division III State player of the year, League MVP, first-team Best in the West, and an EA Sports Second Team All American.

<p>Thompson declared for the 2011 NBA draft after his junior season, being selected 11th overall by the Golden State Warriors. This pick of a guard prompted speculation that the Warriors would trade starter Monta Ellis. Warriors general manager Larry Riley praised Thompson for his shooting ability and expressed confidence that Thompson would improve his defensive skills with new coach Mark Jackson.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The NBA did not select Thompson for the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend Rising Stars Challenge. However, in the four games after that decision, Thompson improved in all areas of basketball over his current season averages: points per game (12.5 over 7.6), shooting percentage (54.3% overall including 55.6% for three-pointers, up from 46.7 and 48.1), rebounds (2.8 from 1.6), assists (1.5 from 1.3), steals, and turnovers. The Warriors traded Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks on March 13, 2012. The following game, Thompson scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics. A week later, he exceeded his previous high with 27 points in a win over the New Orleans Hornets. As of mid-February 2012, Thompson played around 17 minutes per game, but he played an average 30 minutes per game during the next month. At the end of the season, Thompson was voted to the NBA NBA All-Rookie First Team.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="National_team_career">National team career</span></h2>
<p>Thompson was a member of the United States national team that won the gold medal at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. He also won gold as a member of the Under-19 national team at the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Player_profile">Player profile</span></h2>
<p>Thompson is both a prolific and efficient shooter, particularly from range, as well as an elite free-throw shooter. He relies upon a shooting form that has been described as "textbook" and "picture-perfect". Though he is capable of handling the ball in the Warriors offense, Thompson is primarily a catch-and-shoot player, taking advantage of back-cuts and screens set by teammates to make space for his exceptionally accurate quick-release shot.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Although Thompson isn't known for blocking shots or creating steals, he is considered a strong defender thanks to his size at the guard position and ability to defend against both elite guards and wings. He is also praised for his stamina.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Thompson is also known for his quiet, laid-back personality, rarely showing emotion in or out of games. He is one of the few players in the NBA sponsored by Chinese shoe company Anta, signing a 10-year deal with it in 2016.

<p>Thompson, was born in Los Angeles, California, to former NBA player Mychal Thompson, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers and currently works in sports radio. Klay's mother is Julie Leslie, a college volleyball player with the University of Portland and University of San Francisco.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>His older brother, Mychel, played basketball for Pepperdine University and has played in the NBA Development League, most recently with the Santa Cruz Warriors, while his younger brother, Trayce, is a Major League Baseball player with the Chicago White Sox, after previous appearances with the Oakland Athletics and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Thompson faced controversy when he was suspended for his final regular season game at WSU after being issued a misdemeanor criminal citation for marijuana possession.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>After winning the NBA championship in 2015, Thompson and his father became the fourth father-son duo to win an NBA title, joining Matt Guokas, Sr. and Jr.; Rick and Brent Barry; and Bill and Luke Walton.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Thompson is known for his offbeat, dry sense of humor. He owns an English bulldog named Rocco.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>In late October 2017, Thompson participated in local efforts to raise money for relief for the October 2017 Northern California wildfires, donating $1,000 for every point he scored in home games against the Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors, and Detroit Pistons. With additional sponsor and fan matching Thompson was able to increase that to $5,223 per point, ultimately raising $360,374 by tallying 69 points across the three games. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Thompson is an avid chess player and has met with the chess world champion, Magnus Carlsen.
