<p>In cell biology</a>, the  <b>nucleus</b> (pl. <i><b>nuclei</b></i>; from Latin</a> <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">nucleus</i> or <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">nuculeus</i>, meaning <i>kernel</i> or <i>seed</i>) is a membrane</a>-enclosed organelle</a> found in eukaryotic</a> cells</a>. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei</a>, and a few others including osteoclasts</a> have many</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Cell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material</a>, organized as multiple long linear DNA</a> molecules in a complex</a> with a large variety of proteins</a>, such as histones</a>, to form chromosomes</a>. The genes</a> within these chromosomes</a> are the cell's nuclear genome</a> and are structured</a> in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression</a>—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope</a>, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm</a>, and the nuclear matrix</a> (which includes the nuclear lamina</a>), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton</a>, which supports the cell as a whole.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Because the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores</a> are required to regulate nuclear transport</a> of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel</a> through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions</a>. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA</a> through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of <i>sub-nuclear bodies</i> exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus</a>, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes</a>. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA</a>.

<p>The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</a> (1632–1723). He observed a "lumen", the nucleus, in the red blood cells</a> of salmon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer</a> in 1804<sup id="cite_ref-Harris_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist</a> Robert Brown</a> in a talk at the Linnean Society of London</a>. Brown was studying orchids</a> under microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the "areola" or "nucleus", in the cells of the flower's outer layer.<sup id="cite_ref-Robert_Brown_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, Matthias Schleiden</a> proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name "cytoblast" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around "cytoblasts". Franz Meyen</a> was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the "cytoblast" or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak</a> (1852) and Rudolf Virchow</a> (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells ("Omnis cellula e cellula"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.<sup id="cite_ref-Cremer_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Between 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig</a> published several studies on the fertilization</a> of sea urchin</a> eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm</a> enters the oocyte</a> and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel</a>'s theory that the complete phylogeny</a> of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a "monerula", a structureless mass of primordial mucus ("Urschleim"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians</a> and molluscs</a>. Eduard Strasburger</a> produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann</a> postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ <i>cells</i> for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis</a> was discovered and the Mendelian rules</a> were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity</a> was therefore developed.<sup id="cite_ref-Cremer_4-1" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structures">Structures</span></h2>
<p>The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle</a> in animal cells.<sup id="cite_ref-Lodish_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
In mammalian</a> cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres</a> (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.<sup id="cite_ref-MBoC_6-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm</a> (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol</a> found outside the nucleus.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In some types of white blood cells</a> specifically most granulocytes</a> the nucleus is lobated</a> and can be present as a bi-lobed, tri-lobed or multi-lobed organelle.

<p>The nuclear envelope</a>, otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes</a>, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres</a> (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules</a> from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.<sup id="cite_ref-Paine_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum</a> (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Paine_8-1" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Nuclear pores</a>, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins</a>. The pores are about 125 million daltons</a> in molecular weight</a> and consist of around 50 (in yeast</a>) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-Lodish_5-1" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The pores are 100&#160;nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9&#160;nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids</a> and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope,<sup id="cite_ref-Rhoades_9-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse.<sup id="cite_ref-Shulga_10-0" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Attached to the ring is a structure called the <i>nuclear basket</i> that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.<sup id="cite_ref-Lodish_5-2" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some DNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins</a>. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Pemberton_11-0" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Steroid hormones</a> such as cortisol</a> and aldosterone</a>, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling</a>, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor</a> proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors</a> when bound to their ligand</a>; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases</a> that repress gene expression.<sup id="cite_ref-Lodish_5-3" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Nuclear lamina</a></div>
<p>In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments</a> provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina</a> forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.<sup id="cite_ref-MBoC_6-1" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin</a> proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina.<sup id="cite_ref-Sturrman_12-0" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Goldman_13-0" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin</a> and nesprin</a>, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the <i>nucleoplasmic veil</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-RGoldman_14-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> that is visible using fluorescence microscopy</a>.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Like the components of other intermediate filaments</a>, the lamin monomer</a> contains an alpha-helical</a> domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer</a> structure called a coiled coil</a>. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel</a> arrangement, to form a tetramer</a> called a <i>protofilament</i>. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike <i>filament</i>. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.<sup id="cite_ref-MBoC_6-2" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as <i>laminopathies</a></i>.

<p>The nucleolus</a> is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a <i>suborganelle</i>. It forms around tandem</a> repeats of rDNA</a>, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA</a> (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions</a> (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes</a>. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.<sup id="cite_ref-Hernandez-Verdun_25-0" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In the first step of ribosome assembly,  a protein called RNA polymerase I</a> transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor.

Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Function">Function</span></h2>
<p>The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription</a> that is segregated from the location of translation</a> in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation</a> that are not available to prokaryotes</a>. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>The nucleus is an organelle</a> found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane</a>, it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA</a> molecules</a>, along with a variety of proteins</a>, to form chromosomes</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cell_compartmentalization">Cell compartmentalization</span></h3>
<p>The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis</a>, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose</a> to produce energy. Hexokinase</a> is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate</a> from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate</a>, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,<sup id="cite_ref-Lehninger_53-0" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.<sup id="cite_ref-Moreno_54-0" class="reference">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor</a> proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-κB</a>-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory</a> responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway</a> such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α</a>, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal</a> on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.<sup id="cite_ref-MBoC_6-3" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA.<sup id="cite_ref-Gorlich_55-0" class="reference">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns</a> that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Post-transcriptional modification</a></div>
<p>Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts</a> or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification</a> in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation</a>. The three main modifications are 5' capping</a>, 3' polyadenylation</a>, and RNA splicing</a>. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles</a> (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine</a> tail is only added after transcription is complete.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome</a>, is the process by which introns</a>, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons</a> connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons.<sup id="cite_ref-Lodish_5-5" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies</a>, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences</a>. This process is known as alternative splicing</a>, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.

<p>The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation,<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_58-0" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins</a> called importins</a> to enter the nucleus and exportins</a> to exit. "Cargo" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals</a>, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals</a> bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases</a>, enzymes that hydrolyze</a> the molecule guanosine triphosphate</a> (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran</a>, which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.<sup id="cite_ref-Pemberton_11-1" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation.

<p>During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division</a> or as a consequence of apoptosis</a> (the process of programmed cell death</a>). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus&#160;— the envelope and lamina&#160;— can be systematically degraded.
In most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase</a> of mitosis</a>. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis</a>, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis</a>, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>At a certain point during the cell cycle</a> in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids</a>, attaching to microtubules</a>, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes</a>. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.<sup id="cite_ref-Lippincott-Schwartz_59-0" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase</a> and until around prometaphase</a>, the nuclear membrane is dismantled.<sup id="cite_ref-RGoldman_14-1" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Boulikas_60-0" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.<sup id="cite_ref-Boulikas_60-1" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>However, in dinoflagellates</a>, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates</a>, sporozoans</a>) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>Apoptosis</a> is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases</a> called caspases</a>, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays</a> for early apoptotic activity.<sup id="cite_ref-RGoldman_14-2" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus.<sup id="cite_ref-RGoldman_14-3" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.<sup id="cite_ref-Steen_61-0" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p><p>The first model known as the "syntrophic model" proposes that a symbiotic</a> relationship between the archaea</a> and bacteria</a> created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup>) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic</a> archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria</a>, eventually forming the early nucleus.

One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis</a> to form an early cellular "predator</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-Bell_78-0" class="reference">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup> Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea</a> infected by poxviruses</a>, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases</a> in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes.<sup id="cite_ref-Takemura_79-0" class="reference">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Villareal_80-0" class="reference">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup> It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex</a> could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.<sup id="cite_ref-Bell2_81-0" class="reference">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup>
