<p><b>Ireland</b> is labelled a <b>tax haven</b> or <b>corporate tax haven</b>, which it rejects. Ireland's base erosion and profit shifting ("BEPS") tools give foreign corporates <i>§ Effective tax rates</i> of 0% to 3% on global profits re-routed to Ireland via Ireland's tax treaty network.  Ireland's <i>aggregate § Effective tax rates</i> for corporates is circa 2–4%.  Ireland's BEPS tools are the world's largest BEPS flows, exceed the entire Caribbean system, and artificially inflate the US–EU trade deficit.  Ireland's QIAIF &amp; L–QIAIF regimes, and Section 110 SPVs, enable foreign investors to avoid Irish taxes on Irish assets, and can be combined with Irish BEPS tools to create confidential routes out of the Irish corporate tax system.  As these structures are OECD–whitelisted, Ireland uses data protection, data privacy laws, and opt-outs from filing of public accounts, to obscure their effects. There is evidence Ireland acts as a § Captured state fostering tax avoidance strategies.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Ireland is on all academic "tax haven lists", including the § Leaders in tax haven research, and tax NGOs.  Ireland does not meet the 1998 OECD definition of a tax haven, but no OECD member, including Switzerland, has ever met this definition.  Only Trinidad &amp; Tobago met it in 2017.  Similarly, no EU–28 country is amongst the 64 listed in the 2017 EU tax haven blacklist and greylist.  In September 2016, Brazil became the first G20 country to "blacklist" Ireland as a tax haven.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Ireland's situation is attributed to § Political compromises arising from the historical U.S. "worldwide" corporate tax system, which has made U.S. multinationals the largest users of tax havens, and BEPS tools, in the world.  The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA"), and move to a hybrid "territorial" tax system, removed the need for some of these compromises.  In 2018, IP–heavy S&amp;P500 multinationals guided similar post–TCJA <i>effective</i> tax rates, whether they are legally based in the U.S. (e.g. Pfizer), or Ireland (e.g. Medtronic). While the TCJA neutralises some Irish BEPS tools, it enhances others (e.g. Apple's "Green Jersey").  A reliance on U.S. corporates (80% of Irish tax, 25% of Irish labour, 25 of top 50 Irish firms, and 57% of Irish value-add), is a concern in Ireland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Ireland's weakness in attracting corporates from "territorial" tax systems (<i>Table 1</i>), was apparent in its 2017–18 failure to attract London financial services jobs due to Brexit.   Ireland's diversification into full tax haven tools (e.g. QIAIF, L–QIAIF, and ICAV), has seen tax-law firms, and offshore magic circle firms, set up Irish offices to handle Brexit–driven tax restructuring. These tools made Ireland the world's 3rd largest Shadow Banking OFC, and 5th largest Conduit OFC.

<p>Ireland has been associated with the term "tax haven" since the U.S. IRS produced a list on the 12 January 1981.  Ireland has been a consistent feature on almost every non-governmental tax haven list from Hines in February 1994, to Zucman in June 2018 (and each one in-between).  However, Ireland has never been considered a tax haven by either the OECD or the EU Commission.  These two contrasting facts are used by various sides, to prove or disprove whether Ireland is a tax haven, and much of the detail in-between is discarded, some of which can explain the EU and OCED's position.  Confusing scenarios have emerged, for example:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<ul><li>In April 2000, the FSF–IMF listed Ireland as an offshore financial centre ("OFC"), based on criteria which academics and the OECD support. The Irish State has never refuted the OFC label, and there are Irish State documents that note Ireland as an OFC.  Yet, the terms OFC and "tax haven" are considered synonymous.</li>
<li>In December 2017, the EU did not consider Ireland to be a tax haven, and Ireland is not in the § EU 2017 tax haven lists; in January 2017 the EU Commissioner for Taxation, Pierre Moscovici, stated this publicly.  However, the same Commissioner in January 2018, described Ireland to the EU Parliament as a <i>tax black hole</i>.</li>
<li>In September 2018, the 29th Chair of the U.S. President's Council of Economic Advisors, tax-expert Kevin Hassett, said that: "It’s not Ireland’s fault U.S. tax law was written by someone on acid".  Hassett, however, had labeled Ireland as a tax haven in November 2017, when advocating for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA").</li></ul>
<p>The next sections chronicle the detail regarding Ireland's label as a tax haven (most cited <i>Sources</i> and <i>Evidence</i>), and detail regarding the Irish State's official <i>Rebuttals</i> of the label (both technical and non-technical).  The final section chronicles the academic research on the drivers of U.S., EU, and OCED, decision making regarding Ireland.

<p>Ireland ranks in all non-political "tax haven lists" going back to the first lists in 1994, and features in all "proxy tests" for tax havens and "quantitative measures" of tax havens.  The level of base erosion and profit shifting ("BEPS") by U.S. multinationals in Ireland is so large, that in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland abandoned GDP/GNP as a statistic to replace it with Modified gross national income (GNI*).  Economists note that Ireland's distorted GDP is now distorting the EU's aggregate GDP, and has artificially inflated the trade-deficit between the EU and the US. (see <i>Table 1</i>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Ireland's IP–based BEPS tools use "intellectual property" ("IP") to "shift profits" from higher-tax locations, with whom Ireland has bilateral tax treaties, back to Ireland.  Once in Ireland, these tools reduce Irish corporate taxes by re-routing to say Bermuda with the <b>Double Irish</b> BEPS tool (e.g. as Google and Facebook did), or to Malta with the <b>Single Malt</b> BEPS tool (e.g. as Microsoft and Allergan did), or by writing-off internally created virtual assets against Irish corporate tax with the <b>Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets</b> ("CAIA") BEPS tool (e.g. as Apple did post 2015).  These BEPS tools give an Irish corporate <i>effective tax rate</i> (ETR) of 0–3%.  They are the world's largest BEPS tools, and exceed the aggregate flows of the Caribbean tax system.

<p>Ireland has received the most U.S. corporate tax inversions of any global jurisdiction, or tax haven, since the first U.S. tax inversion in 1982.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>While IP–based BEPS tools are the majority of Irish BEPS flows, they were developed from Ireland's traditional expertise in inter-group contract manufacturing, or transfer pricing–based ("TP") BEPS tools (e.g. capital allowance schemes, inter-group cross-border charging), which still provide material employment in Ireland (e.g. from U.S. life sciences firms).  Some corporates like Apple maintain expensive Irish contract manufacturing TP–based BEPS operations (versus  cheaper options in Asia, like Apple's Foxconn), to give "substance" to their larger Irish IP–based BEPS tools.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>By refusing to implement the 2013 EU Accounting Directive (and invoking exemptions on reporting holding company structures until 2022), Ireland enables their TP and IP–based BEPS tools to structure as "unlimited liability companies" ("ULC") which do not have to file public accounts with the Irish CRO.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Ireland's Debt–based BEPS tools (e.g. the Section 110 SPV), have made Ireland the 3rd largest global Shadow Banking OFC, and have been used by Russian banks to circumvent sanctions. Irish Section 110 SPVs offer "orphaning" to protect the identity of the owner, and to shield the owner from Irish tax (the Section 110 SPV is an Irish company).  They were used by U.S. distressed debt funds to avoid billions in Irish taxes, assisted by Irish tax-law firms using in-house Irish children's charities to complete the orphan structure, that enabled the U.S. distressed debt funds to export the gains on their Irish assets, free of any Irish taxes or duties, to Luxembourg and the Caribbean (see Section 110 abuse).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Unlike the TP and IP–based BEPS tools, Section 110 SPVs must file public accounts with the Irish CRO, which was how the above abuses were discovered in 2016–17. In February 2018 the Central Bank of Ireland upgraded the little-used L–QIAIF regime to give the same tax benefits as Section 110 SPVs but without having to file public accounts. In June 2018, the Central Bank reported that €55 billion of U.S.–owned distressed Irish assets, equivalent to 25% of Irish GNI*, moved out of Irish Section 110 SPVs and into L–QIAIFs.

<p>Apple's Q1 2015 Irish restructure, post their €13 billion EU tax fine for 2004–2014, is one of the most advanced OECD-compliant BEPS tools in the world. It integrates Irish IP–based BEPS tools, and Jersey Debt–based BEPS tools, to materially amplify the tax sheltering effects, by a factor of circa 2.  Apple Ireland bought circa $300 billion of a "virtual" IP–asset from Apple Jersey in Q1 2015 (see leprechaun economics).  The Irish "capital allowances for intangible assets" ("CAIA") BEPS tool allows Apple Ireland to write-off this virtual IP–asset against future Irish corporation tax.  The €26.220 billion jump in intangible capital allowances claimed in 2015,  showed Apple Ireland is writing-off this IP–asset over a 10–year period.  In addition, Apple Jersey gave Apple Ireland the $300 billion "virtual" loan to buy this virtual IP–asset from Apple Jersey. Thus, Apple Ireland can claim additional Irish corporation tax relief on this loan interest, which is circa $20 billion per annum (Apple Jersey pays no tax on the loan interest it receives from Apple Ireland).  These tools, created entirely from virtual internal assets financed by virtual internal loans, give Apple circa €45 billion per annum in relief against Irish corporation tax.  In June 2018 it was shown that Microsoft is preparing to copy this Apple scheme, known as "the Green Jersey".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>As the IP is a virtual internal asset, it can be replenished with each technology (or life sciences) product cycle (e.g. new virtual IP assets created offshore and then bought by the Irish subsidiary, with internal virtual loans, for higher prices).  The Green Jersey thus gives a perpetual BEPS tool, like the double Irish, but at a much greater scale than the double Irish, as the full BEPS effect is capitalized on day one.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Experts expect the U.S Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") GILTI-regime to neutralise some Irish BEPS tools, including the single malt and the double Irish.  Because Irish intangible capital allowances are accepted as U.S. GILTI deductions, the "Green Jersey" now enables U.S. multinationals to achieve net effective <i>U.S. corporate tax rates</i> of 0% to 3% via TCJA's participation relief. As Microsoft's main Irish BEPS tools are the single malt and the double Irish, in June 2018, Microsoft was preparing a "Green Jersey" Irish BEPS scheme.  Irish experts, including Seamus Coffey, Chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and author of the Irish State's 2017 <i>Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code</i>, expects a boom in U.S. on-shoring of virtual internal IP assets to Ireland, via the Green Jersey BEPS tool (e.g. under the capital allowances for intangible assets scheme).

<p>Ireland's Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund ("QIAIF") regime is a range of five tax-free legal wrappers (ICAV, Investment Company, Unit Trust, Common Contractual Fund, Investment Limited Partnership).  Four of the five wrappers do not file public accounts with the Irish CRO, and therefore offer tax confidentiality and tax secrecy.  While they are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, like the Section 110 SPV, it has been shown many are effectively unregulated "brass plate" entities. The Central Bank has no mandate to investigate tax avoidance or tax evasion, and under the 1942 <i>Central Bank Secrecy Act</i>, the Central Bank of Ireland cannot send the confidential information which QIAIFs must file with the Bank to the Irish Revenue.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>QIAIFs have been used in tax avoidance on Irish assets, on circumventing international regulations,  on avoiding tax laws in the EU and the U.S.  QIAIFs can be combined with Irish corporate BEPS tools (e.g.  the Orphaned Super–QIF), to create routes out of the Irish corporate tax system to Luxembourg, the main Sink OFC for Ireland. It is asserted that a material amount of assets in Irish QIAIFs, and the ICAV wrapper in particular, are Irish assets being shielded from Irish taxation. Offshore magic circle law firms (e.g. Walkers and Maples and Calder, who have set up offices in Ireland), market the Irish ICAV as a superior wrapper to the Cayman SPC (Maples and Calder claim to be a major architect of the ICAV), and there are explicit QIAIF rules to help with re-domiciling of Cayman/BVI funds into Irish ICAVs.

<p>There is evidence Ireland meets the <b>captured state</b> criteria for tax havens.  When the EU investigated Apple in Ireland in 2016 they found private tax rulings from the Irish Revenue giving Apple a tax rate of 0.005% on +€100 billion of profits.  When the Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan was alerted by an Irish MEP in 2016 to a new Irish BEPS tool to replace the double Irish (called the single malt), he was told to "put on the green jersey".  When Apple executed the largest BEPS transaction in history in Q1 2015 (see "leprechaun economics"), the Central Statistics Office suppressed data to hide Apple's identity.  Noonan changed the capital allowances for intangible assets scheme rules, the IP–based BEPS tool Apple used in Q1 2015, to reduce Apple's effective tax rate from 2.5% to 0%.  When it was discovered in 2016 that U.S. distressed debt funds abused Section 110 SPVs to shield €80 billion in Irish loan balances from Irish taxes, the Irish State did not investigate or prosecute (see Section 110 abuse).  In February 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland, who regulates Section 110 SPVs, upgraded the little used L-QIAIF tax-free regime, which has stronger privacy from public scrutiny.  In June 2018, U.S. distressed debt funds transferred €55 billion of Irish assets (25% of Irish GNI*), out of Section 110 SPVs and into L–QIAIFs.

<p>Tax haven investigator Nicholas Shaxson documents how Ireland's captured state uses a complex, and "siloed", network of Irish privacy and Irish data protection laws to navigate around the fact that most of its tax tools are OECD–whitelisted, and therefore must be transparent to some State entity.  For example, Irish QIAIFs (and L–QIAIFs) are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland and must provide the Bank with details of their financials.  However, the 1942 <i>Central Bank Secrecy Act</i> prevents the Central Bank from sending this data to the Revenue Commissioners.  Similarly, the Central Statistics Office (Ireland) stated it had to restrict its public data release in 2016–17 to protect the Apple's identity during its 2015 BEPS action, because the 1993 <i>Central Statistics Act</i> prohibits use of economic data for revealing such activities.  When the EU Commission fined Apple €13 billion for illegal State aid in 2016, there were no official records of any discussion of the tax deal given to Apple outside of the Irish Revenue Commissioners because such data is also protected.  When Tim Cook stated in 2016 that Apple was the largest tax-payer in Ireland, the Irish Revenue Commissioners quoted Section 815A of the 1997 Tax Acts that prevents them disclosing such information, even to members of Dail Eireann, or the Irish Department of Finance (despite the fact that Apple is circa one-fifth of Ireland's GDP).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Commentators note the "plausible deniability" provided by Irish privacy and data protection laws, that enable the State to function as a tax haven while maintaining OECD compliance.

<p>Two of the world's main § Leaders in tax haven research, estimated Ireland's <i>effective corporate tax rate</i> to be 4%: James R.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>The disconnect between the ETR of 12.5% claimed by the Irish State and its advisors, and the actual ETRs of 2.2–4.5% calculated by independent experts, is because the Irish tax code considers a high percentage of Irish income as not being subject to Irish taxation, due to various exclusions and deductions.  The gap of 12.5% vs. 2–4% implies that well over two-thirds of corporate profits booked in Ireland are excluded from Irish corporate taxation (see Irish ETR).

<p>EU and U.S. studies that attempted to find a consensus on the definition of a tax haven,  have concluded that there is no consensus (see tax haven definitions).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>The Irish State, and its advisors, have refuted the tax haven label by invoking the 1998 OCED definition of a "tax haven" as the consensus definition:

<p>Most Irish BEPS tools and QIAIFs are OECD–whitelisted (and can thus avail of Ireland's 70 bilateral tax treaties), and therefore while Ireland could meet the first OECD test, it fails the second and third OECD tests.  The fourth OECD test (‡) was withdrawn by the OECD in 2002 on protest from the U.S., which indicates is a political dimension to the definition.  In 2017, only one jurisdiction, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, met the 1998 OECD definition of a tax haven (Trinidad &amp; Tobago is not one of the 35 OECD member countries), and the definition has fallen into disrepute.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Tax haven academic James R. Hines Jr. notes that OECD tax haven lists never include the 35 OECD member countries (Ireland is a founding OECD member).  The OECD definition was produced in 1998 as part of the OECD's investigation into <i>Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue</i>.  By 2000, when the OECD published their first list of 35 tax havens,  it included no OECD member countries as they were now all considered to have engaged in the OECD's Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (see § External links).  Because the OECD has never listed any of its 35 members as tax havens, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland are sometimes referred to as the "OECD tax havens".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Subsequent definitions of tax haven, and/or offshore financial centre/corporate tax haven (see definition of a "tax haven"), focus on effective taxes as the primary requirement, which Ireland would meet, and have entered the general lexicon.  The Tax Justice Network, who places Ireland on its tax haven list, split the concept of <i>tax rates</i> from <i>tax transparency</i> by defining a <b>secrecy jurisdiction</b> and creating the Financial Secrecy Index.  The OECD has never updated or amended its 1998 definition (apart from dropping the 4th criteria).  The Tax Justice Network imply the U.S. may be the reason.

Hines Jr. testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on Corporate Taxation in 2016.  Hines is the most cited academic on research into tax havens; and his 1994 Hines–Rice paper, the most cited paper in all tax haven research, was relied upon by the Council of Economic Advisors in October 2017 when advocating the corporate tax cuts proposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.</div></div></div>
<p>The first major § Leaders in tax haven research was James R. Hines Jr., who in 1994, published a paper with Eric M Rice, listing 41 tax havens, of which Ireland was one of their <i>major 7 tax havens</i>.  The 1994 Hines–Rice paper is recognised as the first important paper on tax havens, and is the most cited paper in the history of research on tax havens.  The paper has been cited by all subsequent, <i>most cited</i>, research papers on tax havens, by other § Leaders in tax haven research, including Desai, Dharmapala, Slemrod, and Zucman.  Hines expanded his original 1994 list to 45 countries in 2007, and to 52 countries in the Hines 2010 list, and used quantitative techniques to estimate that Ireland was the third largest global tax haven.  Other major papers on tax havens by Dharmapala (2008, 2009), and Zucman (2015, 2018), cite the 1994 Hines–Rice paper, but create their own tax haven lists, all of which include Ireland (e.g., the June 2018, Zucman–Tørsløv–Wier 2018 list).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>The 1994 Hines–Rice paper was one of the first to use the term<i> "profit shifting"</i>.  Hines–Rice also introduced the first quantitative tests of a tax haven, which Hines felt were needed as many tax havens had non-trivial "headline" tax rates.  These two tests are still the most widely quoted proxy tests for tax havens in the academic literature. The first test, extreme distortion of national accounts by BEPS accounting flows, was used by the IMF in June 2000 when defining offshore financial centres ("OFCs"), a term the IMF used to capture both traditional tax havens and emerging modern corporate tax havens:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p>
<div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li>Distortion of GDP/GNP.  BEPS flows inflate the haven's GDP; proxies are GDP-per-capita (Ireland is 3rd), and deviation of GDP/GNI from 1 (Ireland is now 1st).</li><li>Hyper–profitability of foreign multinationals.  Profit shifting inflates profitability in the tax haven; the proxy is the GAAP profits of foreign companies.</li></ol></div>
<p>The Hines–Rice paper showed that <i>low foreign tax rates [from tax havens] ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections</i>.  Hines' insight that the U.S. is the largest beneficiary from tax havens was confirmed by others, and dictated U.S. policy towards tax havens, including the 1996 "check-the-box" rules, and U.S. hostility to OECD attempts in curbing Ireland's BEPS tools.  Under the 2017 U.S. TCJA, U.S. multinationals paid a 15.5% repatriation tax on the circa $1 trillion in untaxed cash built up in global tax havens from 2004–2017.  Had these U.S. multinationals paid foreign taxes, they would have built up sufficient foreign tax credits to avoid paying U.S. taxes.  By allowing U.S. multinationals to use global tax havens, the U.S. exchequer received more taxes, at the expense of other countries, as Hines predicted in 1994.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Several of Hines' papers on tax havens, including the calculations of the Hines–Rice 1994 paper, were used in the final report by the U.S. President's Council of Economic Advisors that justified the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the largest U.S. tax reform in a generation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>The Irish State dismisses academic studies which list Ireland as a tax haven as being "out-of-date", because they cite the 1994 Hines–Rice paper.  The Irish State ignores the fact that both Hines, and all the other academics, developed new lists; or that the Hines–Rice 1994 paper is still considered correct (e.g. per the 2017 U.S. TCJA legislation).  In 2013, the Department of Finance (Ireland) co-wrote a paper with the Irish Revenue Commissioners, which they had published in the State-sponsored ESRI Quarterly, which found the only sources listing Ireland as a tax haven were:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p>
<div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li>"First, because of Ireland's 12.5 percent corporation tax rate"; (see § Effective tax rates)</li><li>"Second, the role of the International Financial Services Centre in attracting investment to Ireland" (this is effectively also linked to § Effective tax rates);</li><li>"Third, because of a rather obscure, but nonetheless influential paper by Hines and Rice dating back to 1994."</li></ol></div>
<p>This 2013 Irish State-written paper then invoked the § OECD 1998 definition of a tax haven, four years younger than Hines–Rice, and since discredited, to show that Ireland was not a tax haven.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>The following is from a June 2018 Irish Independent article by the CEO of the key trade body that represents all U.S. multinationals in Ireland on the 1994 Hines–Rice paper:

<p>In a less technical manner to the rebuttals by the Irish State, the labels have also drawn responses from leaders in the Irish business community who attribute the value of U.S. investment in Ireland to Ireland's unique talent base. At €334 billion, the value of U.S. investment in Ireland is larger than Ireland's 2016 GDP of €291 billion (or 2016 GNI* of €190 billion), and larger than total <i>aggregate</i> U.S. investment into all BRIC countries.  This unique talent base is also noted by IDA Ireland, the State body responsible for attracting inward investment, but never defined beyond the broad concept.

<p>Ireland has no university in the top 100. Irish education does not appear to be distinctive.  Ireland has a high % of third-level graduates, but this is because it re-classified many technical colleges into degree-issuing institutions in 2005-08.  This is believed to have contributed to the decline of its leading universities, of which there are barely two left in the top 200 (i.e. a quality over quantity issue).  Ireland continues to pursue this strategy and is considering re-classifying the remaining Irish technical institutes as universities for 2019.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>Ireland shows no apparent distinctiveness in any non-tax related metrics of business competitiveness including cost of living, league tables of favoured EU FDI locations, league tables of favoured EU destinations for London-based financials post–Brexit (which are linked to quality of talent), and the key World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report rankings.

<p><span id="Employment_Tax_BEPS_system"></span>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>Irish commentators provide a perspective on Ireland's "talent base".  The State applies an "employment tax" to U.S. multinationals using Irish BEPs tools.  To fulfil their Irish employment quotas, some U.S. technology firms perform low-grade localisation functions in Ireland which requires foreign employees speaking global languages (while many U.S. multinationals perform higher-value software engineering functions in Ireland, some do not).  These employees must be sourced internationally. This is facilitated via a loose Irish work-visa program.  This Irish "employment tax" requirement for use of BEPS tools, and its fulfilment via foreign work-visas, is a driver of Dublin's housing crisis.  This is consistent with a bias to property development-led economic growth, favored by the main Irish political parties (see Abuse of QIAIFs).

<p>In another less technical rebuttal, the State explains Ireland's high ranking in the established "proxy tests" for tax havens as a by–product of Ireland's position as preferred hub for global "knowledge economy" multinationals (e.g. technology and life sciences), "selling into EU–28 markets".  When the Central Statistics Office (Ireland) suppressed its 2016-2017 data release to protect Apple's Q1 2015 BEPS action (i.e. leprechaun economics), it released a paper on "meeting the challenges of a modern globalised knowledge economy".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>Ireland has no non–U.S./non–UK multinationals in its top 50 companies by revenue, and only one by employees (German retailer Lidl who sells into Ireland).  The UK multinationals in Ireland are either selling into Ireland (e.g. Tesco), or date pre–2009, after which the UK overhauled its tax system to a "territorial tax" model.  Since 2009, the U.K has become a corporate tax haven (see U.K. transformation). Since this transformation, no major UK firms have moved to Ireland and most UK corporate tax inversions to Ireland returned; and Ireland has failed to win Brexit financial services firms.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>In 2016, U.S. corporate tax expert, James R. Hines Jr., showed multinationals from "territorial" corporate taxation systems don't need tax havens, when researching behaviours of German multinationals with German academic tax experts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>U.S.–controlled multinationals are 25 of the top 50 Irish firms (including tax inversions), and 70% of top 50 revenue (see <i>Table 1</i>). U.S.–controlled multinations pay 80% of Irish corporate taxes (see "low tax economy").  Irish–based U.S. multinationals may be selling into Europe, however, the evidence is that they route all non–U.S. business through Ireland.  Ireland is more accurately described as a "U.S. corporate tax haven".  The U.S. multinationals in Ireland are from "knowledge industries" (see <i>Table 1</i>).  This is because Ireland's BEPS tools (e.g. the double Irish, the single malt and the capital allowances for intangible assets) require intellectual property ("IP") to execute the BEPS actions, which technology and life sciences possess in quantity (see IP–Based BEPS tools).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Rather than a "global knowledge hub" for "selling into Europe", Ireland is a base for U.S. multinationals, with sufficient IP to use Ireland's BEPS tools, to shield non–U.S. revenues from U.S. taxation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p> No other non-haven OECD country records as high a share of foreign profits booked in tax havens as the United States. [...] This suggests that half of all the global profits shifted to tax havens

By contrast, about 25% accrues to E.U. countries, 10% to the rest of the OECD, and 15% to developing countries (Tørsløv et al., 2018).<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><div class="templatequotecite">— <cite>Gabriel Zucman, Thomas Wright, "THE EXORBITANT TAX PRIVILEGE", NBER Working Papers (September 2018).</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018, the U.S. converted into a hybrid "territorial" tax system (the U.S. was one of the last remaining pure "worldwide" tax systems).  Post this conversion, U.S. <i>effective</i> tax rates for IP–heavy U.S. multinationals are very similar to the <i>effective</i> tax rates they would incur if legally headquartered in Ireland, even net of full Irish BEPS tools like the double Irish. This represents a substantive challenge to the Irish economy (see effect of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).  However, § Technical issues with-TCJA mean some Irish BEPS tools, such as Apple's § Green Jersey, have been enhanced.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>Ireland's recent expansion into traditional tax haven services (e.g. Cayman Island and Luxembourg type ICAVs and L–QIAIFs) is a diversifier from U.S. corporate tax haven services. Brexit has been disappointing for Ireland in its failure to attract any London financial services firms, underlying Ireland's traditional weakness in non–U.S. corporates.  Brexit has led to growth in UK centric tax-law firms (including offshore magic circle firms), setting up offices in Ireland to handle traditional tax haven services for clients.

<p>While Ireland's development into traditional tax haven tools (e.g. ICAVs and L–QIAIFs) is more recent, Ireland's status as a corporate tax haven has been noted since 1994 (the first Hines–Rice tax haven paper), and discussed in the U.S. Congress for a decade.  A lack of progress, and delays, in addressing Ireland's corporate tax BEPS tools is apparent:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">70</span></p>
<div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li>Ireland's most famous BEPS tool, the double Irish, attributed to creating the largest build-up in untaxed cash in history, was documented in 2004.  The U.S. did not seek its closure, and it was the EU that forced Ireland to close the double Irish BEPS tool in October 2014, however, existing users such as Google and Facebook, were given a five–year delay to January 2020 before closure.</li><li>Ireland's replacement for the double Irish tool, the single malt, was already up and running in 2014 (and used by Microsoft and Allergan in 2017), and has as yet not received any US–EU–OECD attention.  It is noted that since the closure of the double Irish in 2015, the use of Irish BEPS tools increased materially;</li><li>The OECD, who is running a project since 2012 to stop global BEPS activities, has made no comment on Apple's Q1 2015 USD 300 billion Irish BEPS transaction, the largest BEPS transaction in history (labelled "leprechaun economics" by Noble Prize economist, Paul Krugman), with Ireland's expanded capital allowances for intangible assets ("CAIA") BEPS tool (the "Green Jersey");</li><li>The U.S. administration condemned Apple's Irish tax structures in the 2013 Levin–McCain PSI, however, it came to Apple's defense when the EU Commission levied a €13 billion fine on Apple for Irish tax avoidance from 2004–2014, the largest corporate tax fine in history, arguing that Apple paying the full 12.5% Irish corporate tax rate would harm the U.S. exchequer;</li><li>Germany has condemned Ireland for its tax tools, however, Germany blocked the EU Commission's push for <i>country-by-country reporting</i> ("CbCr") which would effectively end <i>EU tax havens</i>, and the German administration neutralised its own Parliament's 2018 "Royalty Barrier" by exempting all OECD–approved IP–schemes (i.e. all of Ireland's BEPS tools), see German Lizenzschranke;</li><li>Tax haven economist, Gabriel Zucman, showed in 2018 that most corporate tax disputes are between high-tax jurisdictions, and not between high-tax and low-tax corporate tax haven jurisdictions.  In fact, Zucman's (et alia) analysis shows that disputes with the major corporate tax havens of Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, are rare.</li></ol></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Source_of_contradictions">Source of contradictions</span></h3>
<p>Tax haven experts explain these contradictions as resulting from the different agendas of the major OECD taxing authorities, and particularly the U.S., and Germany, who while not themselves considered tax havens or corporate tax havens, rank #2 and #7 respectively in the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index of tax <b>secrecy jurisdictions</b>:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">71</span></p>
<div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li>U.S. Perspective I.  Pre the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA"), the U.S. had one of the highest global rates of corporation tax at 35%.  Allowing U.S. multinationals to "check-the-box"  The <i>aggregate worldwide</i> tax rates of U.S. multinationals is far lower than 35%.  This compromise was not unanimously supported in Washington and some U.S. multinationals still inverted to Ireland.  Tax academics have labelled Washington's concession to U.S. multinationals as the <i>exorbitant tax privilege</i> (and link it to the wider economic concept of U.S. exorbitant privilege).</li><li>U.S. Perspective II.  If the U.S. forced U.S. multinationals <i>not to use</i> tax havens, then U.S. multinationals would be forced to pay higher taxes in the global jurisdictions in which they operate.  As first shown in the 1994 Hines–Rice paper, the U.S. has long been aware that by allowing U.S. multinationals to use BEPS tools from global corporate tax havens, increases the ultimate taxes received by the U.S. exchequer.  The 2017 TCJA U.S. repatriation tax of 15.5% would not have been payable had U.S. multinationals been paying full foreign taxes on their non–U.S. income.</li><li>EU Perspective I.  The EU is the world's largest net exporting block.  Many EU countries therefore also rely on IP–based BEPS tools to re-charge gross profits from global sales of automobiles, chemicals, and other exports, back to the EU.  Because most EU countries run a "territorial" tax system, which allows lower tax rates for foreign sourced income, EU multinationals do not need to use Irish BEPS tools as the U.S. multinationals do;  Tax haven expert, James R. Hines Jr., saw this when researching why German multinationals make so little use of tax havens in 2016.</li><li>EU Perspective II.  A second noted EU perspective is that if U.S. multinationals need Ireland as a BEPS hub because the pre–TCJA U.S. "worldwide" tax system did not enable them to charge IP direct from the U.S. (without incurring larger U.S. taxes), then the money Ireland extracts from these U.S. multinationals (e.g. some Irish corporate taxes and Irish salaries), are still a net positive for the aggregate EU–28 economy.  Ireland and other so-called "EU tax havens", can extract EU "rents" from U.S. multinationals, which EU multinationals don't have to pay.</li></ol></div>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: Double Irish arrangement § Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</div>
<p>Before the passing of the TCJA in December 2017, the U.S. was one of eight remaining jurisdictions to run a "worldwide" taxation system, which was the principal obstacle to U.S. corporate tax reform, as it was not possible to differentiate between the source of income.  The seven other "worldwide" tax systems, are: Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Mexico, and Poland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">72</span></p><p>Tax experts expect the anti-BEPS provisions of the TCJA's new hybrid "territorial" taxation system, the GILTI and BEAT tax regimes, to neutralize some Irish BEPS tools (e.g. the double Irish and the single malt).  In addition, the TCJA's FDII tax regime makes U.S.–controlled  multinationals indifferent as to whether they charge-out their IP from the U.S. or from Ireland, as net effective tax rates on IP, under the FDII and GILTI regimes, are very similar.  Post-TCJA, S&amp;P500 IP–heavy U.S.–controlled multinationals, have guided 2019 tax rates that are similar, whether legally headquartered in Ireland or the U.S.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">73</span></p><p>Tax academic, Mihir A. Desai, in a post-TCJA 26 December 2017 interview in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> said that: "So, if you think about a lot of technology companies that are housed in Ireland and have massive operations there, they’re not going to maybe need those in the same way, and those can be relocated back to the U.S.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">74</span></p><p>It is expected Washington will be less accommodating to U.S. multinationals using Irish BEPS tools and locating IP in tax havens. The EU Commission has also become less tolerant of U.S. multinational use of Irish BEPS tools, as evidenced by the €13 billion fine on Apple for Irish tax avoidance from 2004–2014.  There is widespread unhappiness of Irish BEPS tools in Europe, even from other tax havens.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: Corporate haven § U.S. as BEPS winner</div>
<p>While the Washington and EU political compromises tolerating Ireland as a corporate tax haven may be eroding, tax experts point to various technical flaws in the TCJA which, if not resolved, may actually enhance Ireland as a U.S. corporate tax haven:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">77</span></p>
<div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li>Acceptance of Irish capital allowance charges in the GILTI calculation.  Ireland's most powerful BEPS tool is the capital allowances for intangible assets scheme (i.e Apple's Green Jersey). With TCJA participation relief, U.S. multinationals can now achieve net effective <i>U.S. tax rates</i> of 0% to 3% via this Irish BEPS tool.  In June 2018, Microsoft prepared a Green Jersey scheme.</li><li>Tax relief of 10% of Tangible Assets in the GILTI calculation.  This incentivizes the development of Irish infrastructure as the Irish tax code doubles this U.S. GILTI relief with Irish tangible capital allowances.  Every $100 a U.S. multinational spends on Irish offices reduces their <i>U.S.</i> taxes by $42 ($21 &amp; $21).  Google has doubled their Irish hub in 2018.</li><li>Assessment of GILTI on an <i>aggregate</i> basis rather than a <i>country-by-country</i> basis. Ireland's BEPS schemes generate large tax reliefs that net down the <i>aggregate</i> global income eligible for GILTI assessment, thus reducing TCJA's anti-BEPS protections, and making Ireland's BEPS tools a key part of U.S. multinational post-TCJA tax planning.</li></ol></div>
<p>A June 2018 IMF country report on Ireland, while noting the significant exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. corporates, concluded that the TCJA may not be as effective as Washington expects in addressing Ireland as a U.S. corporate tax haven.  In writing its report, the IMF conducted confidential anonymous interviews with Irish corporate tax experts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">78</span></p><p>Some tax experts, noting Google and Microsoft's actions in 2018, assert these flaws in the TCJA are deliberate, and part of the U.S. Administration's original strategy to reduce <i>aggregate</i> effective global tax rates for U.S. multinationals to circa 10–15% (i.e. 21% on U.S. income, and 3% on non–U.S. income, via Irish BEPS tools).  There has been an increase in U.S. multinational use of Irish intangible capital allowances, and some tax experts believe that the next few years will see a boom in U.S. multinationals using the Irish "Green Jersey" BEPS tool and on-shoring their IP to Ireland (rather than the U.S.).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">79</span></p><p>As discussed in § Hines–Rice 1994 definition and § Source of contradictions, the U.S. Treasury's corporation tax policy seeks to maximise long-term U.S. taxes paid by using corporate tax havens to minimise near-term foreign taxes paid.  In this regard, it is possible that Ireland still has a long-term future as a U.S. corporate tax haven.
