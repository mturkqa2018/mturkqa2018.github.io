<p>The story of the Exodus is told in the books of Exodus</a>, Leviticus</a>, Numbers</a>, and Deuteronomy</a>, the last four of the five books of the Torah</a> (also called the Pentateuch). It begins with the Israelites</a> in slavery. Their prophet Moses</a> leads them out of Egypt and through the wilderness to Mount Sinai</a>, where Yahweh</a> reveals himself to his people and establishes the Mosaic covenant</a>: they are to keep his <i>torah</i> (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. The Israelites accept the covenant and receive their laws, and, with Yahweh now present in their midst, journey on from Sinai, towards the promised land, but when told that the land is filled with giants</a> they refuse to go on, and Yahweh condemns them to remain in the desert until the generation that left Egypt passes away. After thirty-eight years at the oasis of Kadesh Barnea</a> the next generation travel on to the borders of Canaan, where Moses addresses them for the final time, reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. The Exodus ends with the death of Moses on Mount Nebo</a> and his burial by Yahweh</a>, while the Israelites prepare for the conquest of the land.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERedmount200159-60_13-0" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Covenant_and_law">Covenant and law</span></h3>
<p>The climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBandstra200828-29_4-1" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3–8 the Israelites agree to abide by the "book of the covenant" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the "words of the covenant" – the Ten Commandments</a> – on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel "beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb" (Deuteronomy 29:1).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcKenzie20004-5_14-0" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> The laws are set out in a number of codes:<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBandstra2008146_15-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Scholars are broadly agreed that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE), echoing a traditional Jewish view which gives Ezra</a>, the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon, a pivotal role in its promulgation.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERomer20082_and_fn.3_16-0" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> The tradition behind it stretches back some two hundred years before then, to a point in the late 7th century BCE when various oral and written elements were drawn together into works which were the fore-runners of the Torah we know today.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcEntire20088_17-0" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> The first trace appears in the northern prophets Amos</a> (possibly) and Hosea</a> (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in the northern Israel</a>, but their southern contemporaries Isaiah</a> and Micah</a> show no knowledge of an exodus.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELemche1985327_6-1" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
The story may, therefore, have originated a few centuries earlier, perhaps the 9th or 10th BCE, and there are signs that it took different forms in Israel, in the Transjordan region</a>, and in the southern Kingdom of Judah</a> before being unified in the Persian era.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERussell20091_18-0" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Many theories have been advanced to explain the composition of the Torah, but two have been especially influential.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESka2006217_19-0" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The first of these, Persian Imperial authorisation, advanced by Peter Frei in 1985, holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESka2006218_20-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Frei's theory was demolished at an interdisciplinary symposium held in 2000, but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a crucial question.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEskenazi200986_21-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> The second theory, associated with Joel P. Weinberg and called the "Citizen-Temple Community", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESka2006226–227_22-0" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> The Torah (the Exodus story) served as an "identity card" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESka2006225_23-0" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The Exodus has also resonated through non-Jewish culture. Some influences have been trivial but curiously significant – medieval Irish and Scottish legendary history, for example, derived the name of Scotland from Scota, supposedly a daughter of the pharaoh of the Exodus who later emigrated to the British isles.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAssmann2018335_27-0" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Others have been more significant: the hostility of the exodus tradition to the State (specifically to Egypt and the pharaoh) played a role in the Puritan Revolution</a> in 17th-century England,
