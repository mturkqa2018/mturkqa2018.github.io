<p>The <b>Chiapas conflict</b> (Spanish: <i>Conflicto de Chiapas</i>) refers to the <b>1994 Zapatista Uprising</b> and its aftermath, and tensions between the indigenous peoples and subsistence farmers in the Mexican state of Chiapas from the 1990s to the present day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The Zapatista uprising started in January 1994, and lasted less than two weeks before a ceasefire was agreed upon. Negotiations between the government and Zapatistas led to agreements being signed. But these agreements were not complied with in the following years and the peace process stagnated. This resulted in an increasing division between communities with ties to the government and communities that sympathized with the Zapatistas. Social tensions, armed conflict and para-military incidents increased, culminating in the killing of 45 people in the village of Acteal in 1997 by an anti-zapatista militia. Though at a low level, rebel activity continues and violence occasionally erupts between Zapatista supporters and anti-Zapatista militias along with the government. The last related incident occurred in 2014, when a Zapatista-affiliated teacher was killed and 15 more wounded in Chiapas.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-Colonial_Mexico">Post-Colonial Mexico</span></h3>
<p>After the Mexican War of Independence, Mexico kept many features of its Spanish colonizers, including limpieza de sangre or "cleanliness of blood," a legal code that distinguished those of non-Christian ancestries from those of Christian ones. This was the starting point for many land rights and social rights struggles that have taken place since. Some of this can be attributed to the strict structure of Mexican social classes with the Criollo people at the top, who were Mexicans of direct Spanish descent.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Revolutionary_Mexico">Revolutionary Mexico</span></h3>
<p>The same issue appeared amongst the non-Criollo population in later years, especially among the Mestizo population during the 19th century. In the Mexican Revolution of 1910, poor farmers and other marginalized groups, led by Emiliano Zapata, rebelled against the government and large land tenants due to failures of the authoritarian regime of Porfirio Díaz.  It is from Zapata that the Zapatistas got their name.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Hewing to a Marxist dialectic of class warfare which believed that the rural land system based upon old Spanish law rather than diffuse socioeconomic issues had perpetuated a corrupt system, revolutionary leaders in conjunction with collaborating ruling class families instituted wealth redistribution whilst maintaining the essence of private property.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Democratic_Mexico">Democratic Mexico</span></h3>
<p>Consequently, the years after the revolution (1917–1934) saw agrarian reforms, and in article 27 of the Mexican Constitution the encomienda system was abolished and the right to communal land for traditional communities was affirmed. Thus the ejido system was created, which organized lands that were able to be worked by various members of rural and indigenous communities, but were often sold off to multinational corporations. The compromise recognized the right of individuals to own private property and of associations, whether Indian or other, to similarly own property, thereby allowing for security, safety, and property of the mostly Spanish upper class whilst elevating Indian and Meztizo groups to equality before the law while simultaneously allowing them to retain their traditional pre-colonial and colonial customs and rights.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>However, since the issues of material and political equality were more complex than simple Marxist land class problems, rather than instantly bringing about an increase in material wealth and standard of living, the living conditions of most of the country remained as before.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>This was especially true in the Yucatán peninsula where stubborn resistance of the Mayan population along with complex historical development features, kept the geographical area divided between an almost wholly European property owning and wage earning population living along the coasts and certain inland areas and the interior which in essence remained a Mayan country of collective ownership.  Consequently, removed from the overall Mexican economic system, the native Mayan Indian nation remained as a free but marginalized underclass much the same as before the revolution.

<p>The hardened division of class and race remained in the Yucatán until the 1950s when the Mexican government began to use economic policy to better integrate indigenous Mayans into Mexican society. Perceiving the lack of sufficient jobs in the city and desirous of not upsetting the Mexican communities in the cities, the government encouraged and steered many landless farmers, mainly Mayan Indians, into settling in the uncultivated Lacandon Jungle and the abandoned white farms which had suffered an enduring economic depression of the previous twenty years. However, although this kept a social crisis from occurring in the cities, it enraged many displaced Mexican farmers, especially of Criollo class, whose rights to land and title were supposedly being ignored in contravention of the compromise of the Mexican revolution.  Thus, during the 1950s and 1960s, this immigration of Mayans into former white lands led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rain forest which in turn led to environmental degradation and further economic ruin of the rural economy.  Furthermore, rather than bring individual Mayan families into the practice of private property and the larger Mexican economy, the process backfired as much of the surplus Mayan community moved from its traditional areas into the new lands.

<p>As the crisis threatened to grow into rebellion by the mostly European population, and realizing that the ecological ruin caused by the movement wasn't being mitigated by economic prosperity within the Mayan population, the government decided to halt the migration.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>To halt the migration, the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest (614,000 hectares, or 6140 km2), encompassing both the previously unsettled regions and the former Mexican-owned farms, as a protected area: the "Montes Azules Bio-sphere Reserve". They appointed only one small population group (66 Lacandon Indian families) as tenants (thus creating the Lacandon Community), thereby displacing 2000 Tzeltal and Chol families from 26 communities, and leaving non-Lacandon communities dependent on the government for asserting their rights to land.

<h3><span id="1980s.E2.80.9390s_Mexico"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="1980s–90s_Mexico">1980s–90s Mexico</span></h3>
<p>Since the 1980s and 1990s, Mexico's economic policy concentrated more on industrial development and attracting foreign capital. The Salinas government initiated a process of privatization of land (through the PROCEDE-program). The EZLN claims that it has existed since 1983, although it only began to gain traction by the early 1990s.

<p>In 1992, as a (pre)condition for Mexico for entering the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Canada, art.4 and art.27 of the Constitution were modified, by means of which it became possible to privatize communal ejido-land. This undermined the basic security of indigenous communities to land entitlement, and former <i>ejidatorios</i> now became formally <i>illegal land-squatters</i>, and their communities informal settlements.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In the Lacandon jungle in Chiapas, a rebellion began to take shape against the marginalization of the indigenous population, the 1992 amendment to the Constitution, and the expected results of NAFTA.

<p>In 1982, General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, then Governor of Chiapas, increased acts of violent oppression against indigenous people. Members of the National Liberation Forces (FLN), one of which became Subcomondante Marcos, moved into the area later that year, and by late 1983 the EZLN was formed by 3 indigenous people and 3 mestizos.

<p>In December of 1993, The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) issued the First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, which declared that the government of Mexico and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari were illegitimate. This declaration was heavily rooted in Emeliano Zapata's Plan of Ayala (1911), which denounced the dictatorial regime of President Francisco Madero and proposed several measures to reform the government.

<p>On 1 January 1994, the EZLN began their military insurrection in the southernmost province of Mexico, Chiapas, in the name of the rights of oppressed indigenous peoples and democracy; this was the same date on which the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect. The EZLN based their operations out of the Lacandon Jungle, and used this as their launching point for capturing the towns of Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Altamirano, and San Cristóbal de las Casas. On 12 January, the federal government reached a ceasefire agreement with the EZLN.

<p>These developments attracted a lot of international attention and criticism. While human rights organisations emphasized the marginalization of the indigenous population, Riordan Roett (adviser to the Emerging Markets Group of the Chase Manhattan Bank) stated in January 1995:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
"While Chiapas, in our opinion, does not pose a fundamental threat to Mexican political stability, it is perceived to be so by many in the investment community. The government will need to eliminate the Zapatistas to demonstrate their effective control of the national territory and of security policy."<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Just 2 days later the Mexican army came into action to bring the Zapatista occupied areas back under their control, but they did not succeed in arresting subcomandante Marcos or other leaders of the EZLN.

<p>In February of 1995, the new President, Ernesto Zedillo, attacked the EZLN once again, which proved to be politically unpopular, which resulted in new peace negotiations that culminated in the San Andrés Accords of 1996.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In 1996 the Comisión de Concordia y Pacificación (COCOPA) presented a proposal of constitutional reform (the Cocopa law) based on the San Andrés Accords to the EZLN and the federal government. As a gesture of political will to solve the conflict peacefully the Zedillo-government signed this proposal, thereby recognizing the indigenous culture and its right to land and autonomy (in concordance with International Labour Organization convention 169, signed by Mexico in 1990).

<p>These agreements however were not complied with in the following years and the peace process stagnated. This resulted in an increasing division between people and communities with ties to the government and communities that sympathized with the Zapatistas. Social tensions, armed conflict and para-military incidents increased, culminating in the killing of 45 people in the village of Acteal in 1997 by para-militaries.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Internationally this atrocity led to great upheaval. The European Commission, at that time negotiating an Association Agreement and Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, adopted in January 1998 a resolution in which the involvement of the Mexican army and local government in the para-military violence was condemned, and President Zedillo was encouraged to re-initiate the peace process. The European Parliament even proposed to postpone the ratification of the agreement.

<p>The peace process has been in a gridlock ever since, the government officially ignores the EZLN, seeing it just as a political rival, but armed attacks involving pro-government para-military groups frequently make civilian casualties. (see the list below).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_development_policies">Social development policies</span></h2>
<p>Although and because the Chiapas conflict is intricately linked with low intensity conflict and fourth generation warfare, it is important to stress that the conflict is not only about military or para-military action against armed rebels. Addressing the problems in the region with social development programs are often interpreted by the target group as "counter-insurgency light"; as a means to divide and rule.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Since the creation of the Lacandon Community (1971) and the growing tensions in the region, and even more so since the Zapatista uprising (1994), the government has been faced by three challenges:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p>
<ol><li>preservation of the rainforest in the Lacandon region</li>
<li>combatting poverty &amp; stimulating citizenship among the communities in the Lacandon region</li>
<li>control over the socio-political situation in the Lacandon region</li></ol>
<p>These goals have been included in several social development programs. Examples are <i>Programa Solidaridad</i>, <i>Plan Cañadas</i>, <i>PIDSS</i>, and Prodesis.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p>
<h3><span id="Plan_Ca.C3.B1adas"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Plan_Cañadas">Plan Cañadas</span></h3>
<p><i>Plan Cañadas</i> (1994–2001) (cañada = glen or valley) was conceived after they found guerrilla training camps in the Lacandon Jungle in 1993 (just before the Zapatista uprising). This programme was aimed at suppressing the expected uprising by social means, by giving support to people who were more favourably disposed to the government, and thus ensuring their loyalty to the state. Over time <i>Plan Cañadas</i> was criticised for being a counter-insurgency project ("counter-insurgency-by-other-means", or "counter-insurgency light") designed in the framework of the low intensity conflict:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was in the aftermath of the rebellion that the Mexican government began to devote resources to the region for development, establishing the Cañadas Programme. However, a few years after the initiative was introduced it became highly criticised because of its counter-insurgent character (it offered resources in exchange for the abandonment of the Zapatista cause) and because of its failure in promoting development."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="PIDSS">PIDSS</span></h3>
<p><i>Plan Cañada'</i>s successor was the <i>Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Jungle</i>: <i>PIDSS</i>  (Programa Integral para el Desarrollo Sustentable de la Selva). This project, that started in 2001, was introduced as "a joint effort to foster development in a participatory way". Goals were to change the relationship between government and society, foster social reconciliation, exclude paternalism, promote participation, and endorse real development projects. The implementation of the programme was achieved through the creation of 34 micro-regions (similar to those under which the <i>Cañadas Programme</i> worked). However, <i>PIDSS</i> received much of the same criticism as <i>Plan Cañadas</i>:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p>

The <b>types of projects that appear in the development plans are the same as those promoted during the Cañadas Programme</b>. [...] Villagers in the region display much disillusionment and discontent. In fact, in most of the interviews it was affirmed that the present programme was worse than its predecessor. [...] The situation suggests that the authorities did not take properly into account the difficulties that the new initiative would encounter and which are the source of its problems. [...] A very important source of conflict has come from the <b>groups that benefited most from the Cañadas Programme. These groups have fought very hard to keep their privileges and to return to the previous model,</b> [...] <b>which has distorted the operation of the programme and led to further conflict</b>. [...] Moreover, the <b>presence of Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in the region, which do not desire any relationship with the Mexican government and thus do not participate in the PIDSS, complicates things even further</b>. Disputes over land are very common, and the presence of paramilitary forces confronting the Zapatistas makes the situation even more difficult.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>There is a lack of coordination between different government institutions, and even some divergence of objectives. The state government, for instance, seems to perceive <b>hidden interests among the officials of the federal government for the PIDSS to fail</b>. [...] The technicians of the federal government seem to be much better prepared than the others, which allows them to dominate and impose their decisions. [...] The technicians seem to have a disproportionate amount of discretionary power. This is dangerous if we take into account that the main problems of the Cañadas Programme came through the behaviour of some of the federal government technicians. And in fact our research has shown that in some communities <b>complaints about the counter-insurgency behaviour of the technicians have began to appear</b>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Another source of problems for the PIDSS seems to lie in the <b>notions of participation and development</b> pursued and those of the different actors. From the very beginning there was a general agreement that the Programme had to be participative and foster development. However, no effort was made to reach an agreement on what these concepts mean and entail. The result is that, for instance, the <b>PIDSS has sought participation of the population in a very limited way</b>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>In the interviews with the social organisations it was also argued that their problems to participate were due to the fact that they defend <b>a notion of development that is opposed to that of the government</b>. They argue that the PIDSS is an element that has to be related with the wider <i>Puebla-Panama Plan</i>, which is a regional development plan based on the implantation of low-wage factories (maquiladoras) and similar liberal economic initiatives. In opposition to this, people in the <b>communities talk about the importance of land and about maintaining their way of life</b>. Again, these elements are not taken into account in the design and operation of the Programme, and as a consequence have a negative impact in its outcomes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p><b>Conclusions</b>:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p>
<ol><li>The permanent conflict in the area and past development initiatives are important determinants that should have been better taken into account and incorporated in the design of the program.</li>
<li>Issues regarding coordination among different levels of the administration have proved to be a source of problems. These appear at the level of objectives, but also in the day-to-day operation, with the important role of the technicians and their discretionary power as a key issue.</li>
<li>The underlying notions of development and participation certainly determine the nature of the initiative and people's expectations of it, and thus have to be dealt with from the beginning. Promoting participation but then to have it managed through questionnaires in which people have no input and which are filled in by secondary school students implies an understanding of the concept that is, at the very least, problematic.[1]</li></ol>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prodesis">Prodesis</span></h3>
<p>The follow-up of <i>PIDSS</i> was Prodesis (2004–2008), an EU-Chiapas cooperation project targeted at 16 of the 34 micro-regions identified by <i>PIDSS</i>.
The difficulties this new project encountered were exactly the same as the PIDSS-project stumbled upon:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>It was argued that "Prodesis sought participation of the population in a very limited way".</li>
<li>Also there were accounts of "counter-insurgency behaviour of the technicians".</li>
<li>Moreover, the fact that Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities do not desire any relationship with the Mexican government prevents full participation of the whole target group, leading to "further conflict between and within communities".</li>
<li>Finally, it was argued, Prodesis interpreted the problems in the region along demographic lines, "ignoring the cultural and socio-political history of the region" (i.e., the fact that a large part of the population defends a notion of development that is opposed to that of the government, and stresses the importance of land and maintaining their way of life).</li></ul></blockquote>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h3>
<p>All of these projects <i>(Cañadas, PIDSS, Prodesis)</i> have been criticized for being actually counter-insurgency projects, aimed at controlling and pacifying the population, rather than improving their living conditions and resolving the conflict by addressing the land issue. Because of scepticism among the target groups of these programs (for lack of consultation, transparency and democracy, by being top-down and counter-insurgent, and having no respect for the population or local organizations) many projects fail. Therefore, a future challenge for the government (federal or state) is to:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p>
<ul><li>preserve the rainforest, as well as to</li>
<li>improve the social conditions of the population, but</li>
<li>without being suspected of counter-insurgency and low intensity warfare.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Media_Influence">Media Influence</span></h2>
<p>While the Zapatistas have little physical effect outside of Chiapas, their domination of the "information space" has strengthened their image and allies from foreign activists and journalists. Because the members of EZLN are residents of Chiapas, living in the jungle, original material for the organization started out as written communiques for media outlets, which were then uploaded to the Internet. Many forums and websites dedicated to the discussion of the Chiapas conflict are sponsored by advocacy groups centered on Latin America and indigenous protection, mostly situated in North America and Western Europe.  Soon after the uprising, fax campaigns and public caravans were popular methods of gaining media attention and organizing supporters.
