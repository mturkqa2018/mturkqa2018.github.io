The airline provides international passenger and cargo services to multiple destinations and has air service agreements with 42 countries. The headquarters of the airline, <i>Balaka Bhaban</i>, is located in Kurmitola, in the northern part of Dhaka. Annual Hajj flights; transporting tourists, migrants and non-resident Bangladeshi workers; and the activities of its subsidiaries form an integral part of the corporate business of the airline. The carrier is currently facing stiff competition from a number of domestic Bangladeshi private airlines as well as some international carriers, which offer greater flexibility targeting Bangladesh's air transport sector, which is experiencing an 8% annual growth rate, thanks to a large number of tourists and non-resident Bangladeshi travellers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an internal monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996. In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations but it was adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City in the west to Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country's largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a public limited company in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet. The airline had made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more in 2008. After getting delivery of the new planes, Biman expanded its destinations and increased in-flight amenities, especially onboard Internet and WiFi; mobile telephony; and live TV streams. Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European Aviation Safety Agency. In addition, Biman has also successfully passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit and since then, the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe.

<p>Biman Bangladesh Airlines was established on 4 January 1972 as Bangladesh's national airline under the Bangladesh Biman Ordinance (Presidential Order No. 126). The initiative to launch the flag carrier was taken by 2,500 former employees, including ten Boeing 707 commanders and seven other pilots of Pakistan International Airlines, who submitted a proposal to the government on 31 December 1971 following the independence of Bangladesh. The airline was initially called <i>Air Bangladesh</i> but was soon changed to its current name.

<p>On 4 February 1972, Biman started its domestic services, initially linking Dhaka with Chittagong, Jessore and Sylhet, using a single Douglas DC-3 acquired from India. Following the crash of this DC-3 on 10 February 1972, near Dhaka, during a test flight, two Fokker F27s belonging to Indian Airlines and supplied by the Indian government entered the fleet as a replacement. Shortly afterwards, additional capacity was provided with the incorporation of a Douglas DC-6, loaned by the World Council of Churches, which was in turn replaced with another Douglas DC-6, a DC-6B model leased from Troll-Air, to operate the Dhaka-Calcutta route. On 4 March 1972, Biman started its international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian. The short haul fleet was supplemented by a Fokker F27 from India on 3 March 1972; the aircraft was employed on a daily scheduled flight between Calcutta and Dhaka on 28 April 1972. Three additional Fokker F27s were acquired during March and September of that year. In the first year of operation, Biman operated 1,079 flights carrying just over 380,000Â passengers.

<p>Four Fokker F27s joined the fleet in 1973, enabling Biman to double the frequency of the Kolkata flight to a twice daily service. A Boeing 707 was added to the fleet in September and the flight to London became twice-weekly, while a Chittagongâ€“Kolkata flight also began operating. In 1974, operations were extended to Kathmandu (February), Bangkok (November) and Dubai (December). In 1976, Biman sold two of its Fokker F27s and bought another Boeing 707 to extend international services to Abu Dhabi, Karachi and Mumbai. Singapore was added to Biman's list of international destinations, when a third Boeing 707 was purchased in February 1977, followed by Jeddah, Doha and Amsterdam the following year, which also saw the purchase of its fourth Boeing 707. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation to be governed by a board of directors appointed by the government. The airline broke even for the first time in 1977â€“78, and made a profit the following year. International destinations expanded to include Kuala Lumpur, Athens, Muscat and Tripoli in 1979, followed by Yangon, Tokyo and Dhahran in 1980. Biman took delivery of its first 85-seater Fokker F28-4000 in 1981. In 1983, three Douglas DC-10s joined the fleet and the airline started to phase out the Boeing 707s. The flight network expanded further to include Baghdad (1983), Paris (1984) and Bahrain (1986). On 5 August 1984, Biman faced its worst accident ever when a Fokker F27 flying in from Chittagong crashed near Dhaka, killing all 49 on board. The long haul fleet was then supplemented by the purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996, followed by the addition of two more in 2000, from Singapore Airlines and Air Jamaica, and another in 2003.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ownership">Ownership</span></h3>
<p>The airline was wholly owned by the Bangladeshi government through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation since its inception. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation which afforded Biman limited autonomy, led by a government-appointed board of directors. The authorised share capital was increased to BDTÂ 2Â billion in 1987, and Biman was transformed into a public limited company, the largest in Bangladesh, in 2007.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1980s">1980s</span></h4>
<p>During the late 1980s, Hossain Mohammad Ershad, President of Bangladesh at the time, served as president of Biman. After an early period of expansion and growth, Biman entered an era of nose-diving profits and slow growth, exacerbated by incompetent and corrupt management, who padded purchases, falsified repair bills, and kept unprofitable routes in operation for political reasons. Research conducted in 1996 found that Biman had 5,253Â non-flying personnel, 30Â percent more than Singapore Airlines, a carrier who operated a fleet almost ten times the size of Biman's. The report described Biman as "poorly managed, overstaffed, undercapitalized, and subject to excessive political interference in its day-to-day management."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1990s">1990s</span></h4>
<p>In the 1992â€“93 fiscal year, accounts under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism revealed that BDTÂ 22Â million in tax was not paid to the government. The audit carried out in 1999, also showed that Biman was owed BDTÂ 2.2Â million by travel agents from the proceeds of ticket sales, most likely with the collusion of Biman officials. Additionally, BDTÂ 2.4Â million was overpaid as incentive commissions to the sales agents in violation of Biman policies. In 2007, the caretaker government launched an anti-corruption drive. This was shortly followed by the forced retirement of 35 other employees and officials, some of whom were close aides of Shamim Iskander. In 2008 Iskander, younger brother of former premier Khaleda Zia, was sent to jail over charges of concealing information regarding his wealth and not for his connection with Biman.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Faced with growing losses from the late 1990s onwards, the government offered 40Â percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping a buyer would take over the management of the carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6Â million in consultancy fees with no positive results.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2000s">2000s</span></h4>
<p>In the 2005â€“06 fiscal year, Biman carried 1.15Â million passengers, a growth of 70% over the previous decade. With the rise of private domestic carriers in Bangladesh, however, Biman's market share for domestic passengers dropped by 35% over the previous ten years' average, with only 162,000Â passengers travelling with Biman in the domestic sector in the 2005â€“06 fiscal year. During the same period, Biman reported its biggest annual loss of over US$120Â million (BDTÂ 8.3Â billion as of 2010), with a US$100Â million (BDTÂ 6.9Â billion as of 2010) loss reported the following year. Biman also fell behind on millions of dollars in payments to its fuel supplier, the Bangladesh Petroleum CorporationÂ (BPC), with debts that rose to BDTÂ 15.64Â billion in late DecemberÂ 2006<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2006-12</span>)</span>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_limited_company">Public limited company</span></h4>
<p>In MayÂ 2007<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2007-05</span>)</span>, the caretaker government approved plans to turn Biman into a public limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As a part of the restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDTÂ 2.97Â billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162Â applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel would not be allowed to leave the organisation via VRS.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>On 23 July 2007, Biman Bangladesh Airlines became the largest public limited company in Bangladesh. Earlier suggestions that the airline should be renamed Bangladesh Airlines were rejected. The government is the sole shareholder of the 1.5Â billion shares, but intends to offer 49Â percent to the private sector while retaining majority ownership. The previous managing director, Dr. Abdul Momen, was appointed as the chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director of the new organisation. The six directors were appointed from the ministries of energy, commerce, finance, civil aviation, foreign affairs, and the cabinet division, with the cabinet secretary taking on the role as chairman of the board of directors. The six secretaries and a joint secretary to the civil aviation ministry were made the seven shareholders of the new PLC. In SeptemberÂ 2008<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2008-09</span>)</span>, the government appointed Air Commodore Zahed Kuddus (retd) to replace Dr. Momen as CEO. From 2002 to 2005 Kuddus had been chair of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB), before which he had held various posts in the Bangladesh Air Force.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Following the privatisation, an initiative was launched by ex-Biman employees, who left the organisation via the VRS, to set up a competing airline. Names proposed for the airline included Air Bangla International, Biman Employees Airlines and Balaka. They were joined by previous managing directors of Biman, along with the former president of the Bangladesh Airline Pilots' Association. However, nothing further was heard of regarding the proposed venture.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The airline made profits in FY 2007â€“08 (BDTÂ 60Â million) and FY 2008â€“09 (BDTÂ 150Â million); In FY 2009â€“10, however, the carrier incurred in a net loss of BDTÂ 800Â million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2010s">2010s</span></h4>
<p>In FY 2010â€“11 it made losses of BDTÂ 2Â billion, despite the government exempting it a debt of about BDTÂ 11.94Â billion and BDTÂ 5.73Â billion owed to the BPC and the CAAB, respectively. In FY 2011â€“12 it made a loss of BDTÂ 6.06Â billion (<span style="white-space: nowrap">US$75</span>Â million); in FY 2012â€“13 unaudited figures show a loss of BDTÂ 2Â billion. The airline plans to be fully profitable by FY 2014â€“15. As of  DecemberÂ 2013, Biman owed BDTÂ 15.60Â billion to different sources; of which BDTÂ 3676.2Â million to CAAB and BDTÂ 8.50Â billion to Padma Oil Company, its fuel supplier. Biman made a profit of BDT 2.72 billion in FY 2014â€“15.

<p>Since 1972, BGH provides ground-handling services for all airports in Bangladesh; the company reported a profit of BDTÂ 4.5Â billion for the FY 2011â€“12. The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC was set up in 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Services">Services</span></h2>
<p>Biman is notable for disruptions to its flight schedule and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for its failure to maintain flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, during the summer of 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhakaâ€“London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In an article published in <i>The Times</i> on 10 September 2008 Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In 2013, Biman signed agreements with SITA  and Mercator to provide infrastructure support and revenue accounting services to the airline.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In 2014, Biman launched advance seat reservation system on its website. The airline also offers online meal selection option, where the passenger can choose from diabetic meals, vegetarian meals, Asian vegetarian meal, child meal and Muslim meal, that will be served on board.

<p>Biman relaunched its inflight magazine re-branded as <i>Bihanga</i> in September 2013. The bi-monthly magazine, previously known as <i>Diganta</i>, and prior to that <i>Jatri</i>, is published by Subcontinental Media Group. The magazine is available in both Bengali and English, covering topics about Bangladesh and Biman's destinations. English and Bengali language newspapers are also available on board in the aircraft. Biman launched in-flight duty-free sales in March 2014, branded as Biman Boutique. The duty-free products include: perfumes, cosmetics, jewellery, watches, children's gifts, chocolates and tobacco. In 2014, Biman launched amenity kits for children on-board which include colouring books, stationery, dolls and jigsaw puzzle. Biman doesn't usually serve alcoholic beverages on its flights in economy class.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>The newer Boeing 777s are equipped with modern in-flight entertainment systems. Every seat is fitted with personal touch screen displays provided by Thales which are loaded with movies, songs and games. It also has high resolution moving maps and live flight information. All this is available in two languages â€“ English and Bengali. Starting with the newly delivered Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Biman Bangladesh Airlines launched onboard Internet, WiFi, mobile telephony, movie streaming and live TV streaming services from September 2018 in most of the new planes in its fleet. Twenty-five satellites were deployed for this purpose. New Panasonic eX3 seat-back monitors with touch screens from Panasonic Avionics offer passengers more than one hundred on-demand movies, music and video games. Onboard touch screen 3D route-maps, the latest addition to the aviation industry, show the various structures of the territories the aircraft flies over.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ticketing">Ticketing</span></h3>
<p>An agreement was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution to comply with IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing allowed Biman to reduce costs, while eliminating the stress of lost tickets for passengers. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>In 2013, Biman signed an agreement with German e-ticketing company Hahn Air, enabling Biman's tickets to be purchased from anywhere around the world.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biman_Cargo">Biman Cargo</span></h3>
<p>Biman also operates a cargo service using the cargo holds of its passenger aircraft to ship freight to international destinations. It has established Cargo Village at Shahjalal International Airport where the cargo is packaged and labelled before being loaded onto its aircraft.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>While the air cargo industry in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% in the fiscal year 2003â€“04, Biman's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines, Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000Â tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>As with its passenger service and management, corruption has also been rife at Biman Cargo. An investigation in 2004 uncovered irregularities in a number of Biman's Middle East operations which deprived the government of millions of dollars in revenue. Biman officials in Dubai were found to have been "extending special privileges" to the main freight handler in exchange for bribes. The smuggling of foreign currency and gold bars is reported to have taken place at the Biman Cargo Village by Biman and CAAB employees. A number of arrests were made but the perpetrators evaded punishment through lack of evidence and pressure from the CAAB union.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Destinations">Destinations</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: List of Biman Bangladesh Airlines destinations</div>
<p>In December 2016, Biman served 23 destinations, of which 15 were international. However, the carrier has air service agreements with 43 countries leaving room for expansion for which it lacks aircraft. The airline operates flights to several destinations in the Middle East, some destinations in South and South East Asia and London in Europe.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>The airline announced intentions to commence flights to Guangzhou and Kunming in China in summer 2014. Former Biman board director Kazi Oahedul Alam criticised the expansion as poorly planned and not commercially viable.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_York_and_Manchester">New York and Manchester</span></h3>
<p>From 1993 to 2006, Biman operated flights to John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses to maintain a landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community in the north of England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the <i>Aviatour</i>, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine <i>Weekly Holiday</i>. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>The FAA had already warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these aircraft were inadequately equipped to safely cross the Atlantic. On 13 May 2006, the FAA refused permission for Biman flight BG001 (Dhakaâ€“Brusselsâ€“JFK) to enter its airspace, citing safety concerns over the ailing DCâ€“10 aircraft used on the route. The flight was diverted to MontrÃ©al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada, where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey. Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft and gave it a clean bill of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers. The FAA eventually admitted it was mistaken and apologised for the error.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>The incident put an end to the route, which had been losing <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$80,000</span> per flight, owing to its use of obsolete DC-10s. Biman decided to axe the route along with a number of other regional and domestic routes to curb the huge losses being incurred by the airline each month. However, in October 2007, Biman was directed by the then caretaker government to resume flights to New York. Biman was given until 25 October 2008 (extended from an earlier deadline of 23 March 2008) to resume flights to the airport by the JFK airport authority, after which it would have lost the landing slot permanently.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hajj_flights">Hajj flights</span></h3>
<p>The annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj is undertaken by thousands of Bangladesh's predominantly Muslim population. Biman has been the sole Bangladeshi airline permitted by the government to provide flights for pilgrims to King Abdulaziz International Airport, Jeddah. Every year, the commencement of these flights is inaugurated by high-ranking government officials, including, at times, the Prime Minister.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>In 2002, the government opened the service to private tour operators for the first time. The initial private flights were plagued with delays, with both outgoing and return flights postponed for as long as nine days, which caused the Bangladesh government to return the Hajj flights' monopoly to Biman.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="683" data-file-width="1023" height="147" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Biman_Bangladesh_Boeing_747-200_KvW.jpg/220px-Biman_Bangladesh_Boeing_747-200_KvW.jpg" srcset width="220"/> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div><div style='border: 3px solid red'><center><h1 style='color:red'>5</h1></center></div>Boeing 747-200 leased by Biman from Kabo Air.</div></div></div>
<p>Biman's handling of Hajj flights has also been beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high. In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the businessâ€“class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with the backlog of passengers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>In June 2007, the caretaker government approved a three-year Hajj policy aiming to alleviate the problems encountered during the previous two years. Hajj flights would also begin leaving from Bangladesh's two other international airports, Shah Amanat International Airport and Osmani International Airport. Biman put out a tender for the wet lease of two aircraft for additional Hajj flights and reached an agreement with Phuket Air. However, the deal fell through in August 2007 after Phuket Air demanded advance payment of 30% instead of the previously agreed-to 10%. Ausban Aeronautical Services of Australia was selected next, following a re-tender, to fill the gap left by Phuket Air. In 2008, Biman wet-leased a 542-seater Boeing 747-200 from Kabo Air of Nigeria for six months to operate flights to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Another 512-seater Boeing 747-300 was leased from Orient Thai Airlines.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>As of  JuneÂ 2014, Biman still experienced difficulties in providing their scheduled services, as the carrier gave priority to the transportation of pilgrims to Jeddah during the Hajj season using aircraft that otherwise were flown on its regular flights. Despite this, the airline reported a profit of almost BDTÂ 1Â billion from the 2012 Hajj season, the highest results ever since these services were started in 1973.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fleet_History">Fleet History</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1972-2000">1972-2000</span></h4>
<p>A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 were the first aircraft in Biman's fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes. In a deal worth <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$40,000,000</span> (equivalent to $78,969,128 in 2017), three British Aerospace ATPs were ordered in late 1989. These ATPs entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>During the mid-1990s, Biman switched its airliner of choice for long haul routes to the Airbus series of aircraft. In 1995, two PW4000-powered Airbus A310-300s were ordered; the first of them joined the fleet on 15Â JuneÂ 1996<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">1996-06-15</span>)</span>. It nevertheless retained its elderly DCâ€“10 fleet. For over three decades, the DCâ€“10â€“30s were Biman's sole widebody aircraft and served the airline consistently well, with no noteworthy mechanical problems â€“ in marked contrast to the record of its domestic operations. These were operated with Fokker F28 and BAe ATPs which were routinely out of service because of technical trouble. In one incident, a government minister disembarked a flight and travelled by road when he learned that the aircraft he was on was a BAe ATP. In January 2003, Biman leased two Boeing 737-300s which were used on domestic and regional routes for eighteen months.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made up most of Biman's international fleet, before the delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up the remainder of the fleet for the domestic and regional sectors, before they were retired in 2012. Biman's fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DCâ€“10 to come off the production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310â€“300s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996. The two Fokker F28â€“4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91Â million. Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet. The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule, as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations. A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.
A deal was signed in JanuaryÂ 2012<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2012-01</span>)</span> a three-year contract with a German company for the maintenance of their powerplants, for the DCâ€“10s. The airline operates its own ancillary and maintenance facilities at Shahjalal International Airport, where it carries out all maintenance work and C-Checks on DCâ€“10â€“30s and A310â€“300s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2000s_2">2000s</span></h4>
<p>In 2000, Biman put out a request for proposal for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DCâ€“10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1Â billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In MarchÂ 2007<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2007-03</span>)</span>, Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years. The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

<p>After Biman became a public limited company, renewed attempts were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$165</span>Â million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>On 10 March 2008, the Biman management unveiled a plan to procure eight next-generation wide-bodied aircraft from Boeing Commercial Airplanes for a total cost of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$1.26</span>Â billion, including four 419-seater Boeing 777-300ER (average price of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$182.9</span>Â million per unit), and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners that will seat 294 (<span style="white-space: nowrap">US$133.31</span>Â million per unit), to be delivered in 2017. The deal for the acquisition of these eight aircraft was signed with Boeing in April 2008, and also included a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of two Boeing 737-800s to be delivered in 2015, with Biman making an initial instalment of <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$1.54</span>Â million. Of the remaining cost, US-based EXIM bank will finance 85%, while a syndication of local banks will finance the balance. In June the same year, Biman placed a firm order for two Boeing 737-800s, and took options for two more aircraft of the type. The total order for these ten aircraft was valued at around <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$2.5</span>Â billion.

<p>In 2010, Biman leased two Boeing 777-200ERs from EuroAtlantic Airways. These aircraft were used mainly on routes to European destinations to cover the interim period before the delivery of the first two new Boeing 777-300ERs in 2011. To secure the delivery of these two brand new 777-300ERs the airline used an initial <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$277</span>Â million loan granted from JPMorgan Chase. Wearing a new livery, the carrier took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER in late October 2011. It was the 300th 777-300ER delivered by Boeing. The 301st ever delivered Boeing 777-300ER also went to Biman; the airline took possession of it in late NovemberÂ 2011<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2011-11</span>)</span>. The third Boeing 777-300ER, named <i>Aakash Pradeep</i>, was handed over to the carrier in FebruaryÂ 2014<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2014-02</span>)</span>; the fourth one, named <i>Raanga Pravat</i>, joined the fleet in MarchÂ 2014<span style="display:none">Â (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2014-03</span>)</span>, following the government approving a <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$356</span>Â million loan, of which <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$290</span>Â million will be provided by the Ex-Im Bank and the rest by the Standard Chartered Bank.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>Biman retired its entire McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet on 20 February 2014, by operating a special Dhaka-Birmingham farewell flight with its last DC-10, with a stopover at Kuwait; the carrier also operated nine separate aviation enthusiasts' scenic flights at Birmingham, from 22â€“24 February, three flights a day. The aircraft was then offered for sale as scrap in Dhaka. The Airbus A310-300s were withdrawn from service in October 2016.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>The carrier leased two Boeing 777-200ER aircraft from EgyptAir in March 2014. The airline plans to expand its fleet to 16 aircraft, to allow route expansion. With newly leased Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, the carrier is resuming full swing domestic flights to Cox's Bazar, Jessore, Saidpur, Rajshahi and Barisal in April 2015. The two aircraft, dry leased from Smart Aviation Company for a period of five years, will also be operated on regional flights to Kolkata and Yangon. Initially it was supposed to resume in November 2013, which Biman failed to as it was unable to find a lessor of aircraft.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>In February 2017, it was announced that the airline would acquire three of their own Dash 8-Q400 which will be used to replace the current aircraft leased from Smart Aviation Company to continue operating domestic and regional flights.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p><p>Due to reliability issues with its Boeing 777-200ER aircraft leased from EgyptAir, Biman announced in December 2017 that the aircraft would be returned in March and May 2018, one year ahead of the expiration of the lease.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>The airline received its first Boeing 787-8 in August 2018.

<p>In modern Bengali, the word à¦¬à¦¿à¦®à¦¾à¦¨ <i>biman</i> refers to "aeroplane", originating from the Sanskrit word <i>vimÄna</i>, a name given to a flying machine mentioned in ancient Vedic literature. The logo, painted on the tail, is a stylised white stork (à¦¬à¦²à¦¾à¦•à¦¾ <i>bÃ´laka</i>) inside a red circle. The logo was designed by painter Quamrul Hassan. The initial livery was a dark blue line extending across the aircraft along the windows and covering the tail section. This was replaced in the 1980s by dark green and red lines, matching the colours of the Bangladesh flag, and has remained so for over two decades.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>In 2010, Biman went through a rebranding exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced to revert to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that was applied to the new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">63</span></p><p>The <i>bÃ´laka</i> has also given its name to the Biman headquarters, the <i>Balaka Bhaban</i> (à¦¬à¦²à¦¾à¦•à¦¾ à¦­à¦¬à¦¨ <i>bÃ´laka bhÃ´ban</i>, Stork Building), and a landmark sculpture in Dhaka depicting storks is in front of Biman's former headquarters, the <i>Biman Bhaban</i> in the Motijheel Commercial Area in Dhaka.

<td>The aircraft that was operating an international scheduled Dubaiâ€“Chittagongâ€“Dhaka passenger service as <b>Flight 48</b> when it ran off the runway immediately after touchdown at Shah Amanat International Airport amid inclement weather; following the collapse of the starboard main undercarriage, the right-hand side engine got separated from the wing and caught fire as the aircraft sank into the mud. Some passengers got injuries while the aircraft was evacuated, but all of the occupants managed to escape from it safely. An enquiry found no failures with the aircraft and put the blame for the accident on the incompetence of the pilot, who was fired.
