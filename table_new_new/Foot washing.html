<p><b>Maundy</b> (from the Vulgate of John 13:34 <i>mandatum</i> meaning "command"), or the <b>Washing of the Feet</b>, is a religious rite observed by various Christian denominations. The name is taken from the first few Latin words sung at the ceremony of the washing of the feet, "<i>Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos</i>" ("I give you a new commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you") (John 13:34), and from the Latin form of the commandment of Christ that we should imitate His loving humility in the washing of the feet (John 13:14–17). The term <i>mandatum</i> (maundy), therefore, was applied to the rite of foot-washing on this day of the Christian Holy Week called Maundy Thursday.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>John 13:1–17 recounts Jesus' performance of this act. In verses 13:14–17, He instructs His disciples:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Many denominations (including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, and Catholics) therefore observe the liturgical washing of the feet on Maundy Thursday of Holy Week. Moreover, for some denominations, foot-washing was an example, a pattern. Many groups throughout Church history and many modern denominations have practiced foot washing as a church ordinance including Adventists, Anabaptists, Baptists, and Pentecostals.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The origin of the word <i>Maundy</i> has at least two possibilities:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<ol><li>Through Middle English and Old French <i>mandé</i>, from Latin <i>mandatum</i>.</li>
<li>From the Latin <i>mendicare</i>, Old French <i>mendier</i>, and English <i>maund</i>, which means "to beg" (verb) or a "small basket" (noun) held out by maunders (beggars) as they maunded (begged).</li></ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>The root of this practice appears to be found in the hospitality customs of ancient civilizations, especially where sandals were the chief footwear. A host would provide water for guests to wash their feet, provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests or even serve the guests by washing their feet. This is mentioned in several places in the Old Testament of the Bible (e.g. Genesis 18:4; 19:2; 24:32; 43:24; I Samuel 25:41; et al.), as well as other religious and historical documents. A typical Eastern host might bow, greet, and kiss his guest, then offer water to allow the guest to wash his feet or have servants do it. Though the wearing of sandals might necessitate washing the feet, the water was also offered as a courtesy even when shoes were worn.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>I Samuel 25:41 is the first biblical passage where an honored person offers to wash feet as a sign of humility. In John 12, Mary of Bethany anointed Jesus' feet presumably in gratitude for raising her brother Lazarus from the dead, and in preparation for his death and burial. The Bible records washing of the saint's feet being practised by the primitive church in I Timothy 5:10 perhaps in reference to piety, submission and/or humility. There are several names for this practice: <i>maundy</i>, <i>foot washing</i>, <i>washing the saints' feet</i>, <i>pedilavium</i>, and <i>mandatum</i>.

<p>Christian denominations that observe foot washing do so on the basis of the authoritative example and command of Jesus as found in John 13:1–15 (NKJV):
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus demonstrates the custom of the time when he comments on the lack of hospitality in one Pharisees home by not providing water to wash his feet in Luke 7:44:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The rite of foot washing finds its roots in scripture. Even after the death of the apostles or the end of the Apostolic Age, the practice was continued.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>It appears to have been practiced in the early centuries of post-apostolic Christianity, though the evidence is scant. For example, Tertullian (145–220) mentions the practice in his <i>De Corona</i>, but gives no details as to who practiced it or how it was practiced. It was practiced by the Church at Milan (c. 380), is mentioned by the <i>Council of Elvira</i> (300), and is even referenced by Augustine (c. 400).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Observance of foot washing at the time of baptism was maintained in Africa, Gaul, Germany, Milan, northern Italy, and Ireland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>According to the <i>Mennonite Encyclopedia</i> "St. Benedict's <i>Rule</i> (529) for the Benedictine Order prescribed hospitality feetwashing in addition to a communal feetwashing for humility"; a statement confirmed by the Catholic Encyclopedia. It apparently was established in the Roman church, though not in connection with baptism, by the 8th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The Albigenses observed footwashing in connection with communion, and the Waldenses' custom was to wash the feet of visiting ministers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>There is some evidence that it was observed by the early Hussites; and the practice was a meaningful part of the 16th century radical reformation. Foot washing was often "rediscovered" or "restored" by Protestants in revivals of religion in which the participants tried to recreate the faith and practice of the apostolic era which they had abandoned or lost.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Catholic_practice">Catholic practice</span></h2>
<p>In Catholic Church, the ritual washing of feet is now associated with the Mass of the Lord's Supper, which celebrates in a special way the Last Supper of Jesus, before which he washed the feet of his twelve apostles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Evidence for the practice on this day goes back at least to the latter half of the 12th century, when "the pope washed the feet of twelve sub-deacons after his Mass and of thirteen poor men after his dinner."  From 1570 to 1955, the Roman Missal printed, after the text of the Holy Thursday Mass, a rite of washing of feet unconnected with the Mass. For many years Pius IX performed the foot washing in the sala over the portico of Saint Peter's, Rome.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In 1955 Pope Pius XII revised the ritual and inserted it into the Mass. Since then, the rite is celebrated after the homily that follows the reading of the gospel account of how Jesus washed the feet of his twelve apostles (John 13:1–15). Some persons who have been selected – usually twelve, but the Roman Missal does not specify the number – are led to chairs prepared in a suitable place. The priest goes to each and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one's feet and dries them. There are some advocates of restricting this ritual to clergy or at least men.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In a notable break from the 1955 norms, Pope Francis washed the feet of two women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center in Rome 2013. In 2016 it was announced that the Roman Missal had been revised to permit women to have their feet washed on Maundy Thursday; previously it permitted only males to do so. In 2016 Catholic priests around the world washed both women’s and men’s feet on Holy Thursday "their gesture of humility represented to many the progress of inclusion in the Catholic church."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>At one time, most of the European monarchs also performed the Washing of Feet in their royal courts on Maundy Thursday, a practice continued by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and the King of Spain up to the beginning of the 20th century (see Royal Maundy). In 1181 Roger de Moulins, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller issued a statute declaring, "In Lent every Saturday, they are accustomed to celebrate maundy for thirteen poor persons, and to wash their feet, and to give to each a shirt and new breeches and new shoes, and to three chaplains, or to three clerics out of the thirteen, three deniers and to each of the others, two deniers".

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eastern_Orthodox_and_Byzantine_Catholic">Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic</span></h3>
<p>The Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches practice the ritual of the Washing of Feet on Holy and Great Thursday (Maundy Thursday) according to their ancient rites. The service may be performed either by a bishop, washing the feet of twelve priests; or by an Hegumen (Abbot) washing the feet of twelve members of the brotherhood of his monastery.  The ceremony takes place at the end of the Divine Liturgy.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>After Holy Communion, and before the dismissal, the brethren all go in procession to the place where the Washing of Feet is to take place (it may be in the center of the nave, in the narthex, or a location outside). After a psalm and some troparia (hymns) an ektenia (litany) is recited, and the bishop or abbot reads a prayer. Then the deacon reads the account in the Gospel of John, while the clergy perform the roles of Christ and his apostles as each action is chanted by the deacon. The deacon stops when the dialogue between Jesus and Peter begins. The senior-ranking clergyman among those whose feet are being washed speaks the words of Peter, and the bishop or abbot speaks the words of Jesus. Then the bishop or abbot himself concludes the reading of the Gospel, after which he says another prayer and sprinkles all of those present with the water that was used for the foot washing. The procession then returns to the church and the final dismissal is given as normal.

He blesses the water for the foot washing with the cross, just as he would for blessing holy water and he washes the feet of the entire congregation.

There will be some 12 selected men, both priests and the lay people, and the bishop or priest will wash and kiss the feet of those 12 men. It is not merely a dramatization of the past event. Further it is a prayer where the whole congregation prays to wash and cleanse them of their sins.

<p>Foot washing is observed by numerous Protestant and proto-Protestant groups, including Seventh-day Adventist, Pentecostal, and Pietistic groups, some Anabaptists, and several types of Southern Baptists.
Foot washing rites are also practiced by many Anglican, Lutheran and Methodist churches, whereby foot washing is most often experienced in connection with Maundy Thursday services and, sometimes, at ordination services where the Bishop may wash the feet of those who are to be ordained. Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the Lord's supper service.  The Moravian Church practiced Foot Washing until 1818.  There has been some revival of the practice as other liturgical churches have also rediscovered the practice.

<p>The observance of <i>washing the saints' feet</i> is quite varied, but a typical service follows the partaking of unleavened bread and wine. Deacons (in many cases) place pans of water in front of pews that have been arranged for the service. The men and women participate in separate groups, men washing men's feet and women washing women's feet. Each member of the congregation takes a turn washing the feet of another member. Each foot is placed one at a time into the basin of water, is washed by cupping the hand and pouring water over the foot, and is dried with a long towel girded around the waist of the member performing the washing. Most of these services appear to be quite moving to the participants.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Among groups that do not observe foot washing as an ordinance or rite, the example of Jesus is usually held to be symbolic and didactic. Among these groups, foot washing is nevertheless sometimes literally practiced. First, some reserve it to be a practice of hospitality or a work of necessity. Secondly, some present it as a dramatic lesson acted out in front of the congregation.

<p>Groups descending from the 1708 Schwarzenau Brethren, such as the Grace Brethren, Church of the Brethren, Brethren Church, Old German Baptist Brethren, and the Dunkard Brethren regularly practice foot washing (generally called "feetwashing") as one of three ordinances that compose their Lovefeast, the others being the Eucharist and a fellowship meal.  Historically related groups such as the Amish and most Mennonites also wash feet, tracing the practice to the 1632 Dordrecht Confession of Faith. For members, this practice promotes humility towards and care for others, resulting in a higher egalitarianism among members.

<p>Many Baptists observe the literal washing of feet as a third ordinance.  The communion and foot washing service is practiced regularly by members of the Separate Baptists in Christ, General Association of Baptists, Free Will Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Union Baptists, Old Regular Baptist, Christian Baptist Church of God, and Brethren in Christ. Feet washing is also practiced as a third ordinance by many Southern Baptists, General Baptists, and Independent Baptists.

<p>In the mid-1830s, Joseph Smith introduced the original temple rites of the Latter Day Saint movement in Kirtland, Ohio, which primarily involved foot washing, followed by speaking in tongues and visions. This foot washing took place exclusively among men, and was based upon the Old and New Testament. After Joseph Smith was initiated into the first three degrees of Freemasonry, this was adapted into the whole body "Endowment" ritual more similar to contemporary Mormon practice, which is nearly identical to Masonic temple rites, and does not specifically involve the feet.
In 1843, Smith included a foot washing element in the faith's second anointing ceremony in which elite married couples are anointed as heavenly monarchs and priests.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>The True Jesus Church includes footwashing as a scriptural sacrament based on John 13:1–11. Like the other two sacraments, namely Baptism and the Lord's Supper, members of the church believe that footwashing imparts salvific grace to the recipient—in this case, to have a part with Christ (John 13:8).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Most Church of God denominations also include footwashing in their Passover ceremony as instructed by Jesus in John 13:1–11.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Most Seventh-day Adventist congregations schedule an opportunity for foot washing preceding each quarterly (four times a year) Communion service. As with their "open" Communion, all believers in attendance, not just members or pastors, are invited to share in the washing of feet with another: men with men, women with women, and frequently, spouse with spouse. This service is alternatively called the Ordinance of Foot-Washing or the Ordinance of Humility. Its primary purpose is to renew the cleansing that only comes from Christ, but secondarily to seek and celebrate reconciliation with another member before Communion/the Lord's Supper.

One portion of the ritual, <i>Brit rechitzah</i>, involves the washing of the baby's feet.
