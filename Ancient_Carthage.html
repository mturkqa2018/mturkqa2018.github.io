<p>According to Roman sources, Phoenician colonists from modern-day Lebanon</a>, led by Dido</a> (also known as Queen Elissa), founded Carthage <i>circa</i> 814 BC.<sup id="cite_ref-Moscati2001654_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Queen Elissa (also known as "Alissar") was an exiled princess of the ancient Phoenician city of Tyre</a>. At its peak, the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the "shining city",<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> ruling 300 other cities around the western Mediterranean Sea</a> and leading the Phoenician world.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Elissa's brother, Pygmalion of Tyre</a>, had murdered Elissa's husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the "new city" of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin</a>, Princess Elissa was the daughter of King Belus II of Tyre. When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her brother, Pygmalion, and her. She married her uncle Acerbas</a>, also known as Sychaeus, the High Priest of Melqart</a>, a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between the religious elite and the monarchy</a>. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acerbas.<sup id="cite_ref-Aubet2001215_9-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Pygmalion assassinated Acerbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In the Roman epic of Virgil, the <i>Aeneid</a></i>, Queen Dido, the Greek name for Elissa, is first introduced as a highly esteemed character. In just seven years, since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to Aeneas</a> and his men, who have recently escaped from Troy</a>. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, Mercury</a>, sent by Jupiter</a>, reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a pyre</a> to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: "rise up from my bones, avenging spirit" (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of Hannibal</a>. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had founded, exemplified by Cato the Elder</a>'s much-repeated utterance, "<i>Carthago delenda est</a></i>", "Carthage must be destroyed".<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Although Strabo's claim that the Tyrians founded three hundred colonies along the west African coast is clearly exaggerated, colonies were established in Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Iberia</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Naylor2009_17-0" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of Libya.

<p>Carthage's economic successes, and its dependence on shipping to conduct most of its trade, led to the creation of a powerful Carthaginian navy.<sup id="cite_ref-FaganTrundle2010_38-0" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the Greeks</a> of Syracuse</a>, the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean.<sup id="cite_ref-Dodge2012_39-0" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out.

<p>By 410 BC, Carthage had recovered after serious defeats.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In 409 BC,<sup id="cite_ref-SorenKhader1991_51-0" class="reference">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> Hannibal Mago set out for Sicily with his force. He captured the smaller cities of Selinus (modern Selinunte</a>) and Himera</a> before returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war. But the primary enemy, Syracuse, remained untouched and, in 405 BC, Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition to claim the entire island. This time, however, he met with fierce resistance and ill-fortune.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In 398 BC, Dionysius had regained his strength and broke the peace treaty, striking at the Carthaginian stronghold of Motya</a>.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The fighting in Sicily swung in favor of Carthage in 387 BC. After winning a naval battle off the coast of Catania, Himilco laid siege to Syracuse with 50,000 Carthaginians, but yet another epidemic struck down thousands of them. Dionysius then launched a counterattack by land and sea, and the Syracusans surprised the enemy fleet while most of the crews were ashore, destroying all the Carthaginian ships. At the same time, Dionysius's ground forces stormed the besiegers' lines and routed the Carthaginians. Himilco and his chief officers abandoned their army and fled Sicily.<sup id="cite_ref-Eggenberger2012_55-0" class="reference">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> Himilco returned to Carthage in disgrace and was very badly received; he eventually committed suicide<sup id="cite_ref-Rhodes2011_56-0" class="reference">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> by starving himself.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Sicily by this time had become an obsession for Carthage. Over the next fifty years, Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in a constant series of skirmishes.

<p>In 315 BC, Agathocles</a>, the tyrant (administrating governor) of Syracuse, seized the city of Messene</a> (present-day Messina). In 311 BC he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty,<sup id="cite_ref-Ray2012_57-0" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> and laid siege to Akragas</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Hamilcar</a>, grandson of Hanno the Great</a>, led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By 310 BC, he controlled almost all of Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland,<sup id="cite_ref-Finley1979_58-0" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles's army was eventually defeated in 307 BC, Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.

<p>Between 280 and 275 BC, Pyrrhus of Epirus</a> waged two major campaigns in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the Roman Republic</a> in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.<sup id="cite_ref-Richard2003_59-0" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Pyrrhus sent an advance guard to Tarentum under the command of Cineaus with 3,000 infantry</a>. Pyrrhus marched the main army across the Greek peninsula and engaged in battles with the Thessalians and the Athenian army. After his early success on the march Pyrrhus entered Tarentum to rejoin with his advance guard.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>In the midst of Pyrrhus's Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of Agrigentum</a>, Syracuse</a>, and Leontini</a>, asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hoyos2011_61-0" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>
Pyrrhus agreed, and fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 infantry</a> and 3,000 cavalry</a><sup id="cite_ref-Cowan2007_62-0" class="reference">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> and 20 war elephants,<sup id="cite_ref-KistlerLair2007_63-0" class="reference">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> supported by some 200 ships. Initially, Pyrrhus's Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of Eryx</a>, even though he was not able to capture Lilybaeum</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to Plutarch</a>, Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Tucker2009_66-0" class="reference">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Pyrrhus's campaigns in Italy were inconclusive, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of <i>Magna Graecia</a></i> meant that Rome absorbed them into its "sphere of influence</a>", bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the Punic Wars</a>.

<p>When Agathocles died in 288 BC, a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves Mamertines</a> (or "sons of Mars"), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.<sup id="cite_ref-Bagnall2008_67-0" class="reference">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In 265 BC, Hiero II</a>, former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyos2007_68-0" class="reference">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup> Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. While the Roman Senate</a> debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero. Alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the Strait of Messina</a>, and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the Punic Wars</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Boardman2001_69-0" class="reference">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by Hannibal Barca</a>, which nearly prevented the rise of the Roman Empire</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>In 256-255 BC the Romans, under the command of Marcus Atilius Regulus</a>, landed in Africa and after suffering some initial defeats the Carthaginian forces eventually repelled the Roman invasion.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoyos2007_68-1" class="reference">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major mercenary revolt</a> which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the Barcid</a> family to prominence),<sup id="cite_ref-AstinFrederiksen1990_70-0" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> and affected Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to base a claim by which it seized Sardinia</a> and Corsica</a>.

<p>The Second Punic War</a> lasted from 218 to 202 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean</a>, with the participation of the Berbers</a> on Carthage's side.<sup id="cite_ref-Daly2003_71-0" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> The war is marked by Hannibal</a>'s surprising overland journey<sup id="cite_ref-SirBridges2006_72-0" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> and his costly crossing of the Alps</a>, followed by his reinforcement by Gaulish allies and crushing victories over Roman armies in the battle of the Trebia</a> and the giant ambush at Trasimene</a>. Against his skill on the battlefield the Romans deployed the Fabian strategy</a>. But because of the increasing unpopularity of this approach, the Romans resorted to a further major field battle.<sup id="cite_ref-Daly2003-p17_73-0" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> The result was the crushing Roman defeat at Cannae</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Fronda2010_74-0" class="reference">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>In consequence many Roman allies went over to Carthage, prolonging the war in Italy for over a decade, during which more Roman armies were destroyed on the battlefield. Despite these setbacks, the Roman forces were more capable in siegecraft<sup id="cite_ref-Kern1999-p262_75-0" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup> than the Carthaginians and recaptured all the major cities that had joined the enemy, as well as defeating a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at the battle of the Metaurus</a>. In the meantime in Iberia, which served as the main source of manpower for the Carthaginian army, a second Roman expedition under Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major</a> took New Carthage</a> by assault<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> and ended Carthaginian rule over Iberia in the battle of Ilipa</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-RosensteinMorstein-Marx2011_77-0" class="reference">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup> The final showdown was the battle of Zama</a> in Africa between Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, resulting in the latter's defeat and the imposition of harsh peace conditions on Carthage, which ceased to be a major power and became a Roman client-state.<sup id="cite_ref-Abulafia2011_78-0" class="reference">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>The Third Punic War</a> (149 to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars.

<p>The government of Carthage changed dramatically after the total rout of the Carthaginian forces at the battle of Himera on Sicily in 483 BC.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference">&#91;84&#93;</a></sup> The Magonid clan</a> was compelled to compromise and allow representative and even some democratic institutions. Carthage remained to a great extent an oligarchal</a> republic</a>, which relied on a system of checks and balances</a> and ensured a form of public accountability. At the head of the Carthaginian state were now two annually elected, not hereditary, Suffets</a> <sup id="cite_ref-Miles130_85-0" class="reference">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup>(thus rendered in Latin by Livy</a> 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SPÎ˜M <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">/ÊƒuftË¤im/</span>, meaning "judges" and obviously related to the Biblical</a> Hebrew</a> ruler title <i lang="he-Latn" title="Hebrew language text">Shophet</i> "Judge</a>"),<sup id="cite_ref-Silva2010_86-0" class="reference">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup>
similar to modern day executive presidents</a>. Greek and Roman authors more commonly referred to them as "kings", as they were in effect, if not in name, the monarchs of Carthage</a>. SPÎ˜ <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">/ÊƒufitË¤/</span> might originally have been the title of the city's governor, installed by the mother city of Tyre.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>In the historically attested period, the two Suffets were elected annually from among the most wealthy and influential families and ruled collegially, similarly to Roman consuls</a> (and equated with these by Livy). This practice might have descended from the plutocratic</a> oligarchies that limited the Suffet's power in the first Phoenician cities.<sup id="cite_ref-Aristotle2012_87-0" class="reference">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup> A range of more junior officials and special commissioners oversaw different aspects of governmental business such as public works, tax-collecting, and the administration of the state treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-Miles130_85-1" class="reference">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference">&#91;88&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>The aristocratic families were represented in a supreme council (Roman sources speak of a Carthaginian "Senate</a>", and Greek ones of a "council of Elders</a>" or a gerousia</a>), which had a wide range of powers; however, it is not known whether the Suffets were elected by this council or by an assembly of the people. Suffets appear to have exercised judicial and executive power, but not military, as generals were chosen by the administration. The final supervision of the Treasury and Foreign Affairs seems to have come under the Council of Elders.<sup id="cite_ref-Miles130_85-2" class="reference">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup>

<p>There was a body known as the Tribunal of the Hundred and Four</a>, which Aristotle compared to the Spartan ephors</a>. These were judges who acted as a kind of higher constitutional court and oversaw the actions of generals,<sup id="cite_ref-Aristotle2012_87-1" class="reference">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup> who could sometimes be sentenced to crucifixion</a>, as well as other officials.

Aristotle</a> reported in his <i>Politics</i></a> that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote&#160;â€” unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as Sparta</a> and Crete</a>. Polybius</a>, in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the people of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline).<sup id="cite_ref-Champion2004_90-0" class="reference">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup> This may have been due to the influence of the Barcid</a> faction.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup>

<p>According to Polybius, Carthage relied heavily, though not exclusively, on foreign mercenaries,<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> especially in overseas warfare. The core of its army was from its own territory in Northwest Africa</a> (ethnic Libyans</a> and Numidians</a> (modern northern Algeria</a>), as well as "Liby-Phoenicians"â€”i.e., Phoenicians proper). These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean, who fought in their own national units; Celts</a> and Balearics</a> and Iberians</a> were especially common. Later, after the Barcids</a> conquered Iberia</a><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual. (May 2017)">dubious</span></a>&#32;<span class="metadata"> &#8211; discuss</a></span></i>&#93;</sup> (modern Spain and Portugal), Iberians</a> came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its Northwest African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of light Numidian cavalry</a>. Other mounted troops included North African elephants</a> (now extinct), trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anticavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants, in case they charged toward their own army. The Carthaginians also fielded troops such as slingers</a>, soldiers armed with straps of cloth used to toss small stones at high speeds.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>The navy of Carthage was one of the largest in the Mediterranean, using serial production</a> to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and marines</a> of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the Phoenician citizenry, unlike the multiethnic allied and mercenary</a> troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt-ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup> The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that training of oarsmen and coxswains occurred in peacetime, giving their navy a cutting edge in naval matters.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>The trade of Carthaginian merchantmen was by land across the Sahara and especially by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic to the tin-rich Cassiterides</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup> and also to Northwest Africa. Evidence exists that at least one Punic expedition, that of Hanno</a>, may have sailed along the West African coast to regions south of the Tropic of Cancer</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyclopedia.2011_97-0" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Polybius</a> wrote in the sixth book of his history that the Carthaginians were "more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people."<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup> Their navy included some 300 to 350 warships. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the First Punic War, managed to finally defeat Carthage with a combination of reverse-engineered, captured Carthaginian ships, recruitment of experienced Greek</a> sailors from the ranks of its conquered cities, the unorthodox corvus</a> device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. In the Third Punic War, Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the numerically superior Romans for a whole day.

<p>Carthaginian commerce extended by sea throughout the Mediterranean and perhaps into the Atlantic as far as the Canary Islands</a>, and by land across the Sahara</a> desert. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians and others had treaties of commerce to regulate their exports and imports.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cunliffe2001_102-0" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup>

The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).<sup id="cite_ref-Lange2004_150-0" class="reference">&#91;150&#93;</a></sup>

There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known why. One explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention via child sacrifice; however, bad times would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in the
tophet.<sup id="cite_ref-Miles2011_174-0" class="reference">&#91;174&#93;</a></sup> The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own. However, Carthage's priests demanded the youth in times of crisis such as war, drought, or famine. Special ceremonies during extreme crisis saw up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families slain and tossed into the burning pyre.<sup id="cite_ref-WalbankAstin1990_175-0" class="reference">&#91;175&#93;</a></sup>
