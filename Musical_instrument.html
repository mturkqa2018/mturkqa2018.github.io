<p>A <b>musical instrument</b> is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds</a>. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet</a> to signal success on the hunt, or a drum</a> in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies</a> for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute</a>, dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle Ages</a>, instruments from Mesopotamia</a> were in maritime Southeast Asia</a>, and Europeans played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_and_basic_operation">Definition and basic operation</span></h2>
<p>A musical instrument makes sounds. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies—for example, by clapping—to using objects to create music from sounds, musical instruments were born.<sup id="cite_ref-Montagu1_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault9_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments. A player sounding a flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of "making music".<sup id="cite_ref-Rault9_2-1" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Musical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from "found objects" such a shells and plant parts.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault9_2-2" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> As instruments evolved, so did the selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault9_2-3" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way—for example, by plucking the strings on a string instrument</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault9_2-4" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Researchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-Blades34_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Scholars agree that there are no completely reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early slit drums</a> involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs60_13-0" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>German musicologist Curt Sachs</a>, one of the most prominent musicologists</a><sup id="cite_ref-Brown_14-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> and musical ethnologists</a><sup id="cite_ref-Baines37_15-0" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials. He maintains, for example, that contemporary anthropologists</a> comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft cannot determine which instruments are more "primitive"</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs61_16-0" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable, however, due to its limited subjectivity.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs63_17-0" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs63_17-1" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Until the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included Jubal</a>, descendant of Cain</a> and "father of all such as handle the harp and the organ", Pan</a>, inventor of the pan pipes</a>, and Mercury</a>, who is said to have made a dried tortoise</a> shell into the first lyre</a>. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive "invention" of the musical instrument since the definition of the term "musical instrument" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a <i>Homo habilis</a></i> slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs297_18-0" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Among the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are rattles</a>, stampers, and various drums</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Blades36_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> These earliest instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs26_20-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault34_21-0" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to modern instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs34_22-0" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the Chukchi people</a> of the Russian Far East</a>, the indigenous people of Melanesia</a>, and many cultures of Africa</a>. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture.<sup id="cite_ref-Blades51_23-0" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> One East African tribe, the Wahinda</a>, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs35_24-0" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Humans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments for producing a melody</a>. Until this time in the evolutions of musical instruments, melody was common only in singing. Similar to the process of reduplication</a> in language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes—one tube would produce a "clear" sound and the other would answer with a "darker" sound. Such instrument pairs also included bullroarers</a>, slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated genders with them; the "father" was the bigger or more energetic instrument, while the "mother" was the smaller or duller instrument. Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest xylophone</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs52_25-0" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia</a>, eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-Marcuse24_26-0" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Along with xylophones, which ranged from simple sets of three "leg bars" to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the ground harp</a>, ground zither</a>, musical bow</a>, and jaw harp</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs53_27-0" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Images of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian</a> and Babylonian</a> cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor</a> and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs67_28-0" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia</a>. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform</a> texts written in Sumerian</a> or Akkadian</a> to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs68_29-0" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, historians have been able to distinguish six idiophones</a> used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra</a>, bells, cymbals, and rattles.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs69_30-0" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Remnant168_31-0" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi</a>, Georgia</a> and among the Native American Yaqui</a> tribe.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs70_32-0" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals.

<p>Musical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs86_34-0" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs86_34-1" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault71_35-0" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Little history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the Kassites</a> destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the Hyksos</a> destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt</a>. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs86_34-2" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom</a> began using oboes</a>, trumpets, lyres</a>, lutes</a>, castanets</a>, and cymbals</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs98_36-0" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Idiophones</a> were extremely important in Chinese music, hence the majority of early instruments were idiophones.

<p>During the period of time loosely referred to as the Middle Ages</a>, China developed a tradition of integrating musical influence from other regions.  The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD, when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in Turkestan</a>. Influences from Middle East, Persia, India, Mongolia, and other countries followed. In fact, Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs207_57-0" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> Cymbals gained popularity, along with more advanced trumpets, clarinets, oboes, flutes, drums, and lutes.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs218_58-0" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> Some of the first bowed</a> zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs216_59-0" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>

Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages.

<p>Beginning in about 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was Sebastian Virdung's</a> 1511 treatise <i>Musica getuscht und ausgezogen</i> ('Music Germanized and Abstracted').<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs298_87-1" class="reference">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup> Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of "irregular" instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including Arnolt Schlick's</a> <i>Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten</i> ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on organ building and organ playing.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs299_89-0" class="reference">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup> Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the <i>Syntagma musicum</i> by Michael Praetorius</a>, is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs301_90-0" class="reference">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>In the sixteenth century, musical instrument builders gave most instruments – such as the violin – the "classical shapes" they retain today. An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound. Therefore, builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship, and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs302_91-0" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of <i>consorts</i>, or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs303_92-0" class="reference">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Instrument builders developed other features that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops</a> emerged in the early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs307_93-0" class="reference">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup> Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes</a> to properly blend into chamber music</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs328_94-0" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Beginning in the seventeenth century, composers began creating works of a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic</a> style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs351_88-1" class="reference">&#91;88&#93;</a></sup> As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs352_95-0" class="reference">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup> Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola</a>, baryton</a>, and various lutes dominated popular music.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs353_96-0" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup> Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the guitar</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs374_97-0" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> As the prevalence of string orchestras</a> rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs380_98-0" class="reference">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>In the mid-seventeenth century, what was known as a hunter's horn underwent transformation into an "art instrument" consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range.

This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs385_100-0" class="reference">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup> Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals. Sachs viewed this trend as a "degeneration" of the general organ sound.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs386_101-0" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Classical_and_Romantic">Classical and Romantic</span></h4>
<p>During the Classical</a> and Romantic</a> periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, a great deal of musical instruments capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs388_102-0" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>Some instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras. Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes—most of them unsuccessful—in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a "defective" range—they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs389_103-0" class="reference">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup> New instruments such as the clarinet, saxophone, and tuba became fixtures in orchestras. Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire "families" of instruments capable of different ranges: small clarinets, normal clarinets, bass clarinets, and so on.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs388_102-1" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Accompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch</a> began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs390_104-0" class="reference">&#91;104&#93;</a></sup> Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz</a>, no standard could be agreed upon.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs391_105-0" class="reference">&#91;105&#93;</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classification">Classification</span></h2>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Musical instrument classification</a></div>
<p>There are many different methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music is produced with the instrument, the range</a> of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra</a> or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group.<sup id="cite_ref-Montagu210_113-0" class="reference">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup> The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.<sup id="cite_ref-Montagu211_114-0" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kartomi176_115-0" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup> The most common types of instrument classifications are strings</a>, brass</a>, woodwind</a>, and percussion</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_systems">Ancient systems</span></h3>
<p>An ancient Hindu system named the <i>Natya Shastra</a></i>, written by the sage Bharata Muni</a> and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion instruments with skin heads; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and "solid", or non-skin, percussion instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-Montagu211_114-1" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by Johannes de Muris</a>, who used the terms <i>tensibilia</i> (stringed instruments), <i>inflatibilia</i> (wind instruments), and <i>percussibilia</i> (all percussion instruments).<sup id="cite_ref-Rault190_116-0" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup> In 1880, Victor-Charles Mahillon</a> adapted the <i>Natya Shastra</i> and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: <i>chordophones</i> (stringed instruments), <i>membranophones</i> (skin-head percussion instruments), <i>aerophones</i> (wind instruments), and <i>autophones</i> (non-skin percussion instruments).<sup id="cite_ref-Montagu211_114-2" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hornbostel-Sachs">Hornbostel-Sachs</span></h3>
<p>Erich von Hornbostel</a> and Curt Sachs</a> adopted Mahillon's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in <i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i> in 1914. Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon's system, but replaced the term <i>autophone</i> with <i>idiophone</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Montagu211_114-3" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>The original Hornbostel-Sachs system classified instruments into four main groups:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p>
<ul><li>Idiophones</a>, which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as claves</a>, xylophone</a>, guiro</a>, slit drum</a>, mbira</a>, and rattle</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Marcuse3_117-0" class="reference">&#91;117&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Membranophones</a>, which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane; they may be drums</a> (further sorted by the shape of the shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but kazoos</a> and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.<sup id="cite_ref-Marcuse117_118-0" class="reference">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Chordophones</a>, which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither</a> whether it is plucked like an autoharp</a> or struck with hammers like a piano</a>. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute</a>, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar</a> or uses a membrane like a banjo</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Marcuse177_119-0" class="reference">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Aerophones</a>, which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a bullroarer</a> or whip</a>, which move freely through the air; flutes</a>, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets</a>, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.<sup id="cite_ref-Marcuse549_120-0" class="reference">&#91;120&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Sachs later added a fifth category, electrophones</a>, such as theremins</a>, which produce sound by electronic means.<sup id="cite_ref-Sachs447_109-2" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by ethnomusicologists</a> and organologists</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault190_116-1" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Campbell39_121-0" class="reference">&#91;121&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Schaeffner">Schaeffner</span></h3>
<p>Andre Schaeffner, a curator at the Musée de l'Homme</a>, disagreed with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones on the basis of sound production, but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.<sup id="cite_ref-Kartomi174_122-0" class="reference">&#91;122&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Range">Range</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Range (music)</a></div>
<p>Musical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>These terms are named after singing voice classifications:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p>
<ul><li>Soprano</a> instruments: flute</a>, violin</a>, soprano saxophone</a>, trumpet</a>, clarinet</a>, oboe</a>, piccolo</a></li>
<li>Alto</a> instruments: alto saxophone</a>, french horn</a>, english horn</a>, viola</a>, alto horn</a></li>
<li>Tenor</a> instruments: trombone</a>, tenor saxophone</a>, guitar</a>, tenor drum</a></li>
<li>Baritone</a> instruments: bassoon</a>, baritone saxophone</a>, bass clarinet</a>, cello</a>, baritone horn</a>, euphonium</a></li>
<li>Bass</a> instruments: double bass</a>, bass guitar</a>, contrabassoon</a>, bass saxophone</a>, tuba</a>, bass drum</a></li></ul>
<p>Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range as part of their name: soprano saxophone</a>, tenor saxophone</a>, baritone horn</a>, alto flute</a>, bass guitar</a>, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass</a>, for example: sopranino saxophone</a>, contrabass clarinet</a>. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C<sub>3</sub> to F♯<sub>6</sub>, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.

<p>The materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault184_123-0" class="reference">&#91;123&#93;</a></sup> Mulberry</a> trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts</a> believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault185_124-0" class="reference">&#91;124&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>Musical instrument construction is a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier</a> makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<sup id="cite_ref-Rault195_125-0" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup> Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments</a>, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User_interfaces">User interfaces</span></h2>
<p>Regardless of how the sound in an instrument is produced, many musical instruments have a keyboard as the user-interface. Keyboard instruments</a> are any instruments that are played with a musical keyboard</a>. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means (pedals</a> for a piano, stops</a> and a pedal keyboard</a> for an organ) to manipulate these sounds. They may produce sound by wind being fanned (organ</a>) or pumped (accordion</a>),<sup id="cite_ref-bicknell_126-0" class="reference">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-howard_127-0" class="reference">&#91;127&#93;</a></sup> vibrating strings either hammered (piano</a>) or plucked (harpsichord</a>),<sup id="cite_ref-fine_128-0" class="reference">&#91;128&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference">&#91;129&#93;</a></sup> by electronic means (synthesizer</a>),<sup id="cite_ref-paradiso_130-0" class="reference">&#91;130&#93;</a></sup> or in some other way. Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the <i>glockenspiel</a></i>, are fitted with one.<sup id="cite_ref-vslglocken_131-0" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup> Though they have no moving parts and are struck by mallets held in the player's hands, they have the same physical arrangement of keys and produce soundwaves in a similar manner.  The theremin</a>, an electrophone</a>, is played without physical contact by the player.
