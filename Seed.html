<p>A <b>seed</b> is an embryonic</a> plant</a> enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction</a> in seed plants, the spermatophytes</a>, including the gymnosperm</a> and angiosperm</a> plants.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule</a>, after fertilization</a> by pollen</a> and some growth within the mother plant.  The embryo</a> is developed from the zygote</a> and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns</a>, mosses</a> and liverworts</a>, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.  Seed plants now dominate biological niches</a> on land, from forests</a> to grasslands</a> both in hot and cold climates</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The term "seed" also has a general meaning that antedates the above—anything that can be sown</a>, e.g. "seed" potatoes</a>, "seeds" of corn</a> or sunflower "seeds"</a>. In the case of sunflower</a> and corn "seeds", what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or husk</a>, whereas the potato is a tuber</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Many structures commonly referred to as "seeds" are actually dry fruits</a>. Plants producing berries are called baccate. Sunflower</a> seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits</a> (such as the peach</a>) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. Nuts</a> are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent</a> seed, such as an acorn</a> or hazelnut</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Seed_Production">Seed Production</span></h2>
<p>Seeds are produced in several related groups of plants, and their manner of production distinguishes the angiosperms</a> ("enclosed seeds") from the gymnosperms</a> ("naked seeds").  Angiosperm seeds are produced in a hard or fleshy structure called a fruit</a> that encloses the seeds for protection in order to secure healthy growth. Some fruits have layers of both hard and fleshy material.  In gymnosperms, no special structure develops to enclose the seeds, which begin their development "naked" on the bracts of cones. However, the seeds do become covered by the cone</a> scales as they develop in some species of conifer</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Seed production in natural plant populations varies widely from year to year in response to weather variables, insects and diseases, and internal cycles within the plants themselves.  Over a 20-year period, for example, forests composed of loblolly pine</a> and shortleaf pine</a> produced from 0 to nearly 5 million sound pine seeds per hectare.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Over this period, there were six bumper, five poor, and nine good seed crops, when evaluated for production of adequate seedlings</a> for natural forest reproduction.

<p>Angiosperm</a> (flowering plants) seeds consist of three genetically distinct constituents: (1) the embryo formed from the zygote, (2) the endosperm, which is normally triploid, (3) the seed coat from tissue derived from the maternal tissue of the ovule. In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with double fertilization</a>, which involves the fusion of two male gametes with the egg cell and the central cell to form the primary endosperm</a> and the zygote.  Right after fertilization, the zygote is mostly inactive, but the primary endosperm divides rapidly to form the endosperm tissue.  This tissue becomes the food the young plant will consume until the roots have developed after germination</a>.

<p>After fertilization the ovules</a> develop into the seeds. The ovule consists of a number of components:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<ul><li>The <b>funicle</b> (<i>funiculus, funiculi</i>) or seed stalk which attaches the ovule to the placenta</a> and hence ovary or fruit wall, at the <b>pericarp</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>nucellus</b>, the remnant of the  megasporangium</a> and main region of the ovule where the megagametophyte develops.</li>
<li>The <b>micropyle</b>, a small pore or opening in the apex of the integument of the ovule where the pollen tube usually enters during the process of fertilization.</li>
<li>The <b>chalaza</b>, the base of the ovule opposite the micropyle, where integument and nucellus are joined together.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The shape of the ovules as they develop often affects the final shape of the seeds.  Plants generally produce ovules of four shapes: the most common shape is called <b>anatropous</b>, with a curved shape. <b>Orthotropous</b> ovules are straight with all the parts of the ovule lined up in a long row producing an uncurved seed. <b>Campylotropous</b> ovules have a curved megagametophyte often giving the seed a tight "C" shape. The last ovule shape is called <b>amphitropous</b>, where the ovule is partly inverted and turned back 90 degrees on its stalk (the funicle or <b>funiculus</b>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In the majority of flowering plants, the zygote's first division is transversely oriented in regards to the long axis, and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufactures nutrients from the endosperm that are used during the embryo's growth.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The main components of the embryo are:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<ul><li>The <b>cotyledons</b>, the seed leaves, attached to the embryonic axis. There may be one (Monocotyledons</a>), or two (Dicotyledons</a>). The cotyledons are also the source of nutrients in the non-endospermic dicotyledons, in which case they replace the endosperm, and are thick and leathery. In endospermic seeds the cotyledons are thin and papery. Dicotyledons have the point of attachment opposite one another on the axis.</li>
<li>The <b>epicotyl</b>, the  embryonic axis above the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s).</li>
<li>The <b>plumule</b>, the tip of the epicotyl, and has a feathery appearance due to the presence of young leaf primordia at the apex, and will become the shoot upon germination.</li>
<li>The <b>hypocotyl</b>, the embryonic axis below the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s), connecting the epicotyl and the radicle, being the stem-root transition zone.</li>
<li>The <b>radicle</b>, the basal tip of the hypocotyl, grows into the primary root.</li></ul>
<p>Monocotyledonous plants have two additional structures in the form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a <b>coleoptile</b> that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a <b>coleorhiza</b> that connects to the primary root and adventitious</a> roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.

<p>The maturing ovule undergoes marked changes in the integuments, generally a reduction and disorganisation but occasionally a thickening. The seed coat forms from the two integuments or outer layers of cells of the ovule, which derive from tissue from the mother plant, the inner integument forms the <b>tegmen</b> and the outer forms the <b>testa</b>.  (The seed coats of some mononocotyledon plants, such as the grasses, are not distinct structures, but are fused with the fruit wall to form a pericarp</a>.) The testae of both monocots and dicots are often marked with patterns and textured markings, or have wings or tufts of hair. When the seed coat forms from only one layer, it is also called the testa, though not all such testae are homologous</a> from one species to the next. The funiculus abscises (detaches at fixed point – abscission zone), the scar forming an oval depression, the <b>hilum</a></b>. Anatropous ovules have a portion of the funiculus that is adnate (fused to the seed coat), and which forms a longitudinal ridge, or <b>raphe</b>, just above the hilum. In bitegmic ovules (e.g. <i>Gossypium</i> described here) both inner and outer integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. With continuing maturation the cells enlarge in the outer integument. While the inner epidermis may remain a single layer, it may also divide to produce two to three layers and accumulates starch, and is referred to as the colourless layer. By contrast the outer epidermis becomes tanniferous</a>. The inner integument may consist of eight to fifteen layers. (Kozlowski 1972)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>As the cells enlarge, and starch is deposited in the outer layers of the pigmented zone below the outer epidermis, this zone begins to lignify, while the cells of the outer epidermis enlarge radially and their walls thicken, with nucleus and cytoplasm compressed into the outer layer. these cells which are broader on their inner surface are called <b>palisade</b> cells. In the inner epidermis the cells also enlarge radially with plate like thickening of the walls. The mature inner integument has a palisade layer, a pigmented zone with 15-20 layers, while the innermost layer is known as the fringe layer. (Kozlowski 1972)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Embryo_2">Embryo</span></h3>
<p>In endospermic seeds, there are two distinct regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo</a> is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant</a> from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon</a> or seed leaf in monocotyledons</a>, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons</a> and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains</a> (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a <b>scutellum</a></b>. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutrient_storage">Nutrient storage</span></h3>
<p>Within the seed, there usually is a store of nutrients</a> for the seedling</a> that will grow from the embryo.  The form of the stored nutrition varies depending on the kind of plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm</a>, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization</a>. It is usually triploid</a>, and is rich in oil</a> or starch</a>, and protein</a>. In gymnosperms, such as conifers</a>, the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid</a> tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the aleurone</a> layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with proteinaceous aleurone grains.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Originally, by analogy with the animal ovum</a>, the outer nucellus layer (perisperm</a>) was referred to as albumen</a>, and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as "albuminous". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with starch</a>, as for instance cereal grains</a>, or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as "fleshy" or "cartilaginous" with thicker soft cells such as coconut</a>, but may also be oily as in <i>Ricinus</a></i> (castor oil), <i>Croton</a></i> and Poppy</a>. The endosperm is called "horny" when the cell walls are thicker such as date</a> and coffee</a>, or "ruminated"  if mottled, as in nutmeg</a>, palms</a> and Annonaceae</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>In most monocotyledons (such as grasses</a> and palms</a>) and some (<b>endospermic</b> or <b>albuminous</b>) dicotyledons (such as castor beans</a>) the embryo is embedded in the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination</a>. In the <b>non-endospermic</b> dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as <b>exalbuminous</b> seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes</a> (such as beans</a> and peas</a>), trees such as the oak</a> and walnut</a>, vegetables such as squash</a> and radish</a>, and sunflowers</a>. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Seed_coat_2">Seed coat</span></h3>
<p>The seed coat develops from the maternal tissue, the integuments</a>, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed can be a paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut</a>) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in honey locust</a> and coconut</a>), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta</a> of pomegranate</a>. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either <b>bitegmic</b> or <b>unitegmic</b>. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified</a> sclereids</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>The outer integument has a number of layers, generally between four and eight organised into three layers: (a) outer epidermis, (b) outer pigmented zone of two to five layers containing tannin</a> and starch, and (c) inner epidermis.  The <b>endotegmen</b> is derived from the inner epidermis of the inner integument, the <b>exotegmen</b> from the outer surface of the inner integument. The <b>endotesta</b> is derived from the inner epidermis of the outer integument, and the outer layer of the testa from the outer surface of the outer integument is referred to as the <b>exotesta</b>. If the exotesta is also the mechanical layer, this is called an exotestal seed, but if the mechanical layer is the endotegmen, then the seed is endotestal. The exotesta may consist of one or more rows of cells that are elongated and pallisade like (e.g. Fabaceae</a>), hence 'palisade exotesta'.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>In addition to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an <b>aril</a></b>, a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle (funiculus</a>), (as in yew</a> and nutmeg</a>) or an oily appendage, an <b>elaiosome</a></b> (as in <i>Corydalis</a></i>), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs are the source of the textile crop cotton</a>. Other seed appendages include the raphe (a ridge), wings, <b>caruncles</b> (a soft spongy outgrowth from the outer integument in the vicinity of the micropyle), spines, or tubercles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>A scar also may remain on the seed coat, called the <b>hilum</a></b>, where the seed was attached to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the ovule.

<p>Seeds are very diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest, with about one million seeds per gram; they are often embryonic seeds with immature embryos and no significant energy reserves. Orchids and a few other groups of plants are mycoheterotrophs</a> which depend on mycorrhizal fungi</a> for nutrition during germination and the early growth of the seedling.  Some terrestrial orchid seedlings, in fact, spend the first few years of their lives deriving energy from the fungi and do not produce green leaves.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> At over 20&#160;kg, the largest seed is the <i>coco de mer</a></i>.  Plants that produce smaller seeds can generate many more seeds per flower, while plants with larger seeds invest more resources into those seeds and normally produce fewer seeds. Small seeds are quicker to ripen and can be dispersed sooner, so fall blooming plants often have small seeds. Many annual plants produce great quantities of smaller seeds; this helps to ensure at least a few will end in a favorable place for growth.  Herbaceous perennials and woody plants often have larger seeds; they can produce seeds over many years, and larger seeds have more energy reserves for germination and seedling growth and produce larger, more established seedlings after germination.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Functions">Functions</span></h2>
<p>Seeds serve several functions for the plants that produce them.  Key among these functions are nourishment of the embryo</a>, dispersal</a> to a new location, and dormancy</a> during unfavorable conditions.  Seeds fundamentally are means of reproduction, and most seeds are the product of sexual reproduction</a> which produces a remixing of genetic material and phenotype</a> variability on which natural selection</a> acts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Embryo_nourishment">Embryo nourishment</span></h3>
<p>Seeds protect and nourish the embryo or young plant. They usually give a seedling a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, because of the larger food reserves in the seed and the multicellularity of the enclosed embryo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispersal">Dispersal</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Seed dispersal</a></div>
<p>Unlike animals, plants are limited in their ability to seek out favorable conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to disperse</a> their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also vegetative reproduction</a>). A seed must somehow "arrive" at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called dehiscent</a>, which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques.  When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, caryopsis, nuts, samaras, and utricles.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Seed dormancy has two main functions: the first is synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory</a>) does not result in the death of all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Seed dormancy is not the same as seed persistence in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Often, seed dormancy is divided into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, physical, and combinational dormancy.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Exogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo, including:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p>
<ul><li><b>Physical dormancy</b> or <b>hard seed coats</b> occurs when seeds are impermeable</a> to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted in response to environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical dormancy occurs include Anacardiaceae</a>, Cannaceae</a>, Convulvulaceae</a>, Fabaceae</a> and Malvaceae</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Chemical dormancy</b> considers species that lack physiological dormancy, but where a chemical prevents germination. This chemical can be leached out of the seed by rainwater or snow melt or be deactivated somehow.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Leaching of chemical inhibitors from the seed by rain water is often cited as an important cause of dormancy release in seeds of desert plants, but little evidence exists to support this claim.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Endogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, including:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p>
<ul><li>In <b>morphological dormancy</b>, germination is prevented due to morphological characteristics of the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before germination can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species specific length is required before germination can occur. Examples of plant families where morphological dormancy occurs are Apiaceae</a>, Cycadaceae</a>, Liliaceae</a>, Magnoliaceae</a> and Ranunculaceae</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Baskin,_C.C_1998_30-0" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Baskin,_J.M_2004_31-0" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Morphophysiological dormancy</b> includes seeds with underdeveloped embryos, and also have physiological components to dormancy. These seeds, therefore, require a dormancy-breaking treatments, as well as a period of time to develop fully grown embryos. Plant families where morphophysiological dormancy occurs include Apiaceae</a>, Aquifoliaceae</a>, Liliaceae</a>, Magnoliaceae</a>, Papaveraceae</a> and Ranunculaceae</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Baskin,_C.C_1998_30-1" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Some plants with morphophysiological dormancy, such as <i>Asarum</a></i> or <i>Trillium</a></i> species, have multiple types of dormancy, one affects radicle (root) growth, while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. The terms "double dormancy" and "two-year seeds" are used for species whose seeds need two years to complete germination or at least two winters and one summer. Dormancy of the radicle (seedling root) is broken during the first winter after dispersal while dormancy of the shoot bud is broken during the second winter.<sup id="cite_ref-Baskin,_C.C_1998_30-2" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Physiological dormancy</b> means the embryo, due to physiological causes, cannot generate enough power to break through the seed coat, endosperm or other covering structures. Dormancy is typically broken at cool wet, warm wet or warm dry conditions. Abscisic acid</a> is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds, and its production can be affected by light.
<ul><li><b>Drying</b>, in some plants, including a number of grasses and those from seasonally arid regions, is needed before they will germinate. The seeds are released, but need to have a lower moisture content before germination can begin. If the seeds remain moist after dispersal, germination can be delayed for many months or even years. Many herbaceous plants from temperate climate zones have physiological dormancy that disappears with drying of the seeds. Other species will germinate after dispersal only under very narrow temperature ranges, but as the seeds dry, they are able to germinate over a wider temperature range.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></li>
<li>In seeds with <b>combinational dormancy</b>, the seed or fruit coat is impermeable to water and the embryo has physiological dormancy. Depending on the species, physical dormancy can be broken before or after physiological dormancy is broken.<sup id="cite_ref-Baskin,_J.M_2004_31-1" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Secondary dormancy</b>* is caused by conditions after the seed has been dispersed and occurs in some seeds when nondormant seed is exposed to conditions that are not favorable to germination, very often high temperatures. The mechanisms of secondary dormancy are not yet fully understood, but might involve the loss of sensitivity in receptors in the plasma membrane.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The following types of seed dormancy do not involve seed dormancy, strictly speaking, as lack of germination is prevented by the environment, not by characteristics of the seed itself (see Germination</a>):
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p>
<ul><li><b>Photodormancy</b> or light sensitivity affects germination of some seeds. These photoblastic seeds need a period of darkness or light to germinate.  In species with thin seed coats, light</a> may be able to penetrate into the dormant embryo. The presence of light or the absence of light may trigger the germination process, inhibiting germination in some seeds buried too deeply or in others not buried in the soil.</li>
<li><b>Thermodormancy</b> is seed sensitivity to heat or cold. Some seeds, including cocklebur and amaranth, germinate only at high temperatures (30&#160;°C or 86&#160;°F); many plants that have seeds that germinate in early to midsummer have thermodormancy, so germinate only when the soil temperature is warm. Other seeds need cool soils to germinate, while others, such as celery, are inhibited when soil temperatures are too warm.  Often, thermodormancy requirements disappear as the seed ages or dries.</li></ul>
<p>Not all seeds undergo a period of dormancy.  Seeds of some mangroves</a> are viviparous; they begin to germinate while still attached to the parent. The large, heavy root allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls. Many garden plant seeds will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough; though their wild ancestors may have had dormancy, these cultivated plants lack it.  After many generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners, dormancy has been selected out.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>For annuals</a>, seeds are a way for the species to survive dry or cold seasons. Ephemeral plants are usually annuals that can go from seed to seed in as few as six weeks.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Seed germination is a process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling. It involves the reactivation of the metabolic pathways that lead to growth and the emergence of the radicle or seed root and plumule or shoot. The emergence of the seedling above the soil surface is the next phase of the plant's growth and is called seedling establishment.<sup id="cite_ref-the_encyclopedia_of_seeds_35-0" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Three fundamental conditions must exist before germination can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called seed viability. (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent germination must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for germination.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Seed viability is the ability of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live for a long time before germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p><b>Seed vigor</b> is a measure of the quality of seed, and involves the viability of the seed, the germination percentage, germination rate and the strength of the seedlings produced.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>The <b>germination percentage</b> is simply the proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The <b>germination rate</b> is the length of time it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by germination percentage plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Environmental conditions affecting seed germination include; water, oxygen, temperature and light.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Three distinct phases of seed germination occur: water imbibition; lag phase; and radicle</a> emergence.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>In order for the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, splitting the seed coat. However, the nature of the seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination</a>. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Repair_of_DNA_damage">Repair of DNA damage</span></h3>
<p>During seed dormancy</a>, often associated with unpredictable and stressful environments, DNA damage</a> accumulates as the seeds age.<sup id="cite_ref-Cheah_38-0" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Koppen_39-0" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-pmid16313635_40-0" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>  In rye</a> seeds, the reduction of DNA integrity due to damage is associated with loss of seed viability during storage.<sup id="cite_ref-Cheah_38-1" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>  Upon germination, seeds of <i>Vicia faba</a></i> undergo DNA repair</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Koppen_39-1" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>  A plant DNA ligase</a> that is involved in repair of single- and double-strand breaks during seed germination is an important determinant of seed longevity.<sup id="cite_ref-pmid20584150_41-0" class="reference">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>  Also, in Arabidopsis</a> seeds, the activities of the DNA repair enzymes Poly ADP ribose polymerases</a> (PARP) are likely needed for successful germination.<sup id="cite_ref-pmid17587307_42-0" class="reference">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup>  Thus DNA damages that accumulate during dormancy</a> appear to be a problem for seed survival, and the enzymatic repair of DNA damages during germination appears to be important for seed viability.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Inducing_germination">Inducing germination</span></h3>
<p>A number of different strategies are used by gardeners and horticulturists to break seed dormancy</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p><b>Scarification</b> allows water and gases to penetrate into the seed; it includes methods to physically break the hard seed coats or soften them by chemicals, such as soaking in hot water or poking holes in the seed with a pin or rubbing them on sandpaper or cracking with a press or hammer.  Sometimes fruits are harvested while the seeds are still immature and the seed coat is not fully developed and sown right away before the seed coat become impermeable.  Under natural conditions, seed coats are worn down by rodents chewing on the seed, the seeds rubbing against rocks (seeds are moved by the wind or water currents), by undergoing freezing and thawing of surface water, or passing through an animal's digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from digestion</a>, while often weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it is deposited, along with a bit of fecal matter that acts as fertilizer, far from the parent plant.  Microorganisms</a> are often effective in breaking down hard seed coats and are sometimes used by people as a treatment; the seeds are stored in a moist warm sandy medium for several months under nonsterile conditions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p><b>Stratification</a></b>, also called moist-chilling, breaks down physiological dormancy, and involves the addition of moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing to overwinter under cool conditions is an effective way to stratify seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which are a part of the natural environment.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p><b>Leaching</b> or the soaking in water removes chemical inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. Rain</a> and melting snow</a> naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, can result in oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p><p>Other methods used to assist in the germination of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sterile_seeds">Sterile seeds</span></h3>
<p>Seeds may be sterile for few reasons: they may have been irradiated, unpollinated, cells lived past expectancy, or bred for the purpose.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Evolution_and_origin_of_seeds">Evolution and origin of seeds</span></h3>
<p>The origin of seed plants is a problem that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle Devonian</a>. The description in 2004 of the proto-seed <i>Runcaria heinzelinii</i> in the Givetian</a> of Belgium</a> is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending spores into the air, that would land and become whole new plants.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>The first "true" seeds are described from the upper Devonian, which is probably the theater of their true first evolutionary radiation. With this radiation came an evolution of seed size</a>, shape, dispersal and eventually the radiation of gymnosperms and angiosperms and monocotyledons</a> and dicotyledons</a>. The seed plants progressively became one of the major elements of nearly all ecosystems.

<p>Many seeds are edible and the majority of human calories comes from seeds,<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> especially from cereals</a>, legumes</a> and nuts</a>. Seeds also provide most cooking oils</a>, many beverages</a> and spices</a> and some important food additives</a>.

It was germinated in 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> (A reported regeneration of <i>Silene stenophylla</a></i> (narrow-leafed campion) from material preserved for 31,800 years in the Siberian</a> permafrost</a> was achieved using fruit tissue, not seed.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup>)</li>
<li>The largest seed is produced by the coco de mer</a>, or "double coconut palm", <i>Lodoicea maldivica</i>.  The entire fruit</a> may weigh up to 23 kilograms (50 pounds) and usually contains a single seed.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The smallest seeds are produced by epiphytic orchids</a>. They are only 85 micrometers long, and weigh 0.81 micrograms. They have no endosperm</a> and contain underdeveloped embryos.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The earliest fossil</a> seeds are around 365 million years old from the Late</a> Devonian</a> of West Virginia</a>.  The seeds are preserved immature ovules</a> of the plant</a> <i>Elkinsia polymorpha</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>

<p>The Book of Genesis</a> in the Old Testament begins with an explanation of how all plant forms began:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></p>
<blockquote><p>And God</a> said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">77</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The Quran</a> speaks of seed germination thus:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">78</span></p>
<blockquote><p>It is Allah</a> Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">79</span></p></blockquote>
