<p>In gamma-ray astronomy</a>, <b>gamma-ray bursts</b> (<b>GRBs</b>) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies</a>. They are the brightest electromagnetic</a> events known to occur in the universe</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> After an initial flash of gamma rays</a>, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray</a>, ultraviolet</a>, optical</a>, infrared</a>, microwave</a> and radio</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released during a supernova</a> or hypernova</a> as a rapidly rotating, high-mass star</a> collapses to form a neutron star</a>, quark star</a>, or black hole</a>. A subclass of GRBs (the "short" bursts) appear to originate from a different process: the merger of binary</a> neutron stars</a>, known as a kilonova</a>. The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision, causing the entire crust of the star to shatter.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The sources of most GRBs are billions of light years</a> away from Earth</a>, implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun</a> will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime)<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years<sup id="cite_ref-rates_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy</a>, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater</a> flares, are associated with magnetars</a> within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction</a> event.<sup id="cite_ref-Melott2004_9-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the Vela satellites</a>, which had been designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests</a>; this was declassified and published in 1973.<sup id="cite_ref-KSO_10-0" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets</a> and neutron stars</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts</a> using optical spectroscopy</a>, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae</a> associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.

<p>Gamma-ray bursts were first observed in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela</a> satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States</a> suspected that the Soviet Union</a> might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</a> in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC</a>, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature.<sup id="cite_ref-FlashVela_12-0" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory</a>, led by Ray Klebesadel</a>, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions</a> of sixteen bursts<sup id="cite_ref-FlashVela_12-1" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.<sup id="cite_ref-KSO_10-1" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Most early theories of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy</a>. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a> (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE</a>) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data that showed the distribution of GRBs is isotropic</a>—not biased towards any particular direction in space.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated in or near the galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way.<sup id="cite_ref-Vedrenne_p._16–40_14-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Piran92_17-0" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.<sup id="cite_ref-Vedrenne_p._16–40_14-1" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lamb_18-0" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Counterpart_objects_as_candidate_sources">Counterpart objects as candidate sources</span></h3>
<p>For decades after the discovery of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs</a>, pulsars</a>, supernovae</a>, globular clusters</a>, quasars</a>, Seyfert galaxies</a>, and BL Lac objects</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-spatial_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> All such searches were unsuccessful,<sup id="cite_ref-790305b_20-0" class="reference">&#91;nb 1&#93;</a></sup> and in a few cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.<sup id="cite_ref-CFishman_23-0" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Several models for the origin of gamma-ray bursts postulated that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst ejecta</a> and interstellar gas.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> This fading emission would be called the "afterglow". Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful, largely because it is difficult to observe a burst's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst. The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite BeppoSAX</a> detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 970228</a><sup id="cite_ref-grbnames_25-0" class="reference">&#91;nb 2&#93;</a></sup>) and when the X-ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated, it detected fading X-ray emission. The William Herschel Telescope</a> identified a fading optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Once the GRB faded, deep imaging was able to identify a faint, distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow.<sup id="cite_ref-Vedrenne_p._90_27-0" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Because of the very faint luminosity of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508</a>. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum</a> of the object revealed a redshift</a> of <i>z</i>&#160;=&#160;0.835, placing the burst at a distance of roughly 6 billion&#160;light years</a> from Earth.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies.<sup id="cite_ref-Vedrenne_p._90_27-1" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425</a> was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw</a>), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue about the nature of the systems that produce GRBs.<sup id="cite_ref-98bw_31-0" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>

However, the revolution in the study of gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift</a>, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed</a> to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi</a> mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor</a>, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope</a>. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network</a>. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>

Energy from the explosion is beamed into two narrow, oppositely directed jets.</div></div></div>
<p>Gamma-ray bursts are very bright as observed from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric</a> flux comparable to a bright star of our galaxy despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B</a>, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude</a> of 5.8,<sup id="cite_ref-Racusin_73-0" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> comparable to that of the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy</a> of the Sun</a> (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).<sup id="cite_ref-Bloom_37-1" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>No known process in the universe can produce this much energy in such a short time. Rather, gamma-ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions, with most of the explosion energy collimated</a> into a narrow jet</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> The approximate angular width of the jet (that is, the degree of spread of the beam) can be estimated directly by observing the achromatic "jet breaks" in afterglow light curves: a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow begins to fade rapidly as the jet slows and can no longer beam</a> its radiation as effectively.<sup id="cite_ref-Sari99_76-0" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees.<sup id="cite_ref-Frail_78-0" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Because their energy is strongly focused, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts are expected to miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter than it would have been were its energy emitted spherically. When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 10<sup>44</sup>&#160;J, or about 1/2000 of a Solar mass</a> (<var>M</var><sub>&#x2609;</sub></a>) energy equivalent<sup id="cite_ref-Frail_78-1" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>—which is still many times the mass-energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5&#160;×&#160;10<sup>41</sup>&#160;J). This is comparable to the energy released in a bright type Ib/c</a> supernova</a> and within the range of theoretical models.

<p>Because of the immense distances of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, identification of the progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae and the fact that their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar</a> model,<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup> in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity</a>, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole</a> in the final stages of its evolution</a>. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk</a>. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets</a> out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup> although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>The closest analogs within the Milky Way galaxy of the stars producing long gamma-ray bursts are likely the Wolf–Rayet stars</a>, extremely hot and massive stars, which have shed most or all of their hydrogen to radiation pressure</a>. Eta Carinae</a> and WR 104</a> have been cited as possible future gamma-ray burst progenitors.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference">&#91;84&#93;</a></sup> It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma-ray burst.<sup id="cite_ref-Stanek_88-0" class="reference">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The massive-star model probably does not explain all types of gamma-ray burst.

The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model.

<p>The means by which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into radiation remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 there was still no generally accepted model for how this process occurs.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup> Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123</a> and to GRB 080319B</a>, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra,<sup id="cite_ref-Racusin_73-1" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup> have suggested that inverse Compton</a> may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons</a> are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>The nature of the longer-wavelength afterglow emission (ranging from X-ray</a> through radio</a>) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself takes the form of matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas</a>, it creates a relativistic</a> shock wave</a> that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron</a> emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup> This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference">&#91;104&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Gamma ray bursts can have harmful or destructive effects on life. Considering the universe as a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy</a> types and their distribution suggests that life as we know it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, <i>z</i>, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for life as we know it, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.<sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference">&#91;106&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference">&#91;107&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>All GRBs observed to date have occurred well outside the Milky Way galaxy and have been harmless to Earth. However, if a GRB were to occur within the Milky Way and its emission were beamed straight towards Earth, the effects could be harmful and potentially devastating for the ecosystems</a>. Currently, orbiting satellites detect on average approximately one GRB per day. The closest observed GRB as of March 2014 was GRB 980425</a>, located 40 megaparsecs (130,000,000&#160;ly)<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference">&#91;108&#93;</a></sup> away (z</a>=0.0085) in an SBc-type dwarf galaxy.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> GRB 980425 was far less energetic than the average GRB and was associated with the Type Ib supernova</a> SN 1998bw</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kippen_et_al._(1998)_113-0" class="reference">&#91;110&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Estimating the exact rate at which GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the Milky Way</a>, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference">&#91;111&#93;</a></sup> Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference">&#91;112&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Since GRBs are thought to involve beamed emission along two jets in opposing directions, only planets in the path of these jets would be subjected to the high energy gamma radiation.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Although nearby GRBs hitting Earth with a destructive shower of gamma rays are only hypothetical events, high energy processes across the galaxy have been observed to affect the Earth's atmosphere.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_on_Earth">Effects on Earth</span></h3>
<p>Earth's atmosphere is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so these types of radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs</a> would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from less than a second to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.<sup id="cite_ref-Threat_118-0" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Effects_119-0" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>The long-term effects from a nearby burst are more dangerous. Gamma rays cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving oxygen</a> and nitrogen</a> molecules</a>, creating first nitrogen oxide</a> then nitrogen dioxide</a> gas. The nitrogen oxides cause dangerous effects on three levels. First, they deplete ozone</a>, with models showing a possible global reduction of 25–35%, with as much as 75% in certain locations, an effect that would last for years. This reduction is enough to cause a dangerously elevated UV index</a> at the surface. Secondly, the nitrogen oxides cause photochemical smog</a>, which darkens the sky and blocks out parts of the sunlight</a> spectrum. This would affect photosynthesis</a>, but models show only about a 1% reduction of the total sunlight spectrum, lasting a few years. However, the smog could potentially cause a cooling effect on Earth's climate, producing a "cosmic winter" (similar to an impact winter</a>, but without an impact), but only if it occurs simultaneously with a global climate instability. Thirdly, the elevated nitrogen levels in the atmosphere would wash out and produce nitric acid rain</a>. Nitric acid</a> is toxic to a variety of organisms, including amphibian life, but models show that it cannot reach levels that would cause a serious global effect. The nitrates</a> might in fact be of benefit to some plants.<sup id="cite_ref-Threat_118-1" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Effects_119-1" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>All in all, a GRB within a few parsecs, with its energy directed towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself and for a few years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.<sup id="cite_ref-Threat_118-2" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Effects_119-2" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup>

<p>GRBs close enough to affect life in some way might occur once every five million years or so — around a thousand times since life on Earth began</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference">&#91;117&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>The major Ordovician–Silurian extinction events</a> 450 million years ago may have been caused by a GRB. The late Ordovician</a> species of trilobites</a> that spent portions of their lives in the plankton</a> layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve</a> species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.<sup id="cite_ref-Melott2004_9-1" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

<p>A Wolf–Rayet star</a> in WR 104, about 8,000 light-years (2,500&#160;pc) away, is considered a nearby GRB candidate that could have destructive effects on terrestrial life. It is expected to explode in a core-collapse-supernova at some point within the next 500,000 years and it is possible that this explosion will create a GRB. If that happens, there is a small chance that Earth will be in the path of its gamma ray jet.<sup id="cite_ref-tuthill_subject_expert_124-0" class="reference">&#91;121&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-time_super_duper_125-0" class="reference">&#91;122&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-tuthill_subject_expert_faq_126-0" class="reference">&#91;123&#93;</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="GRB_candidates_in_the_Milky_Way">GRB candidates in the Milky Way</span></h2>
<p>No gamma-ray burst from within our own galaxy, the Milky Way</a>, has been observed, and the question of whether one has ever occurred remains unresolved. In light of evolving understanding of gamma-ray bursts and their progenitors, the scientific literature records a growing number of local, past, and future GRB candidates. Long duration GRBs are related to superluminous supernovae, or hypernovae, and most luminous blue variables</a> (LBVs), and rapidly spinning Wolf–Rayet stars</a> are thought to end their life cycles in core-collapse supernovae with an associated long-duration GRB. Knowledge of GRBs, however, is from metal-poor galaxies of former epochs of the universe's evolution</a>, and it is impossible to directly extrapolate to encompass more evolved galaxies and stellar environments with a higher metallicity</a>, such as the Milky Way.<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference">&#91;124&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup>
