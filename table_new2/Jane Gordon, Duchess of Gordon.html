<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life_and_family">Early life and family</span></h2>
<p>Jane was the fourth child of Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet of Monreith, and his wife Magdalene Blair. She was born at Myrton Castle, the now ruined castle a short distance from Monreith House, the present seat of the family, which was not built until 50 years later. The Monreith Maxwells were closely related to the Maxwells at Caerlaverock, Earls of Nithsdale who in the 17th century had been considered one of the most powerful families in Scotland. Additionally, their grandmother was the daughter of the 9th Earl of Eglinton, head of the great Ayrshire landowning family and distinguished Member of Parliament.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In 1760, Sir William sold much of his 30,000-acre (12,000Â ha) estate in order to pay debts. In Edinburgh Jane lived together with her mother and her two sisters in a rented second-floor flat in Hyndford's Close near Royal Mile. Titled Scottish landowning families often rented apartments in Edinburgh so their girls could receive further education, be launched on Edinburgh Society, and attend balls. Lady Maxwell moved there, separate from her husband's household, in 1760 with her three daughters: Catherine, 13; Jane, 11; and Eglantine, 9, the future Lady Wallace of Craigie. Sir William continued to live with his sons at Monreith.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Jane's family lived in humble circumstances in Edinburgh, where the children played in the streets. This was where Jane had an accident as a 14-year-old. She somehow got a finger of her right hand jammed in the wheel of a cart which moved away and tore off the finger. There is at Monreith House a letter written by her after the accident, left-handed, explaining how it happened. After this she wore gloves whenever possible, in which a wooden finger replaced the one missing. One of these wooden fingers is still at Monreith House. In later life she used to explain the loss of the finger by saying it was a coaching accident.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>When Jane reached 16 she was so strikingly beautiful that a song was written about her: "Bonnie Jennie of Monreith, the Flower of Galloway". That was also when she fell in love for the first and probably only time. The object of her affections was a young officer who was probably a Fraser, a relative of Lord Lovat. Soon after they met, he left with his regiment, probably to go to America, and word later reached her that he had died.

<p>On 18 October 1767 Jane married the 24-year-old Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. The young Duke lived in the Gordon townhouse almost opposite the Maxwells, and he had inherited a considerable fortune and the title at the age of nine.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>It was while they were on honeymoon at the Fordyceâ€™s country seat, Ayton in Berwickshire, that she received a note from her former love, the young Fraser, very much alive, asking her to marry him. She is said to have read the note and fainted. However, she kept in touch with the young Fraser.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>For the next 20 years, the Duke and Duchess lived at Gordon Castle in Morayshire which Janeâ€™s husband enlarged to be one of the largest homes in Scotlandâ€”with a facade 600 feet long and an 84 foot high central tower. Part of the town of Fochabers had to be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere to make room for the extensions. However, years later most of the enlargements were dismantled again.

<p>At Gordon Castle, Jane organised parties, planted trees, and took a keen interest in farming. She was a great enthusiast for local dancing and fiddle and pipe music. She is credited with establishing the Strathspey as a dance form.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The couple had seven children. Her first son, George, Marquess of Huntly, the later George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon was born in 1770. The Duke also had an illegitimate son at about the same time, also called George, by a Mrs. Christie. Jane used to refer to â€œmy George and the Dukeâ€™s Georgeâ€.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Patronage_of_Robert_Burns">Patronage of Robert Burns</span></h2>
<p>Jane entertained on an increasingly lavish scale, with as many as 100 sitting down to dinner and guests staying for three months in the Castle. And in the 1780s, the Duchess started entertaining in Edinburgh, quickly becoming the leading hostess. Jane was the sole arbitress of fashion in Edinburgh. Horace Walpole called her the â€œEmpress of fashionâ€. She regularly gave soirÃ©e evenings where up and coming artists were asked to entertain. It was in her drawing room that Robert Burns first read his poetry to Edinburgh society, and she became his chief sponsor, purchasing all his early published works.

<p>In 1787 the Duke and the Duchess of Gordon moved to London. They first rented a house on Downing Street from Lord Sheffield, then one in Pall Mall from the Marquess of Buckingham, and finally one in St. James's Square. And Jane continued her party-giving habit, but with a distinctly Scottish flavour. She made everyone dance Scottish dances. King George III adored her, and she supported the King, so she was allowed to promote her Scottish heritage more than others would have dared. She gave a ball at which she and the Duchess of York dressed in tartan when it was officially banned, and she arranged for the King to inspect troops dressed in tartan in Hyde Park.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>It was in the Pall Mall house that she held her greatest parties. Close to Parliament in Westminster, she kept open house for the Tories. Pitt, the Prime Minister, and Dundas, the Lord Advocate, were frequent visitors. And it was during this time that she arranged a truce between the King and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, whose had run up enormous debts. She arranged for his debts to be met, and this enabled the construction of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton to be continued.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Raising_of_the_Gordon_Highlanders">Raising of the Gordon Highlanders</span></h3>
<p>In 1793, the  French Revolutionary Government declared war on Great Britain. At that time the British army was short of recruits, since the military service was not very popular among the young men. As a consequence the Government asked Janeâ€™s husband, the Duke of Gordon, to raise another regiment. The outcome of this was a bet between Jane and the Prince of Wales, the future King George IV. Jane bet with the Prince that she could raise more men than he, meaning the Government. Although 45 by then, she was still extremely attractive. Her recruiting technique was, to say the least, unusual. She wore a military uniform and a large black feathered hat (highland bonnet), touring Scotland to organise reels. Anyone who joined the reel joined the army and received the Kingâ€™s shilling, the recruiting payment, from between the Duchessâ€™ lips by kissing her. This was how the Gordon Highlanders were founded. Her total was 940 men. On 24 June 1794, the newly embodied regiment paraded for the first time at Aberdeen. The regiment existed until 1994.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinrara_House">Kinrara House</span></h2>
<p>In 1799, Jane became depressed and ill. Her eldest son, George, the later George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon, had gone off to the wars, and she wrote in a letter to a friend: â€œOh where and oh where has my highland laddie gone?â€ Her second son, Alexander (1785â€“1808), died at 23, and her husband had moved his mistress, Jane Christie, into Gordon Castle and built a small house on the Spey, called Kinrara, for his estranged wife. Jane lived there for the next six years, continuing her entertaining and partying.

It was said that Rachel was the daughter of Jane's daughter Georgiana and Edwin Henry Landseer.</div></div></div>
<p>Having enjoyed life as a Duchess, Jane was determined to get her daughters well married, and she set out securing suitable husbands for them. In 1802, after the Peace of Amiens, she took her younger daughter, Georgiana (1781â€“1853), to Paris with a view to marrying her to the son of the Empress JosÃ©phine, EugÃ¨ne de Beauharnais. This would not have been popular so soon after hostilities, but nothing came of it. A short time later, Georgiana was reputed to be friendly, if not engaged, to Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, but he died before they could marry. Jane then arranged a meeting with the Dukeâ€™s younger brother John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford who had inherited the title and recently been widowed with several children. All went as planned, and he soon married his late brotherâ€™s fiancÃ©e on 23 June 1803 in London. Georgiana had ten children by the Duke, and she followed in her motherâ€™s partying footsteps, entertaining frequently in her Bedford home, Woburn Abbey. The Duchess of Bedford was a great patroness of the arts, and had a long-standing relationship with the painter Sir Edwin Henry Landseer.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Jane then turned to finding a husband for Charlotte (1768â€“1842), the eldest daughter. She plotted to have her marry William Pitt, the Prime Minister, but her plan failed when Pittâ€™s close friend, Lord Henry Dundas, took an interest in Charlotte. Neither potential husband worked out, and Charlotte later married on 9 September 1789 at Gordon Castle Colonel Charles Lennox, the future 4th Duke of Richmond.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>General Cornwallis had returned to England from his disastrous command of the British troops during the American Revolution to be, rather surprisingly, treated as a hero and created a Marquess. Having fought with Janeâ€™s brother at Plessey in India as well as in the American war, he would have been a friend of Janeâ€™s. So his eldest son, Lord Brome, was therefore considered suitable for Louisa (1776â€“1850), the fourth daughter. Cornwallis refused to approve the marriage, however, citing madness in the Gordon family. The duchess allayed his fears by swearing that there was â€œnot one drop of Gordon bloodâ€ in this particular daughter. The marriage then proceeded on 17 April 1795 in London. History does not relate who Louisaâ€™s natural father was, but it is thought to have been Captain Fraser, her early love from Edinburgh.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Susan (1774â€“1828), the third daughter, was married on 7 October 1793 in Edinburgh to William Montagu, 5th Duke of Manchester, and Madeleine (1772â€“1847), the second daughter, married firstly on 2 April 1789 in London to Sir Robert Sinclair, 7th Baronet. On 25 November 1805 she married secondly at Kimbolton Castle to Charles Fysche Palmer.

<p>Janeâ€™s own marriage had been more or less an arrangement from the beginning. The return from the dead of her first love during the honeymoon was an inauspicious start. The Duke having an illegitimate son by Jane Christie at the same time as his heir was born was an unfortunate sequence, to be followed by the birth of his illegitimate daughter a few years later. The Duke openly kept his mistress at Gordon Castle while the Duchess seems to have preferred assignations with her lover on the windswept moors.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>By 1805, the marriage was officially over, and the couple reached a financial agreement whereby the Duchess would be given a new house, capital payments, and generous annual payments. The Duke was by then in financial difficulties, however; he acknowledged his liability to the Duchess, but he did not pay all the monies legally due her.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Jane was reduced to living in hotels, and she became increasingly eccentric. She was involved in an acrimonious dispute with her estranged husband over money, and she died in 1812 at Poultneyâ€™s Hotel, Piccadilly, London, surrounded by her four daughters and surviving son. Her body was taken north to be buried at the old Celtic Chapel by the banks of the Spey at Kinrara. There her husband carried out her final wish and erected a monument to her on which were recorded the marriages of her children.

<p>Jane, Duchess of Gordon, was painted by most of the leading English portrait painters like George Romney, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Henry Raeburn and Daniel Gardner, but she was known for her intelligence, infectious laugh, and sense of humour as well as her looks. She appears to have had an enormous amount of energy which she directed towards helping what she considered good causes. She left her mark on history by what she did to get Scotland and Scottish culture accepted by the new Kings of Great Britain with German roots.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>And she is remembered in the lines of Robert Burns, of whose poetry she was an important early patroness:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p>
<div class="poem" style="margin-left: 5em;">
<p>She kiltit up her kirtle weel<br/>
To show her bonie cutes sae smaâ€™,<br/>
And walloped about the reel,<br/>
The lightest louper oâ€™ them aâ€™!<br/>
<br/>
While some, like slavâ€™ring, doited stots<br/>
Stoitâ€™ring out throâ€™ the midden dub,<br/>
Fankit their heels amang their coats<br/>
And gart the floor their backsides rub;<br/>
<br/>
Gordon, the great, the gay, the gallant,<br/>
Skipâ€™t like a maukin owre a dyke:<br/>
Deil tak me, since I was a callant,<br/>
Gif e-er my een beheld the like!
