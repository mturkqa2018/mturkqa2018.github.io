<p><b>Occam's razor</b> (also <b>Ockham's razor</b> or <b>Ocham's razor</b>; Latin</a>: <i>lex parsimoniae</i> "<b>law of parsimony</b>") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the right one. When presented with competing hypotheses</a> to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to William of Ockham</a> (c. 1287–1347), who was an English Franciscan</a> friar, scholastic philosopher, and theologian.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>In science, Occam's razor is used as an abductive</a> heuristic</a> in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.<sup id="cite_ref-fn_(100)_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-fn_(101)_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In the scientific method</a>, Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic</a> or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability</a> criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with <i>ad hoc</i> hypotheses</a> to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-fn_(109)_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-fn_(110)_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-fn_(114)_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The term <i>Occam's razor</i> did not appear until a few centuries after William of Ockham</a>'s death in 1347. Libert Froidmont</a>, in his <i>On Christian Philosophy of the Soul</i>, takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "<i>novacula occami</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" (<i lang="la" title="Latin language text">Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate</i>) was formulated by the Irish Franciscan</a> philosopher John Punch</a> in his 1639 commentary on the works of Duns Scotus</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-commentary_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as John Duns Scotus</a> (1265–1308), Robert Grosseteste</a> (1175–1253), Maimonides</a> (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even Aristotle</a> (384–322&#160;BC).<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Aristotle writes in his <i>Posterior Analytics</a></i>, "We may assume the superiority <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">ceteris paribus</i> [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Ptolemy</a> (<span class="nowrap">c. AD 90 – c. AD 168</span>) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."<sup id="cite_ref-Franklin_12-0" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century scholastic</a> writing.<sup id="cite_ref-Franklin_12-1" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Robert Grosseteste, in <i>Commentary on</i> [Aristotle's] <i>the Posterior Analytics Books</i> (<i>Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros</i>) (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The <i>Summa Theologica</a></i> of Thomas Aquinas</a> (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to God's existence</a>, an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. <i>quinque viae</a></i>), and specifically, through an argument based on causality</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also Correlation does not imply causation</a>).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="William_of_Ockham">William of Ockham</span></h3>
<p>William of Ockham</a> (<i>circa</i> 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and theologian</a>, an influential medieval philosopher</a> and a nominalist</a>. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term <i>razor</i> refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> one can cite statements such as <i>Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate</a></i> [Plurality must never be posited without necessity], which occurs in his theological work on the 'Sentences of Peter Lombard'</a> (<i>Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi</i> (ed. Lugd., 1495), i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem</i> (entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> are absent in his extant works;<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> this particular phrasing comes from John Punch</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> who described the principle as a "common axiom" (<i>axioma vulgare</i>) of the Scholastics.<sup id="cite_ref-commentary_8-1" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the Eucharist</a>, a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.<sup id="cite_ref-Franklin_12-2" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>This principle is sometimes phrased as "<i lang="la" title="Latin language text">pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate</i>" ("plurality should not be posited without necessity").<sup id="cite_ref-Britannica_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> In his <i>Summa Totius Logicae</i>, i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, <i lang="la" title="Latin language text">Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora</i> (<i>It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"). (Thorburn, 1918, pp.&#160;352–53; Kneale</a> and Kneale, 1962, p.&#160;243.)</i>

<p>To quote Isaac Newton</a>, "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."<sup id="cite_ref-Hawking_20-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Bertrand Russell</a> offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Around 1960, Ray Solomonoff</a> founded the theory of universal inductive inference</a>, the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_23-0" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_24-0" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Another technical approach to Occam's razor is ontological parsimony</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Baker_26-0" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aesthetic">Aesthetic</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from theology</a>. Thomas Aquinas</a> made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Empirical">Empirical</span></h3>
<p>Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In the related concept of overfitting</a>, excessively complex models are affected by statistical noise</a> (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better predictive</a> performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. model selection</a>, test set</a>, minimum description length</a>, Bayesian inference</a>, etc.).

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Testing_the_razor">Testing the razor</span></h4>
<p>The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

<p>Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an ad hoc hypothesis</a>. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as consilience</a>, can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

<p>One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic probability theory</a>. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by Harold Jeffreys</a> and E.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_philosophers">Other philosophers</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</span></h4>
<p>Karl Popper</a> argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its falsifiability</a> criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Elliott_Sober">Elliott Sober</span></h4>
<p>The philosopher of science Elliott Sober</a> once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.<sup id="cite_ref-Sober975_39-0" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an epistemic</a> justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a <i>sui generis</a></i> existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"<sup id="cite_ref-Sober2002_40-0" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Richard_Swinburne">Richard Swinburne</span></h4>
<p>Richard Swinburne</a> argues for simplicity on logical grounds:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p>
<style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r856303468">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate a priori epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><div class="templatequotecite">—&#8201;<cite>Swinburne 1997</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see Underdetermination</a> and Duhem-Quine thesis</a>), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biology">Biology</span></h3>
<p>Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in evolutionary biology</a>: the units of selection controversy and systematics</a>. George C. Williams</a> in his book <i>Adaptation and Natural Selection</a></i> (1966) argues that the best way to explain altruism</a> among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as Morgan's Canon</a>: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>However, more recent biological analyses, such as Richard Dawkins</a>' <i>The Selfish Gene</a></i>, have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent</a> features of evolution.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Zoology</a> provides an example. Muskoxen</a>, when threatened by wolves</a>, form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>Systematics</a> is the branch of biology</a> that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that genealogy</a> alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is <i>cladistic parsimony</i>. Cladistic parsimony (or maximum parsimony</a>) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of phylogenetic trees</a> (more specifically, cladograms). Cladograms</a> are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or long branch attraction</a>). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see Elliott Sober</a>'s <i>Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference</i> (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. Likelihood</a> methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ information theory</a>, a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Francis Crick</a> has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>In biogeography</a>, parsimony is used to infer ancient migrations</a> of species</a> or populations</a> by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing organisms</a>. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Existence of God</a></div>
<p>In the philosophy of religion</a>, Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the existence of God</a>. William of Ockham</a> himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of revelation</a> and faith</a>. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, in the <i>Summa Theologica</a></i>, uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In turn, Aquinas answers this with the <i>quinque viae</a></i>, and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard</a>, who viewed belief in God as a leap of faith</a> that sometimes directly opposed reason.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark</a>'s presuppositional apologetics</a>, with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also Fideism</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>Various arguments in favor of God</a> establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of George Berkeley</a> (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against materialism</a>, stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find solipsism itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> and Napoleon</a>. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of Lagrange</a>, appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's atheism</a>, more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of methodological naturalism</a>, or even simply that the fewer logical premises</a> one assumes, the stronger</a> is one's conclusion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), J. J. C. Smart</a> invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over spirit-body dualism</a>. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. Paul Churchland</a> (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of folk psychology</a> including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Penal_ethics">Penal ethics</span></h3>
<p>In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of punishment</a> in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the utilitarian</a> approach to the philosophy of punishment, Jeremy Bentham</a>'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of proportionality</a>. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern restorative justice</a>, and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the prison abolition movement</a>. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the sensibility</a> of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor</a> to calculate the expected value of an action.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><p>There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in statistical inference</a>, and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on Bayes factors</a> and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as Akaike information criterion</a>, Bayesian information criterion</a>, Variational Bayesian methods</a>, false discovery rate</a>, and Laplace's method</a> are used. Many artificial intelligence</a> researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on Occam Learning</a> or more generally on the Free energy principle</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term <i>simplicity</i>, and that definition can vary. For example, in the Kolmogorov</a>–Chaitin</a> minimum description length</a> approach, the subject must pick a Turing machine</a> whose operations describe the basic operations <i>believed</i> to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Objective_razor">Objective razor</span></h4>
<p>The minimum instruction set of a universal Turing machine</a> requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the Kolmogorov complexity</a> of most practical theories.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Anti-razors">Anti-razors</span></h2>
<p>Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. Walter Chatton</a> (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own <i>anti-razor:</i> "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution <i>Se non è vero, è ben trovato</i> ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">75</span></p><p>Anti-razors have also been created by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> (1646–1716), Immanuel Kant</a> (1724–1804), and Karl Menger</a> (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a principle of plenitude</a>, as Arthur Lovejoy</a> has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></p><p>Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words. (May 2015)">who?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> might say) even more extremist anti-razor is 'Pataphysics</a>, the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by Alfred Jarry</a> (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges</a> in his story/mock-essay "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius</a>". There is also Crabtree's Bludgeon</a>, which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."
