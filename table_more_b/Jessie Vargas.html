He's my fighter and he wants [Khan]." Speaking on a radio show, Vargas said, "He keeps saying he wants to fight Floyd.  If he really wants to fight Floyd then he has to fight me first."

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Light_welterweight">Light welterweight</span></h3>

Speaking to Boxing Scene, he said, "I know I can still make the weight. I was on weight early for my last fight. I even ate before the weigh in and I didn't have any problems."

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vargas_vs._Allakhverdiev">Vargas vs. Allakhverdiev</span></h4>
<p>On January 30, 2014 it was announced that Vargas would get his first opportunity to fight for a world title on the Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley II PPV card on HBO on April 12 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Nevada.

On fight night, Vargas claimed his first world title defeating Allakhverdiev via unanimous decision. Vargas used head movement, quick jabs and well-placed uppercuts to help get the win on the scorecards. The three judges' scored the fight 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 in favour of Vargas. ESPN's Dan Rafael scored the fight 115-113 for Allakhverdiev, as did HBO's unofficial scorer Harold Lederman. In the post-fight, Vargas said, "I thought I should have been busier earlier in the fight and I got stronger and I thought I took control midway through the fight. This was my first 12-round fight. I worked hard for three months in the Top Rank gym. This fight, this win will make me an even better fighter." Allakhverdiev claimed he wanted a rematch straight away. For the fight, Allakhverdiev took home $250,000  whilst Vargas had a $90,000 purse.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vargas_vs._Novikov">Vargas vs. Novikov</span></h4>
<p>Vargas vacated the IBO title. In May, Boxing Scene stated Vargas would make his first defence against Russian boxer Anton Novikov (29-0, 10 KOs), although a deal was not finalized. The same source stated the bout would feature on the undercard of Brandon Rios vs. Diego Chaves on August 2, 2014 in either Las Vegas or Fresno. On June 6, the fight was confirmed to take place at The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Vargas was excited the bout would be taking place in his home town. As Part of the negotiations, Vargas agreed to random drug testing by VADA. At the same time, Novikov hadn't yet agreed to the drug testing, although he was offered a sponsorship to cover the costs. Novikov failed a post fight drug test in 2012 after he won the vacant WBC silver welterweight title against Karlo Tabaghua in Russia. Novikov's promoter Steve Bash did not mention the drug testing until a month later. Novikov said in regards to the drug testing, â€œI donâ€™t mind any type of testing. The people who are winning fights should win them fairly.â€ In what was said to be another controversial decision, Vargas retained his WBA title after 12 rounds. The three judges' scorecards read 118-111, 118-111 and 117-111. ESPN and BadLeftHook scored the fight closer in favour of Novikov. Vargas started the fight well pressing the action and making Novikov miss. Novikov began to take control after round five, but tired a few rounds later. In the championship rounds, Novikov landed several hard shots to the body and head of Vargas, however it was Vargas that ended the fight the strongest. CompuBox stats showed that Vargas landed 191 of 783 punches thrown (24%), which including 153 power shots landed. Novikov landed 223 of his 812 shots (27%), which included 151 power shots landed. Vargas said of the win, "I can be even better. It was a rough fight. I landed the cleaner punches." ESPN reported that Vargas earned $125,000 and Novikov earned a $105,000 purse. The fight averaged of 728,000 viewers on HBO, peaking at 839,000 viewers.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vargas_vs._DeMarco">Vargas vs. DeMarco</span></h4>
<p>On September 16, 2014 Top Rank promoter Bob Arum announced that Vargas would be making his second title defence on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao vs. Chris Algieri at The Venetian Macao in Macau, SAR on November 22 against 28 year old Mexican boxer and former lightweight world champion Antonio DeMarco (31-3-1, 23 KOs). On announcement, Vargas said, "My opponent is a tough, rugged fighter who comes to fight. I know this will be a fight that fans throughout the world will enjoy. This is very exciting for our team to be part of an event of this magnitude. I plan on bringing my world title belt back to Las Vegas." Vargas began training with former pound for pound king of the 90's, Roy Jones Jr.. There was talks between Vargas and Arum before the fight. Arum stated there would be some big opportunities for Vargas in 2015. The fight went the distance with Vargas earning a unanimous decision win to retain his world title. All three judges' scored the fight 116-112  in favour of Vargas. Vargas, who is usually a defensive style fighter, showed a more offensive approach. This was most likely due to Jones being his new trainer. Both fighters were accurate with their punching, landing at a connect rate of over 40%. DeMarco announced his retirement after the fight.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vargas_vs._Bradley">Vargas vs. Bradley</span></h4>
<p>On April 30, 2015 it was announced that Vargas would be making his welterweight debut against former two-weight world champion Timothy Bradley (31-1-1, 12 KOs) on June 27 at StubHub Center in Carson, California. It was later announced the bout would be contested for the WBO interin title. On May 29, Vargas replaced Jones as his trainer with former world champion Erik Morales. A small crowd of 4,311 was announced. Bradley pretty much dominated the exchanges throughout, punishing Vargas repeatedly to the body and head. While absorbing major damage, Vargas had showed the ability to hurt Bradley and with 20 seconds left in round 12  landed a massive punch that buckled Bradley's knees and had him stumbling across the ring. Vargas followed him and landed 2 more head shots before being tied up near the ropes. Referee Pat Russell heard the 10 second warning and mistakenly signaled that the fight was over with 7â€“8 seconds remaining. Vargas believed he had TKO'd  Bradley  and celebrated atop the turnbuckle. When order was restored it was ruled that the referee's mistake was impossible to fix and the fight would go to the scorecards. Bradley, at that point, deserved the unanimous decision. The judges scored the fight 115-112, 116-112 &amp; 117-111 all in Bradley's favour. Vargas had called for a rematch.

He's working a bit, he's in it. Sounded like the bell to me. But you don't always hear the 10-second warning. You'd like to, but what I thought I heard was the bell. I made the call that I made based upon what I heard. That's all I can say. It was an honest call based on an honest reaction." The fight averaged 1.121 million viewers and peaked at 1.228 million on HBO.

The judges scored the fight 114-113, 118-109 and 118-109 in favour of Pacquiao. Vargas thought he had done enough to retain his title, after the first score of 114-113 was read, he climbed on to the corner raising his arms in the air, only for Pacquiao to be read out the eventual victor. After a steady first round, Pacquiao woke the crowd up in the second round when he hit Vargas with a straight left hand that put him on the mat. The knockdown set the tone for the rest of the fight which had action back and forth. Vargas seemed to have picked up in the middle rounds, but it was Pacquiao who was the more dominant one throughout the 12-rounds. Vargas managed to land a few hard right hands, but none were enough to turn the scores in his favour. In the post-fight interview, Vargas had no excuses, claiming he 'lost to a legend'. CompuBox stats showed Pacquiao as the more accurate of the two, landing 147 of 409 punches (36%). Vargas landed on 104 of his 562 thrown (19%).
