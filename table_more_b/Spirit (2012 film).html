<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>According to the director, "The movie does not, in any way, advocate or proscribe alcohol. <i>Spirit</i> discusses the subject and examines what happens when a person, however intelligent, falls prey to an addiction, any addiction for that matter."

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Raghunandan is an ex-banking executive of Bank of England who resigned his lucrative job because he was bored with the rather sedentary and mundane nature of his work. Having lived in different parts of the world as a banker, he chose journalism as his next career and worked in different cities in India. He now works for a TV news channel as an interviewer in a popular show named "Show the Spirit". In the meantime, he is in the process of writing an English novel too. He is essentially a loner but is a compulsive alcoholic and has an expensive collection of vintage drinks at home.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>It was his excessive drinking that resulted in his divorce some years back, but he shares a healthy friendship with his ex-wife Meera and her current husband Alexy. The couple has custody of Raghunandan's and Meeraâ€™s son Aditya a.k.a. Sunny, who is deaf and mute. Captain Nambiar is jovial his next door neighbour. Raghunandan, however, is not really bothered about relationships, friendships or the norms of society and prefers to live life on his own terms. He rubs off some powerful politicians, who come to his TV show threatening dire consequences and offering bribes, the wrong way and doesn't regret it.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Raghunandan's fatal addiction towards alcohol takes a heavy toll on his personal and professional life. However, good sense dawns, albeit late, when he comes across a man who is worse than him because of his drinking problem. That is plumber Mani who is so drunk that he cannot distinguish between what is real and unreal. His character manifests all the worst characteristics of an alcoholic, including abusing his wife. Mani changes everything, bringing some meaning to Raghunandan's life.

<p>Ranjith has scripted some of the finest films in Mohanlal's career like <i>Devasuram</i>, <i>Aaraam Thampuran</i> and <i>Narasimham</i>. But the two were not in good terms for a while, perhaps after the dud called <i>Rock N' Roll</i>. The two are now coming together, after a brief hiatus through <i>Spirit</i>. Ranjith makes it clear that he opted for Mohanlal as he felt he was the best for this character.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Talking about the film, Ranjith explains: "I believe there are two kinds of people in Kerala. On one hand, you have intelligent, successful people who become slaves to alcohol. They cannot function without it. As a result of it, their families suffer. Many of these alcoholics have marital problems and often, physically and emotionally, abuse their spouse. On the other, there are many others who are not teetotallers but they don't need booze 24X7 to keep them in good spirits," says Ranjith.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>After the success of <i>Indian Rupee</i>, Ranjith announced his new film <i>Leela</i> which was an adaptation of Unni. R's short story of the same name. But the project was postponed and Ranjith began the works of <i>Spirit</i>. According to Shankar Ramakrishnan, who was to play the lead in <i>Leela</i>, "<i>Leela</i> has a landscape and a mindscape and the film was postponed as it requires us [the crew] to travel from Kottayam to Wayanad." Ranjith completed the film's script in a short time and the whole film, including post-production works, was completed in about a month. The principal photography of the film started in March 2012 and was completed by mid-April. The film was shot mainly from Kochi and the "Casa Rosa resort" in the film was set in Choice house in Kochi. It was produced by Antony Perumbavoor under the banner Aashirvad Cinemas. Prakash Raj was initially cast for the role of Alexy but he opted out reportedly due to payment issues. He was replaced by Shankar Ramakrishnan who makes his debut as an actor.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Release">Release</span></h2>
<p>A premiere show was held on 10 June 2012 in Chennai where it garnered good responses. Noted filmmakers and writers such as Priyadarshan, M. P. Virendra Kumar and Anjali Menon were all praise for the film with special mention to Mohanlal's performance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Originally set to release on 7 June 2012, <i>Spirit</i> opened in more than 100 theatres a week later, on 14 June 2012 with good results. The film was screened in 84 centres in Kerala while the Chennai, Mumbai and Bangalore sector had the film in around 20 centres. The movie was reportedly well received by the audiences who opined that it is a class affair with a fine script from the director. Most of them suggested that it gives a good message to the youth who is addicted to alcohol.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The film was screened in front of several politicians and ministers such as K. Babu, Ramesh Chennithala, N. Sakthan, Mullakkara Ratnakaran, A. P. Abdullakutty, P. C. Vishnunath and Dominic Presentation on 21 June 2012 at Sreekumar Theatre, Thiruvananthapuram. The show was presided over by about fifty legislative assembly members and other politicians who were all praise for the film. P. C. Vishnunath suggested the Ministry of Entertainment exempt the film from entertainment taxes stating that the film carries a good message. In late-June, the decision to exempt the film from the tax was announced in the assembly by Minister for Panchayats and Social Welfare M. K. Muneer. "The film created an awareness on social issues faced by the society due to increase in liquor consumption," M. K. Muneer said. The Minister also congratulated the film's crew including Mohanlal and Ranjith for presenting a value oriented film to Malayalam film industry. Central minister Vayalar Ravi has written to the Ministry of Broadcasting to screen the film all over India through Doordarshan television channels.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accusation_of_plagiarism">Accusation of plagiarism</span></h3>
<p>Abdul Azeez, a short filmmaker and assistant director, has accused that <i>Spirit</i> is plagiarised from his short film <i>My Hero But Big Zero</i>. He adds that Plumber Maniyan, the character played by Nandu in <i>Spirit</i>, was entirely based on the protagonist of his film.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h3>
<p>Performance of Nandu as Plumber Maniyan was particularly praised.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Paresh C Palicha of Rediff.com gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 stars and said, "<i>Spirit</i> is not flawless but is recommended for the sincere effort by the cast and the crew." In regards to Mohanlal's performance, the critic said: "<i>Spirit</i> belongs to Mohanlal who brings to the table a kind of vulnerability hidden behind the arrogant exterior. There are occasions when the mask of arrogance falls away and Mohanlal has the expertise to handle such situations with Ã©lan."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>A review by Sify.com said, "If you are not expecting a high voltage drama stuffed with the usual share of emotions, <i>Spirit</i> can turn out to be a nice experience. It may not bowl you over like some of Ranjithâ€™s brilliant movies and seems to be a bit too long, at nearly two hours and thirty minutes. Still, this one has been made with noble intentions."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The film received negative reviews as well. Parvathy Anoop of <i>Deccan Herald</i> stated, "There are too many characters and side stories, some of which are not relevant at all. Also, it [the film] has too many disconnects. Some ideas are introduced and left incomplete, which is a shame. All the drinking, smoking and swearing in this movie seem to have gone waste as it does not drive the message strongly. Mohanlal, as always, has done his part well, but Ranjith had set his own bar high with movies like Pranchiyettan and Indian Rupee and this one does not come anywhere close to that league." Dalton L, in his review for <i>Deccan Chronicle</i>, criticised Mohanlal's acting: "Mohanlal acts like heâ€™s never really been sloshed in his entire life; the only indications to the contrary being his trembling fingers, the clichÃ©d dazed look, and an occasional stagger. He should learn a thing or two from Thilakanâ€™s sterling performance. Kalpana and Nandu too get real." He gave the film a rating of three in a scale of five.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Sreenath Nair of <i>The Hindu</i> said that the film "lacks punch and kick". He praised the film's art direction and acting by Mohanlal and Nandu but was critical about the film's cinematography, dialogues and background score. He particularly criticised the statements about fashionable drinking and the attributes of the rich, saying, "these could have avoided by an intelligent director." He also criticised the slow pace of the film, saying, "as the film moves towards the climax comes the spoilsport device, a television show."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>

<p>Sify called it a box office super hit. It completed a theatrical run of more than 125 days in Kerala.
