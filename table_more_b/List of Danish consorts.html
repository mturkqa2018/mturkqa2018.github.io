This <b>list of Danish consorts</b> includes each queen consort (wife of a reigning king) and each prince consort (husband of a reigning queen). Due to unions (personal and real), the queens of 1380–1814 (effectively from 1406) were also queens of Norway, and the queens of 1389–1521 (effectively from 1406) were also (though with interruptions) queens of Sweden.

</td>
<td align="center" colspan="3"><small>Thyra may have been the daughter of one of the regional Danish chiefs, probably from southern Jutland. Claims that Thyra was a daughter of King Harald Klak have been discounted due to the impossibility of the ages of the persons involved. Thyra was the daughter of Aethelred, King of England according to the Gesta Danorum. Presumably Aethelred I, king of Wessex, is intended: if Aethelred II, king of England, then this is anachronistic.</small>
