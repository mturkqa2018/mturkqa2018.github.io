<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century:_Foundation_through_Hoofdklasse">20th century: Foundation through Hoofdklasse</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1_August_1929:_Foundation">1 August 1929: Foundation</span></h4>
<p>The club was founded on August 1, 1929, as ASW, by five youths from Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht: Bas van Wingerden (born 1915), Johannes van Wingerden (born 1917), Jan van Nieuwenhuyzen (born 1917), Siem van der Wulp (born 1919) and Harmen Haksteeg (born 1920). The oldest of the five, 14-year-old Bas van Wingerden, became the club's first chairman. He was succeeded by then 16-year-old Harmen Haksteeg in 1936. Haksteeg would remain chairman of the club until 1971.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The origin of the club name is not clear. Some claim it stood for <i>Altijd Sporten Wij</i> (We Always Play Sports), others claim it meant <i>Altijd Sterker Worden</i> (Always Grow Stronger). Clueless which of the two is correct, club members eventually settled on "Altijd Sterker Worden" because of a general preference for this phrase as is.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1930s:_The_first_decade">1930s: The first decade</span></h4>
<p>The club initially only played away matches, for lack of an own ground. This changed when a local farmer gave the club a pasture in 1936. The first home match was played on May 25, 1936, against ULO Groenendijk. The club joined the Rotterdam district of the Christian Dutch Football Association.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1940s:_The_war_and_re-emerging">1940s: The war and re-emerging</span></h4>
<p>In November 1941, ASW led the regional Division B competition unbeaten, beating among others Dordrecht 3–1. The season did not end in a championship. In 1942 the Nazis confiscated the field of ASW after which it played on Ido's Football Club grounds.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The last game during World War II was a 1–5 loss against Kinderdijk-side VV De Zwerver in February 1944. The first game after the war was a 3–0 loss against H.I.-Ambacht partner and rival IFC.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The first section title for ASW 1, in the highest division of the Dordrecht district of the Royal Dutch Football Association, was won in 1949, after winning all matches. This right for promotion posed a problem: the pitch didn't meet the criteria for admission to the main league system of the KNVB. A new ground on the Pruimendijk in Oostendam was offered by farmer Plaisier, and the club was promoted. An H for Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht was added to the club name, to avoid confusion with ASW from Dordrecht (merged in 1997 into SC Reeland).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1950s:_Vierde_Klasse_era">1950s: Vierde Klasse era</span></h4>
<p>During almost the entire 1950s ASWH played in the Vierde Klasse 4C and 4D. It ended 9th in 1954, 8th in 1955 and '56, 7th in 1950, 4th in 1953 and '58, 3rd in 1951 and '57, and runner-up in 1952. In 1959 it won the 4D section championship and promoted to the Derde Klasse.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1960s:_Derde_Klasse_era">1960s: Derde Klasse era</span></h4>
<p>The first gig in the Derde Klasse B lasted only one year and in Summer 1960 ASWH went back to the Vierde Klasse from position 9. For an equally short period as in 1961 ASWH secured its second Vierde Klasse section championship. In the decisive game, on Saturday 18 March 1961, it had beaten SV Bolnes 2–0 in Ambacht. ASWH thus promoted a second time to the Derde Klasse, this time staying for 2 seasons. In 1963 ASWH returned to the Vierde Klasse for two seasons.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 1965 it promoted from a second position Vierde Klasse, never to the Vierde again. Now a stable Derde Klasse team, it ended 8th in 1966, runner-up in 1967, 5th in 1968, and 6th in 1969.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1970s:_Tweede_Klasse_era">1970s: Tweede Klasse era</span></h4>
<p>Slowly but steadily, ASWH rose through the ranks. In 1970 the Ambacht-side won its only Derde Klasse championship, after it beat RC Leiderdorp 2–0 at home. It promoted to the Tweede Klasse where it would play for the remainder of the 1970s and beyond.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1980s:_Eerste_klasse_era">1980s: Eerste klasse era</span></h4>
<p>During most of the 1980s ASWH played in the Eerste Klasse.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="1990s:_Flextime">1990s: Flextime</span></h4>
<p>During the years 1992–1995 ASWH played back in the Tweede klasse. In 1995 it was back in the Eerste Klasse.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>In 1996 ASWH promoted from the Eerste Klasse to the Hoofdklasse, the highest tier of amateur football in the Netherlands. The club was relegated two years later, followed by the title in the Eerste Klasse and automatic promotion back to the Hoofdklasse.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="21st_century:_Hoofdklasse_then_Derde_Divisie">21st century: Hoofdklasse then Derde Divisie</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2000s:_Hoofdklasse_era">2000s: Hoofdklasse era</span></h4>
<p>The club was placed in the Saturday Hoofdklasse B, where it finished in third place. The next season brought the first Hoofdklasse title in the club's existence. In 2002 ASWH again won the title, this time in the Saturday Hoofdklasse A.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>A third Hoofdklasse championship was earned in 2004–05, this time followed by the national title for Saturday amateurs, defeating IJsselmeervogels and Excelsior '31, and the national amateur title, defeating Mijdrecht-side SV Argon.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2010s:_Derde_Divisie">2010s: Derde Divisie</span></h4>
<p>From Fall 2010 through Spring 2016 ASWH played continuously in Hoofdklasse B. In the 2015–2016 season ASWH finished third in the Hoofdklasse. Through playoffs it promoted for the first time beyond the Hoofdklasse, to the newly coined Derde Divisie (formerly the Topklasse).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In the 2016–17 KNVB Cup ASWH beat De Treffers 0–3 in Groesbeek in the first round. In the second round, it won 2-3 over SV Spakenburg playing in Spakenburg. In the third round it lost 2–0 against AZ Alkmaar in Alkmaar. While ASWH suffered a moderate loss and returned to Ambacht with dignified results against a leading professional team, AZ did not utilize several of its prime players. AZ were eventually runners-up in the National Cup.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>ASWH started its first Derde Divisie season with a series of victories, eventually stopped at a 1–3 defeat against Heemskerk-side ODIN '59. It was a sour loss as ASWH had not been beaten at Sportpark Schildman since November 2015 and controlled the ball 70% of the game. Regrouping soon enough, ASWH completed its first Derde Divisie season in 4th position.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In the 2017–18 KNVB Cup ASWH was out in its first game and second qualification round against Hoofdklasse-team HSV Hoek, when the Zeelanders beat ASWH 1–3 in Sportpark Schildman. ASWH 2 followed suit; it did not pass the classifying stage of the District Cup after it lost 3–1 against De Zwerver.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>The second Derde Divisie season of ASWH started rather weak with defeats against FC Groningen (0–1), Quick Boys (0–1), and FC Volendam (0–5), draws against SV Spakenburg (2–2), DSV Ermelo (0–0), Jong Twente (2–2), VVOG Harderwijk (1–1), and VV Spijkenisse (0–0), and victories against Magreb Utrecht (2–5) and in a regional derby against VV Capelle (0–1). On 18 November ASWH had a convincing home victory over ONS Sneek, 4–1.
