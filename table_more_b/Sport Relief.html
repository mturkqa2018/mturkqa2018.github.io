<p>Like Comic Relief, the television programming begins in the afternoon, with CBBC having various related reports and money raising events. This is all in-between the regular programmes, but after the six o'clock news, the usual BBC One schedule is suspended at 7pm in favour of a live telethon, with a break at 10pm for the regular news programme. However, whilst the <i>BBC News at Ten</i> is aired on BBC One, Sport Relief continues on BBC Two, and then resumes on BBC One at 10:35pm, with each hour overseen by a different celebrity team. These celebrities do the work for free, as do the crew, with studio space and production facilities donated by the BBC.
