<p>The castle of <i>Byhor</i>, or Bihar (now Biharia in Romania), was the center of the duchy of Menumorut at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the 890s, according to the <i>Gesta Hungarorum</i>. The <i>Gesta</i>â€”the only primary source which mentions Menumorutâ€”describes him as a ruler "with Bulgarian heart" who was the vassal of the Byzantine Emperor. Menumorut's subjects were Khazars, and the SzÃ©kelys joined the invading Hungarians in his duchy. Historian Tudor SÄƒlÄƒgean writes that other peoples (including Romanians) must have also lived in Menumorut's realm. Menumorut was forced to give his daughter in marriage to ZoltÃ¡n, son of ÃrpÃ¡d, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. When he died, his son-in-law inherited his duchy. Modern scholars debate whether Menumorut and his duchy actually existed or the anonymous author of the <i>Gesta</i> invented them. For instance, historian GyÃ¶rgy GyÃ¶rffy says that Menumorut's name preserved the memory of the Moravians who dominated parts of the Carpathian Basin in the <span class="nowrap">9th century</span>. According to historians GyÃ¶rgy GyÃ¶rffy and Victor Spinei, the presence of Kabars in the region could have given rise to Anonymous' reference to Menumorut's "Khazars".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Place names of Slavic originâ€”for instance, <i>Zomlyn</i> (near modern Darvas in Hungary),  CsatÃ¡r and Szalacs (now Cetariu and SÄƒlacea in Romania)â€”show that Slav communities lived along the rivers Ã‰r and BerettyÃ³ and around Bihar. Graves of 10th-century warriors, buried together with parts of their horses, have been excavated, for instance, at Bihar, HajdÃºbÃ¶szÃ¶rmÃ©ny, and Nagyszalonta (now Salonta in Romania). According to archaeologist Thomas NÃ¤gler, the small number of graves which can be attributed to 10th-century Hungarian warriors shows that few Hungarians settled in the region after the Hungarian conquest. Archaeologist Erwin GÃ¡ll writes that the cemetery at Bihar may represent a "peripheral centre" of a core region which was located along the upper courses of the river Tisza, because the burial customs were similar in the two territories. Almost a dozen medieval villagesâ€”for instance, FelkÃ©r, KÃ¶rÃ¶skisjenÅ‘ and KÃ¶rÃ¶starjÃ¡n  (now Felcheriu, Ineu and TÄƒrian in Romania)â€”bore the name of a Hungarian tribe, suggesting that Hungarian groups settled in the region in the late 10th and early <span class="nowrap">11th centuries</span>, according to GyÃ¶rgy GyÃ¶rffy.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Written sources and toponyms implies the presence of SzÃ©kelys. The castle folk of <i>Ebey</i>â€”a village, located near Nagyszalonta, which was later abandonedâ€”were grouped into a "hundred", or <i>centurionatus</i>, named SzÃ©kelyszÃ¡z around 1217. The Seat of Telegd was most probably named after the village Telegd (now Tileagd in Romania). If this scholarly theory is valid, the ancestors of the SzÃ©kelys of Telegd had lived in Bihar County before they moved to eastern Transylvania. Historian Florin Curta writes that the SzÃ©kelys settled in the county only in the early <span class="nowrap">13th century</span>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Modern historians agree that the county was established between 1020 and 1050, most probably by Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, or possibly by his successor, Peter. According to a version of a royal charter, issued in 1203, mentioned that "the whole Bihar County" was located partly around Bihar and partly around ZarÃ¡nd (now ZÄƒrand in Romania), suggesting that Bihar County had originally included ZarÃ¡nd County, or at least its territories north of the river FehÃ©r-KÃ¶rÃ¶s. An other version of the same charter also mentioned BÃ©kÃ©s besides Bihar and ZarÃ¡nd, implying that Bihar County had also included the lands which developed into the separate BÃ©kÃ©s County.

<p>The 11th-century Bihar Castle, made of earth and timber, was the first center of the county. The earliest royal charter that mentioned the <i>ispÃ¡n</i>, or head, of the county was issued around 1067. The county was included in the <i>ducatus</i>, or duchy, that Andrew I of Hungary granted to his younger brother, BÃ©la, around 1050. BÃ©la's son, GÃ©za, ruled the duchy from 1064. Nomadic Turksâ€”Pechenegs or Ouzesâ€”plundered the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the region around Bihar Castle in 1068. Duke GÃ©za, his brother, Ladislaus, and their cousin, King Solomon of Hungary, joined their forces and chased the marauders as far as Doboka (now DÄƒbÃ¢ca in Romania). Six years later, "the troops from <i>Byhor</i>" were under the command of Duke Ladislaus in the Battle of MogyorÃ³d which ended with the decisive victory of GÃ©za and Ladislaus over King Solomon. The first document that mentioned the county was issued in 1075.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>According to GyÃ¶rgy GyÃ¶rffy, the county seems to have originally been included in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger, because the Deanery of Zsomboly, located to the south of Bihar County, formed an exclave of the Eger bishopric during the Middle Ages. The separate Roman Catholic Diocese of Bihar was set up between 1020 and 1061. Its see was transferred to VÃ¡rad (now Oradea in Romania) before 1095. There were four deaneries in the county; the Deanery of Bihar was the first to have been documented (in 1213). Pilgrims frequented the shrine of King St Ladislaus in the VÃ¡rad Cathedral after his canonization in 1192 and trials by ordeal were also held there.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Emeric, King of Hungary approached Pope Innocent III, asking him to make "Latins" abbot of the Greek monasteries in the Kingdom of Hungary to restore discipline. In a letter, written on 16 May 1204, the pope ordered the Catholic Bishop of VÃ¡rad to visit the "Greek" monasteries and to set up a separate diocese, directly subjected to the Holy See, for them. According to historian Ioan-Aurel Pop, those "Greek" monasteries actually belonged to the local Orthodox Romanians'. Pop also writes that the Orthodox bishopric "in the country of Knez Bela", mentioned in a letter that Pope Innocent wrote to the Archbishop of Kalocsa in 1205, was located north of Oradea.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>At least 19 villagesâ€”including KÃ¶rÃ¶skisjenÅ‘, MezÅ‘gyÃ¡n and MezÅ‘sas in Bihar County, and GyulavarsÃ¡nd and VadÃ¡sz (now VÄƒrÈ™and and VÃ¢nÄƒtori) in ZarÃ¡nd Countyâ€”made up the honour of Bihar Castle in the early <span class="nowrap">13th century</span>. The <i>VÃ¡rad Register</i>â€”a codex which preserved the minutes of hundreds of ordeals held at the VÃ¡rad Chapter between 1208 and 1235â€”provides information of the life of the commoners in the honour. The castle folk who were divided in "hundreds" provided well-specified services to the <i>ispÃ¡n</i>. The <i>Register</i> mentioned the gatekeepers and the hunters of Bihar Castle. The <i>Register</i> also referred to "guest settlers" of foreignâ€”Rus', German or "Latin"â€”origin. For instance, Walloon "guests" established Olaszi near VÃ¡rad (now Olasig neighborhood in Oradea) before 1215.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The kings started to give away parcels of the royal domain already in the <span class="nowrap">11th century</span>. Prelates and ecclesiastic institutionsâ€”including the bishops of VÃ¡rad, the DÃ¶mÃ¶s Chapter and the Garamszentbenedek Abbeyâ€”were the first beneficiaries. According to GyÃ¶rgy GyÃ¶rffy, the noble Ãkos, Borsa, Gutkeled and Hont-PÃ¡zmÃ¡ny clans received their first estates in the county in the <span class="nowrap">11th century</span>; the Geregyes, the Telegdis and most other lords only in the late <span class="nowrap">13th century</span>. The western and southwestern lowlands were distributed among dozens of noble families, each holding only one village.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The Mongols captured and destroyed VÃ¡rad during their invasion of Hungary in 1241, according to Roger of Torre Maggiore, who was archdeacon of the VÃ¡rad Chapter at that time. At least 18% of the nearly 170 settlements documented in the county before 1241 disappeared during the Mongol invasion. Stephen V of Hungary exempted the peasants living in the estates of the bishop of VÃ¡rad of royal taxation and granted the bishop the right to open mines in his estates in 1263 to promote the economic recovery of the bishopric. A silver mine was in short opened at the bishop's domains at BelÃ©nyes (now BeiuÈ™ in Romania).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>New fortresses were built during the decades following the withdrawal of the Mongols. Judge royal Paul Geregye erected SÃ³lyomkÅ‘ Castle at Ã‰lesd (now AleÈ™d in Romania); his sons held further 2 newly built fortresses in the 1270s. Their power was crushed during King Ladislaus the Cuman's reign; he granted their fortresses and domains to the Borsas. James Borsa, one of the semi-independent "oligarchs", was the actual ruler of Bihar, Kraszna, Szabolcs, SzatmÃ¡r and Szolnok counties in the early <span class="nowrap">14th century</span>. After James Borsa's fall in the late 1310s, the noble Czibak, Debreceni and Telegdi families became the wealthiest lay landowners in the county. The center of the Debrecenis' ancestral estates, Debrecen, developed into a market town.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>One of the earliest references to the presence of Romanians in the countyâ€”the place name <i>Olahteluk</i> ("Vlachs' Plot")â€”was recorded in a non-authentic charter, dated to 1283. The first authentic document mentioning Romanians was issued in 1293. They lived in the region of the bishop's castle at VÃ¡rasfenes (now FiniÈ™ in Romania). Next a charter of 1326 referred to the Romanian Voivode Neagul who "settled and lived" <i>(considet and commoratur)</i> in Nicholas Telegdi's estate at KÃ¡ptalanhodos (now HodiÅŸ in Romania). Historian Ioan Aurel Pop writes that the latter charter proves that Nicholas Telegdi's estate had originally owned by Voivode Neagul.

<p>It was ruled by Ottoman Empire as Varat Eyalet between 1660â€“1692.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In 1876 the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into seven Circles, with a total of 64 counties The Circle on the left bank of the Theiss contained eight counties, including Bihar Megye (<i>Megye</i> means county), with the other seven being BÃ©kÃ©s, HajdÃº, MÃ¡ramaros, Szabolcs, SzatmÃ¡r, SzilÃ¡gy and Ugocsa.

<p>After World War II, the Hungarian county Bihar was merged with HajdÃº County to form HajdÃº-Bihar county. The southernmost part of Hungarian Bihar (the area around Sarkad and OkÃ¡ny) went to BÃ©kÃ©s County.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>The Romanian part of former Bihar County now forms the Romanian Bihor County, except the southernmost part (around Beliu), which is in Arad County.
