<p><i><b>The Closer</b></i> is an American television police procedural, starring Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda Leigh Johnson, a Los Angeles Police Department deputy chief. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and CIA-trained, Brenda has a reputation as a closer—an interrogator who not only solves a case, but also obtains confessions that lead to convictions, thus "closing" the case. Deputy Chief Johnson sometimes uses deceit and intimidation to persuade a suspect to confess. The series ran on TNT from June 13, 2005, to August 13, 2012.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p><i>The Closer</i> was created by James Duff and the Shephard/Robin Company in association with Warner Bros. Television.

<p>Each episode of <i>The Closer</i> deals with an aspect of the Los Angeles culture as it interfaces with law enforcement in the megacity.  The show deals with complex and subtle issues of public policy, ethics, personal integrity, and questions of good and evil.  The rather large character ensemble explores the human condition, touching on individual faiths, traditional religious influences in the lives and communities of contemporary society, and the breakdown and dysfunction of family systems, work teaming, and government responsibility. The first season began with Brenda Leigh Johnson arriving at the LAPD to lead the Priority Murder Squad (PMS), quickly renamed Priority Homicide Division (PHD), a team that originally dealt solely with high-profile murder cases (seasons one to four).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>During season four, an embarrassing tangle with the press, over just what were the criteria making a homicide a priority, allowed Brenda to manipulate circumstances so that the division was reorganized into a much larger major crimes division with a wider scope, though the majority of plots still involved and focused on homicides. Most importantly to the show's plot lines, Commander Taylor's role was also changed from "rival and in-house adversary" to that of "unambiguously loyal subordinate", so he was thereafter reporting directly to Deputy Chief Johnson and noticeably helpful as he coordinates interaction between the MCD and other units.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Season five introduced Mary McDonnell as Captain Sharon Raydor of the Force Investigations Division. Raydor and Johnson start out as rivals, but gradually they develop grudging respect for each other and form an uneasy alliance. McDonnell as Raydor went on to star in <i>The Closer</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s spin-off, <i>Major Crimes</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>During the final season, Brenda finds herself in civil legal difficulties as a result of the events in "War Zone" (season six, episode eight), and the LAPD concludes that a disloyal subordinate must be generating information leaks from within MCD. Taylor and Raydor take an active role in attempting to combat the leaker, and the legal matters do not reach a final resolution until the series' end, in the episode "The Last Word".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>On December 10, 2010, TNT announced that the seventh season of <i>The Closer</i>, which began production in the spring of 2011, would be the last. The channel said that the decision to retire the show was made by Kyra Sedgwick. On January 30, 2011, the media announced that the final season would add six episodes to the usual 15-episode order, building toward the spin-off series, <i>Major Crimes</i>.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: List of The Closer characters</div>
<p>The cast consists largely of an ensemble of detectives who make up the LAPD's fictional Major Crimes Division. It is led by Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, played by Kyra Sedgwick.  Some observers have noted strong similarities between Johnson and Jane Tennison, Helen Mirren's lead character in the British crime drama, <i>Prime Suspect</i>, with an article in <i>USA Today</i> claiming <i>The Closer</i> to be "an unofficial Americanization" of the British drama.  In interviews, Sedgwick has acknowledged that the show owes "a debt" to <i>Prime Suspect</i> and her admiration for that show and Mirren were factors that first interested her in the role.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Other main characters include Johnson's superior officer, Assistant Chief Will Pope (J. K. Simmons), Robbery-Homicide Division Commander Russell Taylor (Robert Gossett), and her FBI agent boyfriend-then-husband Fritz Howard (Jon Tenney).  The remainder of the cast makes up Brenda's squad, each with expertise in a specific area, such as crime-scene investigation or gang activity.  The first and only departure from the regular cast occurred in season five, when actress Gina Ravera left and her character, Detective Irene Daniels, was transferred to another division.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Mary McDonnell, a recurring cast member in seasons five and six, joined the cast full-time for season seven, continuing her role as Captain Sharon Raydor.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_impact">Cultural impact</span></h2>
<p>Both gender researchers and members of the media have claimed that the series has "expanded the vocabulary of what is acceptable for women as seen through the lens of popular culture."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<blockquote><p>"We've certainly seen women in powerful positions before," says author and gender researcher Maddy Dychtwald, pointing out Angie Dickinson in 1974's <i>Police Woman</i>, and <i>Cagney &amp; Lacey</i> from 1981. "But those women were largely token in a sea of dominant males, and most important, strove to be like the men that surrounded them." In contrast, Dychtwald says the former CIA interrogator played by Kyra Sedgwick, "retains (and revels in) her femininity, keeps her composure, can handle the two 'sexist pigs' who bait her due to their jealousy and insecurities, and not lose her head."<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Media experts have also noted that the series has helped to redefine the place of basic cable channels alongside network programming:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Beyond gently tweaking the popular image of women in power, "The Closer" has helped redefine the power balance between basic cable and broadcast networks, says Fordham University media expert Paul Levinson. Just glance at the equal number of recent Emmy nominations for basic and premium cable shows is confirmation, he adds. Beyond that, says <i>More Magazine</i> Entertainment Director Kathy Heintzelman, the off-season placement—the show launched in the summer and continues to air its seasons in counterbalance to the traditional network schedule—has helped redefine viewing habits. "It's helped people get used to the idea that summer is a time to watch original series on televisions," she adds.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="U.S._television_ratings">U.S. television ratings</span></h2>
<p>The debut of <i>The Closer</i> was seen by more than 7 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research and was the top-rated premiere episode ever of any original scripted series on basic cable. The second- (8.28) and third-season (8.81) premieres broke the previous record. Viewer numbers (based on average total viewers per episode) of <i>The Closer</i> on TNT:

<li id="cite_note-MCD-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink">^  </span> <span class="reference-text">Previously known as Priority Murder Squad (season one, episodes one and two), then Priority Homicide Division (season one, episode three through season four, episode nine). The division's name was first changed from Priority Murder Squad when it was recognized that the initials were PMS, leading to unintended humor due to Chief Johnson's sex. The division's official name was changed to Major Crimes Division (MCD) during season four, episode nine in response to the storyline's media misinterpretation of the use of the word "Priority", and the team first operated as the MCD in the following episode.

At the end of summer season four, episode nine ("Tijuana Brass"), the squad was given the task to handle a range of crimes, including fraud and kidnapping, and renamed the Major Crimes Division, whose brief was enlarged (in theory) to include to a wider range of major crimes including grand theft, fraud, rape, and homicide, along the lines of a major Case squad. Nevertheless, storylines continued to focus on solving murders until late in the sixth season, when after the ascension of a new police chief, the underused squad was assigned a serial armed robbery gang—which in the event, quickly became a murder investigation the next day.</span>
