<p>He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004.  He won a crowded Republican primary in the newly created 10th District.  The district was thought to be so heavily Republican that no Democratic candidate even filed, effectively handing the seat to McCaul.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 2006 he defeated Democratic candidate Ted Ankrum and former Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik with 55% of the vote. McCaul won re-election once again in 2008, against Democratic candidate Larry Joe Doherty and Libertarian candidate Matt Finkel by a 54 to 43 percent margin.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 2010, he was re-elected to a fourth term with 76% of the vote against Democratic candidate Ted Ankrum (22%) and Libertarian candidate Jeremiah "JP" Perkins (1 percent).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>McCaul won a seventh term in the House in the general election held on November 8, 2016.

<p>In August 2011 AlterNet reported that McCaul, along with John Culberson and Ted Poe, was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier's funeral. The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three stated their demands were a response to Veterans Affairs (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals; however, VA state this claim is "blatantly false" as VA respects families' "rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In September 2013, McCaul said that he would trust Russia rather than the United States to account for Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. He did say that the monitoring and destruction of the chemical weapons in Syria would have to be overseen by an international commission of the United Nations, emphasizing that Putin and Russia have superior leverage over Syria to better accomplish the removal of WMD from the Syrian arsenal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>On November 30, 2016 McCaul appeared on Fox News with Bret Baier to discuss his possible nomination to head the Department of Homeland Security by president-elect Donald Trump.  McCaul's interview was marred with controversy when Baier cited a <i>Washington Times</i> article quoting William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC which said "We certainly hope that Donald Trump would not reward a deceptive pro-amnesty lawmaker like Michael McCaul with a Cabinet position," said William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. "That would be very disappointing to all of us that believed his campaign promises to secure our borders and deport millions of illegal immigrants under current U.S. laws."

<p>On December 11, 2013, McCaul introduced the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 3696; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct cybersecurity activities on behalf of the federal government and would codify the role of DHS in preventing and responding to cybersecurity incidents involving the Information Technology (IT) systems of federal civilian agencies and critical infrastructure in the United States. McCaul said that the bill was "an important step toward addressing the cyber threat." According to McCaul, the bill "establishes a true partnership between DHS and the private sector to ensure the distribution of real-time cyber threat information in order to secure our nation in cyberspace without burdensome mandates or regulations."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In a December 2, 2016 Fox News op-ed, McCaul declared his intention to support legislation, in line with president-elect Donald Trump's proposals, to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border, to secure the border, and have Mexico and other Latin American countries pay for these proposals.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In April 2019, McCaul spoke out against a resolution that would end US involvement in the Yemeni Civil War. Recognizing the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, McCaul explained his belief that approving the resolution would "disrupt US security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries."

The selection follows McCaul’s recent publication of "A National Strategy to Win the War Against Islamist Terror", a compilation of more than 100 counterterrorism strategies and recommendations. McCaul says his approach to counterterrorism will aid in integrating the nation’s homeland security policies into the digital age through the implementation of detailed screening of foreign visitors, including immigrants and refugees, by utilizing the latest technologies and intelligence.

<p>McCaul is married to Linda Mays McCaul. She is the daughter of Clear Channel Communications chairman Lowry Mays and sister of its CEO Mark Mays. In 2011, Roll Call named McCaul as one of the wealthiest members of the United States Congress, surpassing then U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-MA). His net worth was estimated at $294 million, which is approximately 300% higher than it was in the previous year ($74 million). In 2004, Roll Call estimated his net worth at just $12 million. His wealth increase was due to large monetary transfers from his wife's family. The McCauls live in West Lake Hills, Texas, a wealthy suburb of Austin, Texas, with their children, daughters Caroline, Jewell, Avery, and Lauren, and a son, Michael..  McCaul is frequently in the top ten users of household water in the Austin area, and was the #1 consumer of household water in Austin for 2017.
