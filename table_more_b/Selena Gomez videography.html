<p>American singer and actress Selena Gomez has appeared in music videos, films, and television shows. From her debut album with her former band Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene, <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i> (2009), she released music videos for the singles "Falling Down" and "Naturally". The band's second album, <i>A Year Without Rain</i> (2010), released the music video for "Round &amp; Round" and for the "eponymous single". The band's third album, <i>When the Sun Goes Down</i> (2011), released the music video for "Who Says", "Love You like a Love Song", which was nominated for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and "Hit the Lights". Early 2012, Gomez announced the band would take a hiatus while Gomez focused on her acting career. In 2013, she confirmed that she would be releasing her solo debut album, as opposed to another album with her band.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Gomez's first solo album <i>Stars Dance</i> (2013) released the music video for "Come &amp; Get It", which won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, and "Slow Down". Having spent seven years with Hollywood Records, Gomez signed a recording contract with Interscope Records in 2014. To officially end her contract with Hollywood Records, Gomez released the compilation album <i>For You</i> (2014) and released music videos for the single "The Heart Wants What It Wants". Gomez's second studio album <i>Revival</i> (2015) produced the music videos for "Good for You"  and "Same Old Love", in 2015, "Hands to Myself" and "Kill Em with Kindness", in 2016.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Gomez made her television debut in the children's television series <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i>. From 2007 to 2012, Gomez starred in the Disney Channel television series <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i> as Alex Russo. Gomez's acting credits include starring roles in the films <i>Another Cinderella Story</i> (2008), <i>Princess Protection Program</i> (2009), <i>Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie</i> (2009), <i>Ramona and Beezus</i> (2010), <i>Monte Carlo</i> (2011), <i>Spring Breakers</i> (2012), <i>Getaway</i> (2013) and <i>The Fundamentals of Caring</i> (2016). She voices the character of Mavis in the <i>Hotel Transylvania</i> film franchise. In 2018, her cumulative box office is around $2.5 billion.
