<p>The National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) in the U.S. state of Missouri represent Missouri's history from the Lewis and Clark Expedition, through the American Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Space Age. There are 37 National Historic Landmarks in Missouri. One site in Missouri was once a National Historic Landmark but later had its designation withdrawn when it failed to meet the program's criteria for inclusion. The NHLs are distributed across fifteen of Missouri's 114 counties and one independent city, with a concentration of fifteen landmarks in the state's only independent city, St. Louis.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The National Park Service (NPS), a branch of the U.S. Department of the Interior, administers the National Historic Landmark program. The NPS is responsible for determining which sites meet the criteria for designation or withdrawal as an NHL as well as identifying potential candidates for the program, through theme studies. The NPS and the National Park System Advisory Board then meet to determine the historical significance of these candidates. The final decision regarding a site's designation as a National Historic Landmark is made by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. However, the owner of a property may object to the designation of that property as an NHL. In such cases, the site is only "eligible for designation." A property eligible for NHL status is also eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Designated National Historic Landmarks are listed on the NRHP, which includes historic properties that the National Park Service has determined to be worthy of preservation. While NHL areas are deemed to carry national historic significance, other NRHP properties may only be significant at local or state levels.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Five historic sites in Missouri are in the U.S. National Park system. These are automatically listed in the NRHP and include one U.S. National Monument, one National Memorial, one National Battlefield, and two National Historic Sites.

<td class="note">The buildings in Anheuser-Busch's brewing district date from the late 1800s and are made of brick. Many are decorated with gargoyles and other such figures on the exterior. In addition, the company has also added new buildings and renovated older ones, but the district's status as a historic site has not been compromised.

<td class="note">The crossing of the Missouri River at Arrow Rock, which was recorded in the 1700s, played an important role in early explorations, such as the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1804, that led to the opening of the American West. A ferry was later established near Arrow Rock, at what became a starting point for traders on the Santa Fe Trail. The district is now home to Arrow Rock State Park.

<td class="note">This building of this memorial started with a group of about 40 citizens, a Memorial Association led by Robert A. Long, and a dedication to build a memorial to the fallen soldiers of WW I. With funding secured (a massive fund raising that brought in over 2.5 million dollars) and approval from the city council, construction began on November 1, 1921. The Groundbreaking ceremony was the first and last gathering a group of men that included: Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium, Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France, General Armando Diaz of Italy, Admiral Earl Beatty of Great Britain, and General John Pershing of the United States. The dedication, on November 11, 1926, was attended by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. The Liberty Memorial is home to The National World War I Museum

<p>National Historical Parks, some National Historic Sites, some National Monuments, and certain other areas in the National Park system are highly protected historic landmarks of national importance, often listed before the inauguration of the NHL program in 1960 and not later named NHLs. There are five of these areas in Missouri. However, these five are listed by the National Park Service together with the other NHLs in Missouri.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Former_National_Historic_Landmarks">Former National Historic Landmarks</span></h2>
<p>If an area currently designated as a National Historic Landmark is no longer eligible under the criteria for inclusion, its designation may be withdrawn. This usually occurs when the property undergoes any change that reduces or eliminates its national significance, usually demolition, addition, or other alterations. NHL status can be considered for withdrawal at the request of a property's owner or by the Secretary of the Interior. However, a former NHL can still remain on the National Register of Historic Places if it meets the necessary criteria for that listing. As of January 2009, only 28 sites are former (delisted) NHLs.

It stayed in St. Louis from 1937 to 1990, when it was purchased by the city of St. Charles, Missouri. In 2003, the city gave the showboat to a local businessperson, who moored it in Calhoun County, Illinois; in 2008, he transferred ownership of the boat to a St. Louis entrepreneur, who has stored it at another dock in the same county since then. While this means the Goldenrod Showboat is not currently a National Historic Landmark <i>in Missouri</i>, the National Park Service continues to list the ship as a Missouri landmark.</span>
