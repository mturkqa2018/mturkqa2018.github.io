It was serialized in <i>Weekly ShÅnen Jump</i> from 1992 to 1995, with the 174 chapters collected into eighteen <i>tankÅbon</i> volumes. In its original publication, it was titled <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: JÅsuke Higashikata</i>. It was preceded by <i>Stardust Crusaders</i> and followed by <i>Golden Wind</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Araki introduced the Bow and Arrow in this arc, which causes characters pierced by it to develop a Stand ability. This was used on DIO at the beginning of Part 3, which not only gave him a Stand but caused Stands to develop in the Joestar bloodline as well. The arc was adapted into an anime television series by David Production, <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable</i>, that began in April 2016.  A live-action film adaptation by Toho and Warner Bros. titled <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I</i> was released on August 4, 2017. Viz Media has licensed the manga and will proceed to release it in English on May 7, 2019 in a compiled format.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>In 1999, in the town of Morioh located in S-City, M-Prefecture, a freshman named Koichi Hirose meets a man looking for Josuke Higashikata, a popular boy in high school. Josuke, who is the illegitimate child of Joseph Joestar, soon meets the man, who introduces himself as Jotaro Kujo. Jotaro's arrival in Morioh pulls Josuke into the world of the supernatural powers known as <i>Stands</i>, as he becomes involved in Jotaro's search for the Stand-creating Bow and Arrow. Josuke and Koichi eventually come across a pair of Stand-using brothers, Okuyasu and Keicho Nijimura. Keicho is revealed to be the one possessing the Bow.  Koichi is shot by the Arrow, but survives and gains a Stand of his own. After he and his brother are defeated, Keicho is attacked by the Stand Red Hot Chili Pepper, which kills him and takes the Bow and Arrow. Okuyasu joins with Josuke, Jotaro, and Koichi to fight the Stand that killed his brother, and eventually becomes close friends with Josuke. The group encounter several other Stand users before eventually coming face-to-face with Akira Otoishi, Red Hot Chili Pepper's user. The Bow and Arrow are taken into Jotaro's custody and all seems to be over for the moment. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Soon afterward, Koichi and the manga artist Rohan Kishibe discover a mysterious alleyway and meet the ghost of a young girl named Reimi Sugimoto. Reimi, who was murdered by a serial killer over a decade ago, begs Koichi and Rohan to find her killer, who is still lurking within Morioh. When Josuke and Okuyasu's new friend, Shigekiyo "Shigechi" Yangu, discovers the killer Reimi spoke of, he is murdered before he can tell anyone.  However, Shigechi is able to leave a small clue behind which allows the group to track down the killer, a man named Yoshikage Kira. Jotaro and Koichi eventually fight Kira, who flees before being defeated and forces another Stand user to alter his appearance and give him the face of a man named Kosaku Kawajiri; Kira kills both to cover his tracks. Shortly thereafter, the group discovers the ghost of Kira's father, who uses a second Bow and Arrow to create an army of Stand users to protect his son. Kira's true identity is eventually discovered by Kawajiri's son, Hayato. Hayato is killed, and Kira is granted a new ability by his father's Arrow. That same day, Rohan begins to suspect Kosaku Kawajiri as Kira's new identity and confirms this after reading Hayato's memories. However, Rohan is immediately killed by Killer Queen's new power, Bites the Dust, which can kill anyone who asks Hayato for Kira's identity and rewind time by one hour afterward, while preserving the victim's fate.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>After Hayato witnesses Rohan's death once more, Josuke, Koichi, Okuyasu, and Jotaro arrive to meet him. They see Hayato and figure out that Kira is masquerading as his father, which causes Bites the Dust to kill all of them. The day loops again, but Hayato manages to trick Kira into giving his own identity away, alerting Josuke. Kira is forced to remove Bites the Dust from Hayato to protect himself as he fights Josuke, saving Rohan and the rest of the group from their fate. With help from Josuke, Hayato, Okuyasu, and Koichi, Jotaro delivers a blow to Kira that propels him in front of an ambulance, killing him. During a confrontation with Reimi, Kira's ghost is dragged off to the underworld. With Kira dead and the murders ended, Reimi says her last goodbyes to the Stand users of Morioh as she ascends to heaven. Hayato returns to his mother, who remains unaware of Kawajiri's death. As Jotaro and Joseph prepare to leave Morioh, Josuke wishes them the best, but not before pranking Joseph by stealing his wallet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characters">Characters</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters Â§Â Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable</div>
<ul><li><b>Josuke Higashikata</b> is the main protagonist and illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar. He is a freshman who lives in the town of Morioh with his mother and grandfather. He uses the Stand Crazy Diamond, which can not only punch rapidly, but also restore objects to their original state or rearrange their structure, allowing him to heal injuries, erase written documents, or revert complex structures to their raw components. He becomes especially enraged if anyone ever makes fun of his pompadour hairstyle.</li>
<li><b>Koichi Hirose</b> is a freshman and classmate of Josuke's who meets him by running into his nephew Jotaro, resulting in the two becoming friends. Koichi is also a freshman in high school, but appears as a short boy. His Stand is Echoes, which has three distinct "Acts". Acts 1 and 2 can replicate sound effects and attach them to anything, which result in that happening to the object (e.g. attaching the word "whoosh" causes a gust of wind to blow by) while Act 3 loses the former abilities and gains the ability "Freeze" which causes a target to become very heavy.</li>
<li><b>Okuyasu Nijimura</b> is one of the two Nijimura brothers who became friends with Josuke and Koichi after defeating a Stand user who murdered his brother. His Stand The Hand, swipes with its right hand which erases whatever it swipes and it can be used to erase space, drawing objects closer to Okuyasu.</li>
<li><b>Jotaro Kujo</b> is the protagonist of the previous story arc, <i>Stardust Crusaders</i>, who travels to Morioh to find his grandfather's illegitimate son, technically Josuke's nephew despite being older than him, as well as investigate the crimes of a Stand user. His Stand Star Platinum can stop the flow of time for everyone but Jotaro and his stand for a split-second at the start, and then 1-2 seconds in the later half of the part.</li>
<li><b>Joseph Joestar</b> is Josuke's father and Jotaro's grandfather. He is the protagonist of <i>Battle Tendency</i> and one of the main characters of <i>Stardust Crusaders</i>. He uses the Stand Hermit Purple, which manifests in form of thorny purple vines that allow to divine information, typically through electrical equipment such as Polaroid cameras. They can also be utilised as ropes.</li>
<li><b>Rohan Kishibe</b> is a famous manga artist who recently moved into a house in Morioh. His Stand Heaven's Door, allows him to temporarily turn a person into a book, with all of their memories written down akin to a novel. Rohan can read the memories, learn their weaknesses and secrets, as well as write down commands that they must follow (usually, "Can not attack Rohan Kishibe.") The power only activates when the target sees Rohan's drawn artwork, but can also activate if Rohan draws something in the air with his finger. Rohan also stars in his own spin-off one-shot series by Araki called <i>Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan</i>.</li>
<li><b>Keicho Nijimura</b>  is Okuyasu's big brother who caused the outbreak of Stand users in Morioh to create one whose Stand can end the suffering of their father after he was mutated by Dio Brando into a monstrous, addled immortal. Keicho was later killed by Akira Otoishi when saving his brother from an attack by the guitarist's stand. Keicho's Stand Bad Company  is an army of toy soldiers.</li>
<li><b>Anjuro Katagiri</b>, also known as "Angelo"  is a depraved serial killer with an IQ of 160. While on death row for murdering a rich person while staging a post-mortem ransom, Angelo is made a Stand User by Keicho and uses his water-based Stand Aqua Necklace  to escape and resume his killing spree in Morioh before ultimately confronting Josuke, murdering the youth's grandfather before being fused by Crazy Diamond's powers into a stone that becomes Morioh's tourist attraction Angel Rock .</li>
<li><b>Yoshikage Kira</b> is the main antagonist and a mild-mannered serial killer who has been murdering women for over 15 years. His Stand, Killer Queen, has the ability to completely disintegrate his victims by explosion, leaving no evidence behind.</li>
<li><b>Reimi Sugimoto</b> is Yoshikage Kira's first victim. She was killed 15 years before the happenings of the manga and waited as a ghost for someone whom she could warn about her killer.</li></ul>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">See also: Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I</div>
<p>In 2000, it was announced that Otsuichi would be writing a novel based on Part 4. The novel proved difficult to complete; in <i>Kono Mystery ga Sugoi</i> 2004, Otsuichi claimed to have written over 2000 pages, but thrown them all out. Intent on writing a novel that lived up to the manga, it took him until 2007 before <i>The Book: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 4th Another Day</i> was finally released on November 26. It is set after the events in the manga, and includes illustrations by Araki.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1997, Araki published the <i>Weekly ShÅnen Jump</i> one-shot <i>Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe ~Episode 16.. Confessional~</i>, starring Rohan after the events of Part 4. In 1999 he wrote the three-chapter story <i>Dead Man's Questions</i> in <i>Allman</i> magazine. <i>Dead Man's Questions</i> stars Yoshikage Kira, the main antagonist of Part 4. Both <i>Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe</i> and <i>Dead Man's Questions</i> were later compiled in Araki's one-shot collection, <i>Under Jailbreak, Under Execution</i>, in 1999. The former launched a series starring Rohan, <i>Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The December 11, 2007 issue of <i>Jump Square</i> featured a second entry into the <i>Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe</i> collection, entitled <i>Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe ~Mutsukabezaka~</i>, set seven years after the events of Part IV. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In 2009, Araki wrote the full-color story <i>Rohan au Louvre</i>. The short story was displayed at the MusÃ©e du Louvre as part of their 2009 <i>Le Louvre invite la bande dessinÃ©e</i> exhibit. The story was later republished in <i>Ultra Jump</i> in 2010. In 2012, <i>Rohan au Louvre</i> was released in English by NBM Publishing under the translated title <i>Rohan at the Louvre</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In 2011, Araki collaborated with the renowned Italian fashion brand Gucci for the short story <i>Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci</i> in the women's fashion magazine <i>Spur</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 2012, Araki wrote a third <i>Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe</i> one-shot for <i>Weekly ShÅnen Jump</i>. Entitled <i>Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe ~Episode 5: Millionaire Village~</i> it was released in the October 6, 2012 issue of the magazine.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In October 2015, Warner Bros. announced that Part 4 would receive an anime television adaptation that serves as a continuation of David Production's ongoing anime television of the entire series. The series began airing in April 2016.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Toho and Warner Bros. partnered to produce a live-action film based on the fourth arc of <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</i> that was released on August 4, 2017. Takashi Miike directed the film that stars Kento Yamazaki as Josuke. Both studios planned for worldwide distribution and, with a title of <i>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I</i>, are hoping to create sequels.
