<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Peter was born in the defensive tower of the Monasterio de Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas in Burgos, Spain. His parents were Alfonso XI of Castile and Maria of Portugal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>According to chancellor and chronicler Pero L√≥pez de Ayala, he had a pale complexion, blue eyes and very light blonde hair; he was tall (1.83 m) and muscular.  He was accustomed to long, strenuous hours of work, lisped a little and "loved women greatly".  He was well read and a patron of the arts, and in his formative years he enjoyed entertainment, music and poetry.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Peter began his reign when almost sixteen years old and subjected to the control of his mother and her favourites. He was to be married to Joan, daughter of Edward III of England; on their way to Castile, however, her retinue travelled through cities infested with the Black Death, ignoring townspeople who had warned them not to enter their settlements. Since the plague had not yet entered England, it is likely that they understandably underestimated the danger. Joan, fourteen years old and Edward's favorite, by his own admission, soon contracted the disease and died.

<p>Though at first controlled by his mother, Peter emancipated himself with the encouragement of the minister Alburquerque.  Becoming attached to Mar√≠a de Padilla, he married her in secret in 1353.  Mar√≠a turned him against Alburquerque, who fled to Portugal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In the summer of 1353, the young king was practically coerced by his mother and the nobles into marrying Blanche of Bourbon; he deserted her at once.  This marriage necessitated Peter's denying that he had married Mar√≠a, but his relationship with her continued and she bore him four children.  He also apparently went through the form of marriage with Juana de Castro, widow of Don Diego de Haro, convincing her that his previous marriage to Queen Blanche was a nullity. The bishops of Avila and Salamanca were asked to concur, and were afraid to say otherwise. Peter and Juana were married in Cuellar, and Juana was proclaimed Queen of Castile.  After two nights he then deserted her. (She bore him a son who died young, after Peter's death.) A period of turmoil followed in which the king was for a time overpowered and in effect imprisoned.  The dissension within the party striving to coerce him enabled him to escape from Toro, where he was under observation, to Segovia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1361, Queen Blanche died at Medina Sidonia.  French historians claim that Peter ordered two Jews to murder her;  another version of the story says she was poisoned; a third one that she was shot with a crossbow, although it may have been the plague. Also that year, Maria de Padilla died in Seville.

<p>From 1356 to 1366, Peter engaged in constant wars with Aragon in the "War of the Two Peters", in which he showed neither ability nor skill in his support of his English ally or Castilian interests in the Mediterranean against the French and Aragonese.  The king of Aragon then supported Peter's bastard brothers against him.  It was during this period that Peter perpetrated the series of murders which made him notorious.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In 1366 began the calamitous Castilian Civil War, which would see him dethroned.  He was assailed by his bastard brother Henry of Trast√°mara at the head of a host of soldiers of fortune, including Bertrand du Guesclin and Hugh Calveley, and abandoned the kingdom without daring to give battle, after retreating several times (first from Burgos, then from Toledo, and lastly from Seville) in the face of the oncoming armies. Peter fled with his treasury to Portugal, where he was coldly received by his uncle, King Peter I of Portugal, and thence to Galicia, in the northern Iberian Peninsula, where he ordered the murder of Suero, the archbishop of Santiago, and the dean, Peralvarez.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Peter_and_the_Spanish_Jewry">Peter and the Spanish Jewry</span></h2>
<p>Peter's rival Henry of Trast√°mara continuously depicted Peter as "King of the Jews", and had some success in taking advantage of popular Castilian resentment towards the Jews. Henry of Trast√°mara instigated pogroms beginning a period of anti-Jewish riots and forced conversions in Castile that lasted approximately from 1370 to 1390. Peter took forceful measures against this, including the execution of at least five anti-Jewish leaders of a riot.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The prominence of Samuel ha-Levi, King Peter's treasurer, has often been cited as evidence of Peter's supposed pro-Jewish sentiment, but Ha-Levi's success did not necessarily reflect the general experience of the Spanish Jewry in this period which was often marked by discrimination and pogroms. And even Samuel's career, including his arrest and death by torture, shows that the opportunities for Jews were restricted to certain offices and positions whereas other forms of advancement were denied to them.

<p>In the summer of 1366, Peter took refuge with Edward, the Black Prince, who restored him to his throne in the following year after the Battle of N√°jera. But he disgusted his ally with his faithlessness and ferocity, as well as his failure to repay the costs of the campaign, as he had promised to do.  The health of the Black Prince broke down, and he left the Iberian Peninsula.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Henry of Trast√°mara returned to Castile in September, 1368.  The <i>cortes</i> of the city of Burgos recognized him as King of Castile.  Others followed, including C√≥rdoba, Palencia, Valladolid, and Ja√©n.  Galicia and Asturias, on the other hand, continued to support Peter.  As Henry made his way toward Toledo, Peter, who had retreated to Andalusia, chose to confront him in battle.  On 14 March 1369, the forces of Peter and Henry met at Montiel, a fortress then controlled by the Order of Santiago.  Henry prevailed with the assistance of Bertrand du Guesclin.  Peter took refuge in the fortress, which, being controlled by a military order of Galician origin, remained faithful to him.  Negotiations were opened between Peter and his besieger, Henry.  Peter met with du Guesclin, who was acting as Henry's envoy.  Peter offered du Guesclin 200,000 gold coins and several towns, including Soria, Almazan, and Atienza to betray Henry. Ever opportunistic, du Guesclin informed Henry of the offer and immediately bargained for greater compensation from Henry to betray Peter.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>
Having made a deal with Henry, Du Guesclin returned to Peter. Under the guise of accepting his deal, du Guesclin led Peter to his tent on the night of 23 March 1369.  Henry was waiting.  The historian L√≥pez de Ayala described the encounter as follows:  <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><blockquote><p>Upon entering du Guesclin's tent, Henry "saw King Peter. He did not recognize him because they had not seen each other for a long time. One of Bertrand's men said 'This is your enemy.' But King Henry asked if it was he and ... King Peter said twice, 'I am he, I am he.' Then King Henry recognized him and hit him in the face with a knife and they ... fell to the ground. King Henry struck him again and again." <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p></blockquote><p> Having dispatched his half-brother, Henry left Peter's body unburied for three days, during which time it was subjected to ridicule and abuse.

<p>Popular memory generally views Peter as a vicious monster.  Much but not all of Peter's reputation comes from the works of the chronicler Pero L√≥pez de Ayala, who after his father's change of allegiance had little choice but to serve Peter's usurper. After time passed, there was a reaction in Peter's favour and an alternative name was found for him. It became a fashion to speak of him as <i>El Justiciero</i>, the executor of justice (the Lawful).  Apologists were found to say that he had killed only men who would not submit themselves to the law or respect the rights of others.  Peter did have his supporters. Even Ayala confessed that the king's fall was regretted by many, among them the peasants and burghers subjected to the nobles by late feudal gifts and by the merchants, who enjoyed security under his rule.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>The English, who backed Peter, also remembered the king positively.  Geoffrey Chaucer visited Castile during Peter's reign and lamented the monarch's death in <i>The Monk's Tale</i>, part of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. (Chaucer's patron, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, had fought on Peter's side in his struggle to reclaim the throne.) The English Lake Poet Robert Southey was presented in 1818 with a copy of a five-act play by the novelist Ann Doherty, entitled <i>Peter the Cruel, King of Castile and Leon</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Peter had many qualities of those later monarchs educated in the centralization style. He built a strong Royal administrative force ahead of his times. He failed to counter or check all the feudal powers that supported his rivals, however illegitimate and opposite to the principles of aristocracy they represented themselves. But his moral superiority was reduced too by the violent means, including fratricides, by which he sought to suppress opposition; he at times was extremely despotic and unpredictable, even by the standards of his age. In this he was preceded by his father Alfonso XI, who since the crisis at the death of Alfonso X had faced multiple rebellions against royal authority.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>The death of King Peter ended the traditional alliance of Castile and Navarre with England, which had been started by the Plantagenets to keep France in check. The alliance was later renewed by the Trast√°maras and Tudors.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Children">Children</span></h2>
<p>Peter's children by Mar√≠a de Padilla were:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p>
<ul><li>Beatrice (1353‚Äì1369), nun at the Abbey of Santa Clara at Tordesillas</li>
<li>Constance (1354‚Äì1394), married John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster</li>
<li>Isabella (1355‚Äì1392), married Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York</li>
<li>Alfonso (1359‚Äì1362), <i>Crown Prince of Castile and Le√≥n</i> (Tordesillas, 1359¬†‚Äì  19 October 1362). Peter forced the Cortes to recognize Alfonso as his legitimate heir on 29 April 1362. However, Alfonso, a very sickly child, died at the age of three, months from his recognition as Crown Prince.</li></ul>
<p>Peter had one son with Juana de Castro, daughter of Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<ul><li>John (1355‚Äì1405), married do√±a Elvira de Eril, had issue</li></ul>
<p>Peter had a daughter with Teresa de Ayala, a niece of Pero Lopez de Ayala:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p>
<ul><li>Maria de Ayala, who with her mother had long careers at the Dominican convent of Santo Domingo el Real in Toledo and maintained a friendly correspondence with the Trast√°maras</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sources">Sources</span></h2>
<p>The great original but hostile authority for the life of Peter the Cruel is the <i>Chronicle of the Chancellor Pedro L√≥pez de Ayala</i> (1332‚Äì1407).  To put that in perspective are a biography by Prosper M√©rim√©e, <i>Histoire de Don Pedro I, roi de Castille</i> (1848) and a modern history setting Peter in the social and economic context of his time by Clara Estow (<i>Pedro the Cruel of Castile (1350‚Äì1369)</i>, 1995).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Strictly speaking, Peter was not defeated by Henry but by the opposing aristocracy; the nobles accomplished their objective of enthroning a weaker dynasty (the House of Trast√°mara), much more amenable to their interests. Most of the bad stories about Peter are likely to be colored by Black Legend, coined by his enemies, who finally succeeded in their rebellion. The Chancellor L√≥pez de Ayala, the main source for Peter's reign, was the official chronicler of the Trast√°mara, a servant of the new rulers and of Peter's aristocratic adversaries.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>The change of dynasty can be considered as the epilogue of the first act of a long struggle between the Castilian monarchy and the aristocracy; this struggle was to continue for more than three centuries and come to an end only under Charles I of Spain, the grandson of Ferdinand II of Aragon (Ferdinand V of Castile) and Isabella I of Castile (The Catholic Monarchs), in the first quarter of the 16th century.
