<p><b>Kurt "Kuddel" Ubben</b> (18 November 1911 – 27 April 1944) was a German Luftwaffe wing commander and military aviator during World War II, a fighter ace listed with 110 aerial victories—that is, 110 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft—claimed in approximately 500 combat missions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Born in Dorstadt, Ubben volunteered for military service with the <i>Reichsmarine</i> in 1931. He transferred to the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany in 1935. Following flight training, he was posted to <i>Jagdgruppe</i> 186 (JG 186—186 Fighter Group) and later to <i>Jagdgeschwader</i> 77 (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing). He claimed his first aerial victory during the Battle of France on 10 May 1940. In July 1940, he was appointed <i>Staffelkapitän</i> (squadron leader) of 8. <i>Staffel</i> (8th squadron) of JG 77. With this unit, Ubben then fought in the Battle of Greece and Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 4 September 1941 and was given command of III. <i>Gruppe</i> (3rd group) of JG 77 two days later. His unit transferred to the North African Theatre of operations, taking part in the retreat from Tunisia to Sicily and Italy. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 23 July 1942 and claimed his 101st aerial victory in January 1943.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In March 1944, Ubben was appointed <i>Geschwaderkommodore</i> (wing commander) of <i>Jagdgeschwader</i> 2 "Richthofen" (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing), tasked with defense of the Reich missions. He was killed in action in aerial combat with United States Army Air Forces 356th Fighter Group near Fère-en-Tardenois, France on 27 April 1944.

On 1 October 1931, he joined the military service with the <i>Reichsmarine</i>, the German Navy during the Weimar Republic. During his service with the <i>Reichsmarine</i>, he went on a cruise on board the school ship <i>Gorch Fock</i>. On 1 April 1935, Ubben transferred to the newly emerging Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany and was trained as a naval aviator in 1935/36.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>On 1 September 1936, Ubben was transferred to 1. <i>Staffel</i> (1st squadron) of <i>Jagdgeschwader</i> 136 (JG 136—136th Fighter Wing), and in November was posted to the newly created I. <i>Gruppe</i> (1st group) of <i>Jagdggruppe</i> 186 (II./186—186th Fighter Group). This group, also known as the <i>Trägerfliegergruppe</i> (carrier flyers group), was destined to be stationed on the aircraft carrier <i><i>Graf Zeppelin</i></i> which was never completed. II./186 (T) initially consisted of two squadrons, 4./186 (T) equipped with the Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber, and 6./186 (T), a fighter squadron to which Ubben was assigned. At the time, 6./186 (T) was equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109B, the carrier variant Bf 109 T-1 was not available, and trained at Travemünde on a mockup carrier landing deck. On 15 July 1939, II./186 (T) was augmented by a third squadron, designated 5./186 (T) to which Ubben was transferred.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="World_War_II">World War II</span></h2>
<p>World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. In preparation, 5./186 had been moved to Brüsterort, near Königsberg on 22 August. In the early morning hours of 1 September, 5./186 flew its first combat missions, providing fighter protection for 4./186 attacking the naval base of the Polish Navy at Hel and for the old German battleship <i>Schleswig-Holstein</i> bombarding the Polish military transit depot at Westerplatte in the Free City of Danzig on the Baltic Sea. The next, II./186 flew further bomber escort missions and was withdrawn from this theater on 6 September, relocating to Hage, East Frisia.
Ubben first aerial success was a Dutch Fokker D.XXI fighter claimed over the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the opening day of the Battle of France. This earned him the Iron Cross 2nd Class (<i lang="de" title="German language text">Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse</i>) that day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Holding the rank of <i>Oberfeldwebel</i> (sergeant), Ubben was transferred to III. <i>Gruppe</i> of <i>Jagdgeschwader</i> 77 (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing) where he was assigned to 8. <i>Staffel</i>. There, on 1 May 1940, he was promoted to <i>Leutnant</i> (second lieutenant) with a rank age dated back to 1 October 1936, and at the same time received the rank of <i>Oberleutnant</i> (first lieutenant) of the reserves with a rank age dated back to 1 June 1939.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>On 22 July 1940, Ubben was made <i>Staffelkapitän</i> (squadron leader) of 8. <i>Staffel</i> of JG 77. On 1 February 1942, Ubben was promoted to <i>Hauptmann</i> (captain) and became an active officer.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Balkan_and_Battle_of_Crete">Balkan and Battle of Crete</span></h3>
<p>The unit transferred to the Balkans in April 1941. Ubben claimed a No. 33 Squadron Hawker Hurricane fighter over Greece on 19 April, although his Bf 109 E-7 (<i>Werknummer</i> 5198—factory number) was badly damaged in the engagement and Ubben forced-landed behind Allied lines near Doblatan. He was rescued by a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch and flown back to his unit. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s during the battle, though only three were brought down. Among the claimants was RAF ace Marmaduke Pattle, who claimed two Bf 109s shot down. Ubben may have been one of his victims.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Ubben also carried out many ground-attack and fighter-bomber operations against Allied naval forces during mid-1941. On 22 May 1941, Ubben and <i>Oberleutnant</i> Wolf-Dietrich Huy claimed hits on the Royal Navy battleship HMS <i>Warspite</i>. A bomb damaged her starboard 4-inch and 6-inch batteries, ripped open the ship's side and killed 38 men.

<p>Ubben and JG 77 then participated in the invasion of Russia in June 1941. He claimed a 21st victory on 25 July. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (<i lang="de" title="German language text">Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes</i>) in September for 32 air kills, 26 aircraft destroyed on the ground and some 15 armoured vehicles claimed destroyed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In September 1941, <i>Hauptmann</i> Ubben was promoted to <i>Gruppenkommandeur</i> (group commander) of III./JG 77. He achieved 50 kills on 19 October, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (<i lang="de" title="German language text">Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub</i>) on 12 March 1942 for 69 victories. The presentation was made on 5 April 1942 by Adolf Hitler at the <i>Führer</i> Headquarter <i>Wolfsschanze</i> in Rastenburg (now Kętrzyn in Poland). Also present at the award ceremony were the fighter pilots <i>Hauptmann</i> (Captain) Hans Philipp who received the Swords and <i>Oberleutnant</i> Max-Hellmuth Ostermann who also received the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mediterranean_Theater_and_Romania">Mediterranean Theater and Romania</span></h3>
<p>III./JG 77 was then transferred to North Africa, by which time Ubben had 92 victories. He claimed his 100th victory on 14 January 1943. He was the 33rd Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark.
On 1 October 1943, Ubben claimed a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress shot down in the vicinity of Livorno, Italy. According to Graham, the B-17 was an aircraft from the 301st Bombardment Group, 352d Bombardment Squadron, lost in the vicinity of Lucca. That day, he was promoted to <i>Major</i> (major). When the <i>Geschwaderkommodore</i> (wing commander) of JG 77, <i>Oberstleutnant</i> Johannes Steinhoff, went on vacation on 3 October, Ubben temporarily was put in command of JG 77, leading the <i>Geschwader</i> from the command post in Albano.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>On 24 October, Ubben received orders to move III. <i>Gruppe</i> to Romania. Leaving all aircraft in Italy, the <i>Gruppe</i> went to Mizil the next day by train. There, it provided aerial protection over the Ploiești oilfields. In Mizil, the Gruppe was equipped with the then outdated Bf 109 G-2, newer variants were unavailable. Training flight operations began on 12 November. On 19 January 1944, <i>General der Jagdflieger</i>, <i>Generalmajor</i> Adolf Galland visited Ubben at Mizil. Galland stressed the importance of the Ploiești fields to the German war effort. He requested the pilots of III. <i>Gruppe</i> to sign an order stating, in case of a last resort, they would have to perform aerial ramming in defense of the oil fields.

<p>On 2 March 1944, <i>Oberstleutnant</i> Egon Mayer, <i>Geschwaderkommodore</i> (wing commander) of <i>Jagdgeschwader</i> 2 "Richthofen" (JG 2—2nd Fighter Wing) was killed in action in aerial combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) fighter aircraft. In consequence, Ubben succeeded Mayer in this command position. JG 2 "Richthofen", named after the after World War I fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen, was based in France and was engaged in Defense of the Reich. Ubben left his former III. <i>Gruppe</i> on 10 March, assuming his new command in March 1944.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>On 27 April 1944, Ubben engaged United States Army Air Forces P-47 fighters near Fère-en-Tardenois. In the ensuing combat, Ubben was shot down in Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-8/R2 (<i>Werknummer</i> 680 113—factory number). He bailed out but his parachute failed to open either due to insufficient altitude or because of an improperly fastened harness. Ubben is interred at the Saint-Désir-de-Lisieux German war cemetery.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aerial_victory_claims">Aerial victory claims</span></h3>
<p>Matthews and Foreman, authors of <i>Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims</i>, researched the German Federal Archives and found documentation for 93 aerial victory claims, plus 13 further unconfirmed claims. This number includes 16 on the Western Front, including one four-engined bomber, and 77 on the Eastern Front.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Victory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = <i>Planquadrat</i>), for example "PQ 17692". The Luftwaffe grid map (<i lang="de" title="German language text">Jägermeldenetz</i>) covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude, an area of about 360 square miles (930 km). These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 × 4 km in size.
