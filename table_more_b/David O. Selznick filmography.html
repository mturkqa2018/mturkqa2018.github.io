Selznick</div></div></div>
<p>David O. Selznick (1902–1965) was an American motion picture producer whose work consists of three short subjects, 67 feature films, and one television production made between 1923 and 1957. He was the producer of the 1939 epic <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. Selznick was born in Pittsburgh and educated in public schools in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He began working in the film industry in New York while in his teens as an assistant to his father, jeweler-turned-film producer Lewis J. Selznick. In 1923, he began producing films himself, starting with two documentary shorts and then a minor feature, <i>Roulette</i> (1924). Moving to Hollywood in 1926, Selznick became employed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where he produced two films before switching to Paramount in early 1928. After helping to guide Paramount into the sound era, Selznick moved to RKO Radio in 1931 where he served as the studio's executive producer. During his time at RKO he oversaw the production of <i>King Kong</i> (1933) and helped to develop Katharine Hepburn and Myrna Loy into major film stars.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>In 1933 Selznick returned to MGM, this time as a vice-president in charge of his own production unit. During his two years with the studio he produced elaborate versions of Leo Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i> and Charles Dickens' <i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. In 1935, he left MGM to form his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, where he produced adaptations of Robert Smythe Hichens' <i>The Garden of Allah</i> (1936), Frances Hodgson Burnett's <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i> (1936), Anthony Hope's <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> (1937), and Mark Twain's <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> (1938). Selznick also became a pioneer in the use of Technicolor with the first and last of these films and also with his productions of <i>A Star is Born</i> and <i>Nothing Sacred</i> (both 1937). In 1939 Selznick brought Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman to the United States to star in <i>Intermezzo</i> and the following year he brought Alfred Hitchcock over from England to direct <i>Rebecca</i>. Also in 1939, Selznick produced his epic version of Margaret Mitchell's <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, which became the most financially successful film of all time.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Selznick liquidated his corporation in the early 1940s but returned to independent producing in 1943. His work from this period included two more Hitchcock films, <i>Spellbound</i> (1945) and <i>The Paradine Case</i> (1948) and several films starring Jennifer Jones, among them <i>Since You Went Away</i> (1944), <i>Duel in the Sun</i> (1946) and <i>Portrait of Jennie</i> (1948).  Selznick ceased his independent productions in 1948. Beginning with Carol Reed's <i>The Third Man</i> (1949), he entered into a period of co-producing motion pictures with other filmmakers.  In 1954, he made his sole venture into television with the production <i>Light's Diamond Jubilee</i>. Selznick retired from filmmaking after producing an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> (1957).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Selznick's productions were the recipients of numerous Academy Award nominations.  Two of his films—<i>Gone With the Wind</i> and <i>Rebecca</i>—won Academy Awards for Best Picture. Six other films that he produced—<i>Viva Villa!</i> (1934), <i>David Copperfield</i> (1935), <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> (1935), <i>A Star is Born</i> (1937), <i>Since You Went Away</i> (1944), and <i>Spellbound</i> (1945)—were nominated for Best Picture. As of 2013, four of the films Selznick produced have been added to the National Film Registry: <i>King Kong</i> (1933), <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i> (1937), <i>Gone With the Wind</i> (1939), and <i>The Third Man</i> (1949). For his work in motion pictures, Selznick received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<p>The release dates, titles, and names of the directors for Selznick's films are derived from the filmographies presented in the books <i>Memo From David O. Selznick</i> by Rudy Behlmer and <i>David O. Selznick's Hollywood</i> by Ronald Haver.  The quotes are derived from Behlmer's book.

<p>Selznick began working in the film industry while in his early teens.  He was employed—after school hours—by his father, film producer Lewis J. Selznick, initially as head of publicity and advertising and later as a newsreel Film editor.  When the elder Selznick went bankrupt in 1923, young David took a job as a promoter for a two-reel short about prizefighter Luis Firpo. Afterwards he convinced the Mineralava Beauty Clay Company to produce a two-reel film of a beauty contest they were sponsoring with actor Rudolph Valentino as the judge.

<p>In early 1928 Selznick accepted the position of assistant to producer B. P. Schulberg at Paramount Studios.  The professional relationship between the two, however, eventually deteriorated after Schulberg went to Europe for several months in 1929.  During his absence, studio head Jesse L. Lasky placed Selznick into Schulberg's position and decided to keep him there.  Selznick remained with Paramount until his resignation in June 1931.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Selznick worked in a variety of jobs (i.e. supervisor, producer, associate producer, executive producer, or substantial contributor).

In October 1931, I signed a contract to take over both and to merge them. I stayed at RKO until my contract expired in 1933.  My new contract … was about to be signed when "Deac" Aylesworth became head of the company. Aylesworth insisted upon the new but still unsigned contract being changed to the extent of giving him approval of everything connected with production.

<p>In 1931 Selznick and director Lewis Milestone attempted to form their own production company. After several months, however, the two were unsuccessful in achieving financial backing.  Milestone eventually accepted an offer to because head of production at United Artists while Selznick accepted a similar position at RKO Radio.

Selznick International produced a total of 11 features, of which all but one were distributed by United Artists. <i>Gone With the Wind</i> was released by MGM as part of a deal with Selznick in exchange for the loan of Clark Gable in the role of Rhett Butler.

<p>Following the highly successful releases of <i>Gone With the Wind</i> and <i>Rebecca</i>, Selznick began a three-year liquidation of Selznick International Pictures in order to draw profits for himself and his outside investors. He developed and sold film projects to other producers and studios, and arranged loan outs of his contracted artists. Without outside backers he formed David O. Selznick Productions, Inc., which in 1941 became owner of one-fourth of United Artists.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Selznick established a film production company, Vanguard Films (1943–1951). The first three features for his new company were distributed by United Artists. In 1946 Selznick broke with UA over the distribution of <i>Duel in the Sun</i>, and founded his own distribution company, Selznick Releasing Organization.

<p>In 1949 Selznick closed down his production facilities and he greatly reduced the staff of Selznick Releasing Organization. He and Jennifer Jones began traveling in Europe and were married in July 1949. For the remainder of his career he collaborated with other film producers and also made his sole venture into television.
