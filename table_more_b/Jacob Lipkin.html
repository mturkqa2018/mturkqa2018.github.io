<p><b>Jacob Lipkin (1909-1996), An American Sculptor</b>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Jacob Lipkin, an American sculptor, was born April 19, 1909 
in New York Cityâ€™s Lower East Side. 
Lipkin carved in stone and wood with a humanistâ€™s sensibility, 
often using "creatures and people from mythology to convey the harmonious connection between Man and Nature" (from a quote by Koren Der Harootian, in the Village Art Center Catalog, circa 1954).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Between 1937 and 1940, Lipkin studied art in Manhattan at the Educational alliance, The Cooper Union, Art Students League of New York and Leonardo da Vinci Art School.
By 1940, Lipkin devoted himself fully to sculpting. He worked and lived his last 40 years in the modest home, studio, and sculpture garden he had built himself in the Township of Babylon, N.Y.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Lipkinâ€™s work was exhibited with artists including Chaim Gross, Louise Bourgeois, Louise Nevelson, and Isamu Noguchi in the 1940s to 1950s including at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Providence Art Club, New Jersey Society of Painters and showings at public museums including the Brooklyn Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_Life"><b>Early Life</b></span></h2>
<p>Jacob Lipkin was born on April 19, 1909 to Russian-Jewish (now Ukrainian) immigrants. His parents immigrated to the United States during the period between 1890 and 1910 that saw more than 10 million European people come to the U.S.in the Settlement movement. According to Richard Rivera, Lipkin's biographer, Jacob was the 15th of 16 children and as the first of his family to be born in America "became a product of the Lower East Side". Jacob grew up in a community where social organizations such as The Educational Alliance, the Henry Street Settlement, and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) had been formed to facilitate the transition of â€œAmericanization.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In the Newsday article, â€œA Sculptorâ€™s Love, Art Come Home,â€ by Samson Mulugeta, Rivera states that, â€œWhen he [Jacob] was 5, his father died, and he was sent to an orphanage.â€ Lipkinâ€™s father had worked for the New York Edison Company (previously Consolidated Edison), and although Jacob had adult siblings he was placed into an orphanage by his mother where he remained for three years.

The only Lipkin sculpture ever cast in bronze, it was made to honor the 9,500 merchant marines killed in World War II. Originally donated to the Seamanâ€™s Church Institute of New York in 1953, it was stolen in 1973, then recovered in 2016.</div></div></div><p>He was liberated from the orphanage three years later by one of his brothers seeking recusal from the military service in the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1917.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Jacob Lipkin was apprenticed to a blacksmith at the age of 12. Four years later as a 16-year-old living on Manhattanâ€™s South Street, he lied about his age and sailed out on one of the last of commercial sailing shipsâ€”a 3-mast wooden barquentineâ€”as a merchant seaman.  For 11 years, Lipkin sailed the world aboard cargo ships and oil tankers before once again making New York City and the Lower East Side his home.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Lipkin was described in the Newsday article â€œOne Manâ€™s Poetry,â€ as a man â€œof immense curiosityâ€ and â€œself-educated.â€ He was a great admirer of John Brown (abolitionist), and his avowed emphasis racial equality.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Artistic_Pursuits_and_Family_Life"><b>Artistic Pursuits and Family Life</b></span></h2>
<p>Jacob Lipkin returned home to New York City in 1936, and by 1937 he was studying art at The Cooper Union, and the Leonardo da Vinci Art School where he learned carving in stone and wood in the evenings.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>From 1932 to 1948 Jacob Lipkin created a number of oil paintings of New York scenes, a self-portrait, and wood sculptures, including Head of a Woman No. 1, 1940, in oak, and Pioneer (Head of Woman), 1950, Lignum Vitae, 19 inches high, in the collection of the New Jersey State Museum; Owl, 1948, in lignum vitae, 21.5 x 8 x 10 inches; and Shark, 1948, in Teakwood. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>During the late 1930s at a party, Lipkin met Dorothy Koegan, his future wife. As stated by Estelle Lander in the January 4, 1990 Newsday article â€œOne Manâ€™s Poetry,â€ Lipkin â€œsat next to her because a beautiful blonde â€˜in good shapeâ€™ sat on the other side. But [the blonde] was stupid, Dorothy Lipkin said, so he turned to me. Then he found out I had hidden beauty.â€ They married and had a daughter, Laura, and later, a son, Carl.

As quoted from the article â€œCapturing a Sculptor in Stone and Filmâ€ by Barbara Delatiner, Sunday New York Times, April 10, 1988, Lipkin said, â€œIn the beginning I sold here and there. But the more immersed I became in morals and mores I realized I couldn't sell my work. The thought of selling was detrimental,â€ Lipkin said, â€œit corrodes the creative spirit. I have this need for freedom. And money is a threat as well as a grace. I need freedom to create my works of art.â€ And so he preferred to donate his work to public institutions to be enjoyed by the public.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>To support the family Jacob taught fine art or cleaned cellars, or hauled loads in his 1-ton truck and Dorothy worked as a secretary. â€œWhen there was money, we ate better. When there was no money we ate Chinese-style, with a lot of rice and vegetables,â€ Dorothy is quoted as saying in the January 4, 1990 Newsday article "One Manâ€™s Poetry" by Estelle Lander.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>During the 1950â€™s Jacob Lipkin was elected a signature member of the Knickerbocker Artists, contributing to many exhibitions in the Lower East Side and throughout the New York City area, as mentioned in two New York Times exhibition reviews â€œAbout Art and Artistsâ€ by Howard Devree. In the November 2, 1954 article with subhead â€œSculpture by Moore at Valentinâ€™s Includes Piece Spurned on Madison Avenueâ€ Devree notes that the â€œshow at the Riverside Museum by the Brooklyn Society of Artists and â€œPrizes â€¦ In the sculpture awards went to Joseph Konzal and Jacob Lipkin â€¦â€ and in his May 5, 1954 article with subhead â€œFive Sculpture Shows Offered in Weekâ€”Valentin Assembles Rodin Exhibitionâ€ Devree says, â€œThe third group exhibition event is a show of work in a variety of materials by ten invited sculptors at the Studio Gallery of Marcia Clapp, 170 East Seventy-fifth Street. Outstanding are a granite head, <i>Prophet</i>, by Jane Wasey and <i>Ape</i>, a squat powerful figure in the same intractable material, by Jacob Lipkin, who is also represented by a befittingly stolid <i>Turtle</i> in green stone, and the highly stylized figure, <i>Echo</i>, by Koren der Harootian in imperial marble.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>On at least three occasions in the 1960â€™s his sculptures were used as illustrations in the New York Times book review section. Sculptures included the <i>Whale</i>, in walnut, 1946, September 9, 1962 in the edition; the <i>Seahorse</i>, 16 inches high in African walnut, 1950, in the August 8, 1966 edition; and the <i>Adolescent</i>, 40 x 15.5 x 9 inches in rosewood, 1956, in the February 16, 1958 edition.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Caster_Controversy_and_the_New_York_Times_Coverage"><b>Caster Controversy and the New York Times Coverage</b></span></h2>
<p>On January 7, 1960, the front page of the New York Times ran the story: â€œSculptor, a Barter Artist, Blocks Sale of Work to Pay a $153 Debtâ€ written by Ira Henry Freeman. Jacob Lipkin decided in 1959 that he needed an industrial grade dolly to wheel around his thousand-pound marble blocks. He went to Eugene Gomes, owner of the Kilian Caster Sales Company, promising to give him a work of art, a sculpture, in exchange for the â€œsmooth-turning noiseless heavy pneumatic tires requiredâ€ (from New York Daily News article, <i>Man Who Hates Money</i>). When Mr. Gomes, who also owned an art gallery in Westchester, New York, came eagerly to the St. Markâ€™s studio to claim a sculpture of his choosing as payment he found that Lipkin did not do abstract art. Jacob Lipkin offered him a four-foot female nude carved in rosewood whose raw material alone had been worth $300. He also showed Gomes a ramâ€™s head in travertine marble, but Gomes would not accept it, leaving instead empty-handed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>In the New York Times article, Lipkin is quoted as saying, â€œIs life abstract? Is an auction sale abstract, a toothache abstract, children maimed by war abstract? Is Love abstract â€¦ Is it abstract to lie on the bowsprit of a 250-foot schooner under full sailâ€”as I have doneâ€”and watch the whale leap out of the Pacific? My works assert the goodness of life. Abstract art is the fad of tasteless tastemakers who hate humanity and nature. It will pass in time.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Mr. Gomes went to an attorney who received a judgment and a marshall. He would â€œsell what he could to satisfy the judgmentâ€ according to the NYTimes. The â€œmarshall was assigned to collect or force an auction of Lipkinâ€™s works to pay the debtâ€ according to the New York Daily News. He was determined to collect or force an auctioning away of as many pieces of Jacobâ€™s work as necessary to fulfill his $153 payment. When Jacob Lipkin finally became aware of the legal actions Gomes was taking, he rushed to the Legal Aid Society to block the motion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>The New York Times front-page story created nationwide support for the artist. Donations poured in from across the nation totaling over $8,300 in checks and cash, but Lipkin refused to accept the donations stating, â€œI am not a charity. I cannot take money I did not earn.â€ And when asked of his dependents and their opinion, he said, â€œâ€¦ they would lose all respect for me â€¦ they are more idealistic than I am.â€ He then related that, â€œA little girl sent me three $1 bills with a note saying she was sacrificing a piano lesson to help me. A workman in overalls stopped in last night after work and tried to force upon me the few dollars he had in his pocket. He said he would bring me more next payday. I had to walk away or I'd have bust out crying.â€  And he went on to say â€œIt is an inspiring thing,â€ Lipkin said, â€œto see the generosity of people, [and] their respect for a sincere artist,â€ but he would not accept the donations.

Seeking a way to carve large stones that would not fit in the St. Mark's studio, he built a house in Babylon. Initially living in a tent during the construction, and over the years adding a separate studio that housed an anvil and forge, he found a way to fulfill his creativity and carve his largest pieces. Utilizing the skills he had acquired as a boy when apprenticed to a blacksmith, Lipkin occasionally made his own tools in Babylon.

Lipkin, then 54 years of age, described to Robert Weiss what he hoped to accomplish, â€œâ€¦ the figure of a man partly relieved from the stone because Man himself is only partly relieved from the world. The figure also represents a father image which this nation needs.â€ Robert Weiss went on to say, the <i>Socrates</i> sculpture, â€œWhen his statue is finished, Lipkin hopes to donate it to a large museum or institution.â€ Four years later he had completed his sculpture, <i>Socrates, The Prophet</i>.

Eight-feet high and carved from Radio Black, Vermont marble, the sculpture was originally installed at JFK Plaza in Philadelphia but now stands at Cret Park and Ben Franklin Parkway.</div></div></div><p>Jacob Lipkin preferred to donate his sculptures to public institutions where they could be enjoyed by the public rather than selling to private collectors, according to the New York Times. But,  due to financial constraints and having to support a family, he also bartered his artworks for services when needed, â€œThatâ€™s the way I get along. I made my dentist a lovely rooster in wood, and he made me a beautiful bridge in porcelain. A veterinarian altered one of my cats, so I carved a squirrel in stone as payment.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>In 1967 Lipkin offered the eight-foot high <i>Socrates, The Prophet</i> to the township of Babylon where it could be erected at the City Hall. The town leadership refused. Then Lipkin spoke to a personal friend, Robert A. Donner, a Philadelphia resident who worked in Philadelphia as a political liaison with the Parkâ€™s department. Donner spoke to Paul M. Ingersoll, the Vice-President of the Provident National Bank and Ingersoll became intrigued with Lipkinâ€™s work. A 30-year retrospective exhibition of Lipkinâ€™s work was planned and the bank insured over 40 of Lipkinâ€™s works for $14 million in order to ship the sculptures to Philadelphia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>On April 25, 1968, the two-month exhibition had its official opening in the marbled gallery of the Provident National Bank. <i>Socrates, The Prophet</i>, was not in the exhibition gallery. It had been dedicated a week before and placed in the John F. Kennedy Plaza, Philadelphia. At the opening, the curator of the Philadelphia Zoo expressed his desire in having the <i>Ape</i>, a small granite sculpture Lipkin had carved. It was then purchased and became a permanent part of the zooâ€™s collection of fine art.

<h2><span id="The_Film_From_Stone:_Jacob_Lipkin.2C_An_American_Sculptor"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Film_From_Stone:_Jacob_Lipkin,_An_American_Sculptor"><b>The Film <i>From Stone: Jacob Lipkin, An American Sculptor</i></b></span></h2>
<p>According to Barbara Delatiner article in the New York Times story, in 1979 Phil Katzman was introduced to Jacob Lipkin by a mutual friend. Katzman, a filmmaker, who was teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York City had grown up in one of the neighboring towns on Long Island. He found Lipkin to be â€œan interesting characterâ€ and visited him over a year-and-a-half â€œto get to know Jacob, see if there was a film to be made.â€ He saw Lipkin as â€œan artist who had no choice but to do what he had to do, a modern-day <i>Icarus</i>.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>The film was, in Katzmanâ€™s words, â€œa labor of love.â€ Katzmanâ€™s aim was to create a timeless portrait of the artist. Lipkin was about to begin working on a new piece of sculpture and Katzman wanted to capture the process on film. The new sculpture would be called <i>Icarus</i>, which Lipkin saw as a prophetic metaphor. It was to be Jacobâ€™s last work.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Over the seven years it took Katzman to finalize his film he exhausted his budget of $25,000 and $2,000 in grants even though he usually worked with student volunteers as film crews.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>As <i>Icarus</i> evolved through the seasons, Katzman filmed Lipkin in marble quarries, sculpting, and discussing his philosophy of art and life. Lipkin lived, worked, and ate surrounded by his sculpture, alone in Babylon and every few months he would go into New York to see his family.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>Jacob Lipkin began carving the 6-foot-tall <i>Icarus</i> when he was 72 years of age. It took three years of carving for <i>Icarus</i> to be completed. Lipkin never carved again.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Phil Katzmanâ€™s film, <i>From Stone: Jacob Lipkin, An American Sculptor</i>, premiered at the North Babylon Public Library on April 16, 1988; one day before Jacobâ€™s 79th birthday. <i>From Stone</i> screened on PBS and internationally and won four film festival awards.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Township_of_Babylon_On_and_Off"><b>Township of Babylon On and Off</b></span></h2>
<p>In the film <i>From Stone</i> Lipkin states, â€œBefore I die I would like to see my work and this quarter acre as a museum, open to the public, free of charge of course. Iâ€™ve contacted the powers that be, the City Hall here in Babylon, three times, and theyâ€™ve turned me down.â€ The reasons for the townâ€™s refusal was outlined in The Long Island newspaper, Newsday, January 4, 1990 article that stated, â€œFor years, then, he [Lipkin] knocked on the doors of the Babylon town hall, offering his lifeâ€™s work to each administration. For years, he got no takers: Officials feared hordes descending on Silver Street with nowhere to park, and increased taxes for maintenance of a museum.â€&lt;
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>For many years Jacob Lipkin had posted a sign at his gate proclaiming, â€œSculpture Museum, Visitors Invited,â€ and he would welcome all who were interested in learning about the sculptures.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>The Long Island newspaper, Newsday, documented the impasse in a January 4, 1990 article, â€œFor years, then, he [Lipkin] knocked on the doors of the Babylon town hall, offering his lifeâ€™s work to each administration. For years, he got no takers: Officials feared hordes descending on Silver Street with nowhere to park, and increased taxes for maintenance of a museum.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>But in 1987 the new Town Supervisor, Arthur G. Pitts, said he was more receptive to Lipkinâ€™s proposal that the previous governance, and in the January 4, 1990 Newsday article by Estelle Lander, Pitts is quoted as saying of the Lipkin property, â€œWhen I go to his house and look at the sculpture, it moves me. Itâ€™s like finding a rose in the middle of a weed garden.â€ The town council under the leadership of Pitts accepted Lipkinâ€™s property and sculptures as gift to the town. The Newsday article also stated that, â€œâ€¦ papers are being drawn up for the transfer of the property from Lipkin to the town â€¦ Lipkin will stay there rent-free, and will no longer have to pay town and school taxes.â€

In a January 16, 1996 another Newsday article â€œThe Not-So-Artful Dealâ€ by Caryn Eve Murray stated that the new town supervisor claimed that Lipkin, â€œnever gave the town this property â€¦ he never gave the town a deed until he signed one in October of 1995.â€ Murray goes on to say that Lipkin insisted that the deed had been filed and proper paperwork signed in 1990 by him and his wife Dorothy. However the town claimed that since the deed had never been filed and that Lipkin owed the town nearly $14,700 in unpaid property taxes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Jacob Lipkin died on April 27, 1996. After several weeks, Jacobâ€™s son, Carl Lipkin (1945-2018), worked out an agreement with the town and Suffolk County and paid the back taxes in full. A Newsday article of May 19, 1996 stated, â€œCarl Lipkin was not unhappy that bureaucratic bungling by the Town of Babylon â€¦ returned to his family what he considers to be its rightful inheritance.â€ Ultimately, all of the sculptures and artwork reverted back to Jacob Lipkin's estate.

<p>â€œIs life abstract? Is an auction sale abstract, a toothache abstract, children maimed by war abstract? Abstract art is the fad of tasteless taste-makers who hate humanity and nature. It will pass in time.â€ Jacob Lipkin, quoted in â€œSculptor, A Barter Artist, Blocks Sale of Work to Pay a $153 Debtâ€ January 7, 1960, New York Times by Ira Henry Freeman
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>â€œMy works assert the goodness of life.â€ Jacob Lipkin, quoted â€œThe Man Who Hates Moneyâ€ by Kermit Jaediker. New York Daily News, Sunday News, January 31, 1960, page 3. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>â€œThe instant that consciousness became aware of itself Man became Man â€¦ [he] knew immediately that materials of which the world was made were the same as those from which he was created. His consciousness was shared by all matter.â€ 
â€”from Jacob Lipkinâ€™s essay <i>The Prophecy in Art</i> from Lipkin's website: http://www.riveraartse.com/lipkin_about.html

This work is one of four sculptures installed on the North Terrace that illustrates the "inner energies" which shaped this country. The Scientist, an symbol of the impulse that has spurred the country's intellectual and technological development, is a male figure walking with his proper left leg forward and his proper right arm across his chest. He holds a book in his proper right hand and looks off into the distance to his proper right. He is dressed in loose drapery and has a moustache.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><b>^</b></span> <span class="reference-text">Village Art Center Catalog, circa 1954, "Through direct carving and an economy of statement dictated by the hard materials, Jacob Lipkin has conveyed a humanistâ€™s statement of the spiritual unity of man and animal. The inner vitality of his forms and the elimination of non-essential detail have revealed the essence of the animal and thereby an affirmation of life in harmony with nature. In the studies of children we see a sensitive sympathy for the childâ€™s moods and grasp of the childâ€™s true significance, that he is 'father to the man.' Jacob Lipkinâ€˜s sculpture is basically the concrete representation of a faith in man who can be and integral and harmonious part of his environment." quote by Koren der Harootian</span>
