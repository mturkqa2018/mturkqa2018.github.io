<p>SRÂ 32 begins at an intersection with SRÂ 45/SRÂ 520 in Dawson, within Terrell County. Approximately 3,500 feet (1,100Â m) later, it meets the western terminus of SRÂ 118 (Crawford Street NE). Then, it leaves town, heading east. On the eastern city limits is Chickasawhatchee Cemetery. Farther to the east is Bethel Cemetery. After the highway enters Lee County, it curves to the south-southeast. Then, it gradually curves to the southeast. Just before entering Leesburg, SRÂ 32 curves to the northeast, crosses over Kinchafoonee Creek, and then curves to the east. In town, it intersects USÂ 19 Byp./SRÂ 3 Byp. The three highways travel concurrent to the southeast for just over 1,000 feet (300Â m), to an intersection with USÂ 19/SRÂ 3 (Walnut Street). At this intersection, USÂ 19 Byp./SRÂ 3 Byp. meet their southern terminus, and SRÂ 32 travels to the north, concurrent with USÂ 19/SRÂ 3. At 4th Street East, SRÂ 32 departs the concurrency to the east northeast. One block later, it meets the southern terminus of SRÂ 195 (Leslie Highway). At this intersection, it turns to the south-southeast and curves to the east. Just before leaving town, the highway passes Leesburg Cemetery. Farther to the east, it crosses over Muckalee Creek. Then, it meets the northern terminus of SRÂ 91 before crossing over the Flint River into Worth County. Just under 2 miles (3.2Â km) into the county, it intersects SRÂ 300 (Georgiaâ€“Florida Parkway). It curves southeast to an intersection with SRÂ 313 in Doles. Continuing to the southeast, it intersects SRÂ 33. Just over 0.5 miles (0.80Â km) later, it enters Turner County. The highway curves back to the northeast and enters Ashburn. In the city, it intersects SRÂ 112 (West Washington Street). The two highways begin a concurrency to the main part of the city. At the intersection with USÂ 41/SRÂ 7, SRÂ 112 continues to the northeast, while SRÂ 32 turns right onto USÂ 41/SRÂ 7. The three highways head concurrent into Sycamore. Just outside Ashburn, they pass the Turner County Airport.

<p>In Sycamore, SRÂ 32 splits off to the east-northeast and immediately meets the eastern terminus of SRÂ 32 Conn. Just to the east is an interchange with InterstateÂ 75 (I-75). Then, it passes Pleasant Hill Cemetery and curves to the east. After that, it passes Bethel Cemetery and curves again to the southeast. Later on, it curves to the east-northeast and enters Irwin County a short distance later. SRÂ 32 curves to the northeast and begins a concurrency with SRÂ 125 (Waterloo Highway). The two highways head northeast over the Alapaha River, pass Burton Lake, Oak Grove Cemetery, and Brown Lake, before traveling through Irwinville. At Hogan Lake, SRÂ 32 departs to the southeast and enters Ocilla. In the western part of the city, it intersects USÂ 319/SRÂ 35. The three highways travel concurrently into the main part of the city. They have an intersection with USÂ 129/SRÂ 11/SRÂ 90 (Irwin Avenue). At this intersection, SRÂ 35 reaches its northern terminus, while USÂ 319 turns left onto USÂ 129/SRÂ 11/SRÂ 90, and SRÂ 32 continues to the east. Along its routing, it crosses over the Willacoochee River, curves to the east-southeast, and enters Coffee County. South-southwest of Ambrose, the highway has an intersection with both the northern terminus of SRÂ 149 and the southern terminus of SRÂ 268. SRÂ 32 continues to the southeast, traveling through rural areas of the county and enters Douglas. There, it intersects SRÂ 206 (Bowens Mill Road). Then, it intersects USÂ 441/SRÂ 31 in the main part of the city. Just before leaving Douglas, it intersects USÂ 221/SRÂ 135 (Bowens Mill Road SE). About 3 miles (4.8Â km) later, the highway passes General Coffee State Park and crosses over 17 Mile River. It travels through Nicholls and curves to the northeast into Bacon County. The highway heads northeast and curves to the east to enter Alma. There, it intersects SRÂ 4 Alt. (Dixon Street). A few blocks later, in the main part of town, it intersects USÂ 1/SRÂ 4 (Pierce Street). The highway travels one block north of Rose Hill Cemetery. It travels to the east and curves to the southeast just before intersecting SRÂ 203 in New Lacy. The two highways have a very brief concurrency to the southeast. Continuing southeast, it enters Pierce County. SRÂ 32 travels through Mershon and enters Bristol, where it intersects SRÂ 15/SRÂ 121. Farther to the southeast, in Patterson, is an intersection with USÂ 84/SRÂ 38. The highway crosses over the Little Satilla River into Brantley County. In Hortense, it intersects USÂ 301/SRÂ 23, then proceeds to Needmore, where it meets the northern terminus of SRÂ 110. It curves to the southeast and enters Glynn County. In Anguilla, it begins a concurrency with SRÂ 99. The two highways curve to the northeast, curve back to the east, and enter Sterling. There, they intersect USÂ 25/USÂ 341/SRÂ 27. At this intersection, SRÂ 32 meets its eastern terminus, while SRÂ 99 continues to the east.

<p>SRÂ 32 was established at leas as early as 1919 from SRÂ 1 in Cuthbert east-southeast to Dawson, southeast to Albany, east-southeast to Sylvester, northeast to Ashburn, east-southeast to the approximate location of Nicholls, and east-northeast to SRÂ 15 in Alma. By the end of September 1921, the western terminus was truncated to SRÂ 7 in Sycamore. The former path of SRÂ 32 from Cuthbert to Sylvester was redesignated as SRÂ 50. SRÂ 32 was established on a segment from SRÂ 27 in Baxley east-northeast and north-northwest to SRÂ 23 in the southeastern part of Reidsville, with the Almaâ€“Baxley segment in-between proposed. By October 1926, USÂ 41 was designated on SRÂ 7 in Sycamore. USÂ 1 was designated on SRÂ 32 on the then-completed Almaâ€“Baxley segment. By October 1929, the eastern terminus of SRÂ 32 was truncated to USÂ 1/SRÂ 4 in Alma.

<p>In February 1934, the eastern terminus of SRÂ 32 was extended east-southeast and southeast to SRÂ 38 in Patterson. In the first quarter of 1937, the eastern terminus was extended again, east-southeast to USÂ 341/SRÂ 27 in Sterling. At the end of 1940, the western terminus was extended north-northwest on USÂ 41/SRÂ 7 to Ashburn and then west-northwest to Dawson. In the second quarter of 1941, the crossing of the Flint River, east of Leesburg, was indicated to have "no bridge or ferry". Between June 1955 and July 1957, this crossing was no longer indicated to have not bridge or ferry. The entire length of SRÂ 32 was paved. In 1993, a western bypass of Leesburg, designated as SRÂ 910, was proposed from USÂ 19/SRÂ 3, where they met SRÂ 32 just south of the city to USÂ 19/SRÂ 3 north-northwest of it. In 1998, SRÂ 3 Byp. was established on the proposed path of SRÂ 910, including the concurrency with SRÂ 32. In 2007, USÂ 19 Byp. was established on the paths of SRÂ 3 Byp. and SRÂ 32 in Leesburg.

<p><b>State RouteÂ 32 Connector</b> (<b>SRÂ 32 Conn.</b>) is a 217-foot-long (66Â m) connector route that exists entirely within the city limits of Sycamore, in the south-central part of Turner County.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>It begins at an intersection with USÂ 41/SRÂ 7 (East Railroad Avenue). It travels in a northeasterly direction until it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with the SRÂ 32 mainline (Jefferson Davis Highway). Due to the format to the intersection of USÂ 41/SRÂ 7 and the SRÂ 32 mainline, SRÂ 32 Conn. is an easier way for drivers to travel from USÂ 41/SRÂ 7 north to SRÂ 32 east and from SRÂ 32 west to USÂ 41/SRÂ 7 south.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Between the beginning of 1950 and the beginning of 1968, SRÂ 32 Conn. was established on its current path.
