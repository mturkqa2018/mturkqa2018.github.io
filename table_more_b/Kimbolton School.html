<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Kimbolton School has had a strong role within the village of Kimbolton since it was founded.  The school is the successor to the village grammar school; although there are references to a school at Kimbolton as early as 1531, the generally accepted date for its foundation is 1600. The school originally occupied buildings within the Churchyard, but moved to new premises in Tilbrook Road in the late 19th century. In 1949 it was renamed from Kimbolton Grammar School to Kimbolton School, and the following year it bought Kimbolton Castle from the Duke of Manchester.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The Senior School is based in the grounds of the Castle, and its Preparatory School is based at the other end of the village, but is connected to the senior school by 'The Duchess's Walk', a tree-lined avenue. The school grounds total over 190 acres (77Â ha).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The School's Latin motto is <i>Spes Durat Avorum</i> (<i>may the hope of our forefathers endure</i>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="List_of_Headmasters">List of Headmasters</span></h2>
<p>The School has a tradition of headmasters serving for a long time. William Ingram (after whom the junior house is now named) was headmaster from 1913â€“47, Cyril Lewis (who oversaw the movement of the school to the Castle and who the School's theatre is named after) from 1947â€“73, David Donaldson (after whom the original Science block is named - it has now been converted and houses geography, textiles and food and nutrition - and who first admitted girls to the school) from 1973â€“87, Roger Peel (after whom the sports hall is named) 1987-2002, and the current headmaster Jonathan Belbin, 2002 onwards.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teaching_Buildings">Teaching Buildings</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Castle">The Castle</span></h3>
<p>The castle was bought by Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, in 1615. His descendants owned the castle for 335 years until it was sold in 1950.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Charles Edward Montagu, the 4th Earl, who was created 1st Duke of Manchester in 1719, had many works of reconstruction carried out between 1690 and 1720. Sir John Vanbrugh and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor redesigned the facades of the castle in a classical style, but with battlements to evoke its history as a castle, the portico was later added by Alessandro Galilei. The Venetian painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini redecorated some of the reconstructed rooms in 1708, including the main staircase, now called the Pellegrini Staircase, and the chapel. Rich gilded furnishings in a Louis XIV-inspired style were commissioned from French upholsterers working in London.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>For a later duke, Robert Adam produced plans for the castle gatehouse and other garden buildings, including an orangery. Only one of these buildings, the gatehouse, was constructed, in around 1764. Mews buildings were added to provide stables, and an avenue of giant sequoias was planted in the 19th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The castle was used by the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War II, and the 10th Duke of Manchester sold the castle to the school in 1950. The furnishings were scattered in sales and some have come to national collections. There is limited public opening during the school holidays and at weekends.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The castle is mostly used for 4th, 5th and 6th form teaching, and social and public events. It is also often used for weddings and other functions and is used as a television/film location from time to time.  Teaching and other activities take place in outlying buildings, including the castle's mews block and newer buildings.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Vanbrugh_Library">The Vanbrugh Library</span></h3>
<p>The Vanbrugh Library at the Senior School holds over 12,000 books, DVDs and periodicals. It also houses a suite of 22 PCs. The award-winning library is modern and popular and well-used. It is open throughout the day for Sixth Form private study, class use and individual research.  At other times, pupils may use the library to study, work on homework or projects, choose resources or relax and read. The school's online library programme encourages pupils to make the most of their library and of the wider world of information through a structured approach to the teaching of information skills.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Regular visits from authors provide workshops for pupils of all ages.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Recent author visits include Sir Terry Pratchett, Alexander McCall Smith, Malcolm Rose, Nicola Morgan, Alan Gibbons, Adisa and Mark Robson.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Houses">Houses</span></h2>
<p>There are around 670 male and female students in the senior school (ages 11 to 18), in four Houses, named after the two founders and two previous teachers at the school: Balyes, Dawsons, Gibbards, and Owens. Until recently, all the boarders were in Dawsons House; they are now allocated to all four senior houses. A second house for boarders, Ingrams, was merged with Dawsons in the 1980s, and was reborn as a separate house for all First Form and Second Form pupils. These move into the senior houses at the start of the Third Form. Ingrams compete in a separate house competition between classes, although they have many of the same events as the senior house competition. There are around 300 pupils in the Preparatory School (ages 4 to 11), in four houses named after the families that owned the castle: Fitzpiers, Montagu, Stafford and Wingfield.
