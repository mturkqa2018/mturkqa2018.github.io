<p>The <b>Royal Malaysia Police</b> (often abbreviated <b>RMP</b>) (Malay: <i lang="ms">Polis Diraja Malaysia (PDRM)</i>), is a (primarily) uniformed federal police force in Malaysia. The force is a centralised organisation. Its headquarters are located at <b>Bukit Aman</b>, Kuala Lumpur. The police force is led by an Inspector-General of Police (IGP) who, as of September 2017, is Tan Sri Dato' Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The constitution, control, employment, recruitment, funding, discipline, duties and powers of the police force are specified and governed by the Police Act 1967. In carrying out its responsibilities, the regular RMP is also assisted by a support group of Extra Police Constables, Police Volunteer Reserves, Auxiliary Police, Police Cadets and a civilian service element.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The RMP constantly co-operates closely with police forces worldwide, including from those six neighbouring countries Malaysia shares a border with: Indonesian National Police, Philippine National Police, Royal Brunei Police Force, Royal Thai Police, Singapore Police Force and Vietnam People's Public Security.

<p>A police force has been in existence in Malaysia since the days of the Malacca Sultanate. Malacca's canonical law created what was essentially a police force in Malaysia in the fifteenth century, through the institution of the <i>Temenggung</i> and <i>Hulubalang</i>, or royal warriors. During the Sultan of Malacca's absence, the <i>Bendahara</i>, or Prime Minister, held absolute authority, with the power to hand out sentences, but it was the <i>Temenggung</i> who acted as the Police Chief or Inspector General of Police. His tasks were to arrest criminals, build jails and implement sentences. Apart from the <i>Temenggung</i>, there were a number of <i>Penghulu</i> or village chiefs who had the duty of detroy their respective villages. Their main tasks included tax collection, law enforcement and preserving village security. These Malacca police systems ended when, on 10 August 1511, a Portuguese fleet led by Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca for the Portuguese crown. Police duties were then largely performed by the Portuguese soldiers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>During the sixteenth century, Malaysia became a cosmopolitan society and the Portuguese government introduced the Kapitan administration. On 14 January 1641, however, the Portuguese lost Malacca to the Dutch Empire, when the Dutch invaded with the help of soldiers from Johor state, at a time when the Portuguese were at war with the Sultanate of Acheh. The Dutch retained the Kapitan system, but when the growing number of Europeans in Malaysia made change necessary, a police force known as the 'Burgher Guard' was established. The Burgher Guard was controlled by the Dutch, but their subordinates were made up of the local citizens. Village leaders continued to assume the duties of policemen under Dutch rule, as they had since before the Portuguese arrived.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Following the assimilation of Malacca into the British Empire in 1795, a modern police organisation in Malaysia was formed, on 25 March 1807, after the Charter of Justice in Penang was granted. Most of the officers were of British origin. Later, this organisation was developed in the Straits Settlements and other Malay states, particularly the Federated Malay States. At that time, independent police forces were established for each respective state. Only after World War II was a central police organisation formed, known as the Civil Affairs Police Force. This organisation was formed in Malaya and led by a British colonial, H.B. Longworthy, who had to stabilise the police forces after the anarchy of Japanese occupation. One of the immediate problems faced by the police at this time was the rebellion of the communist party. During the confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia, which lasted from 1963 to 1965, the police force, along with military forces, fought against the infiltration of Indonesian forces into the states of Johor and Sabah.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Almost a year after Independence Day, on 24 July 1958, the King of Malaysia, Tuanku Abdul Rahman Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhamad, bestowed the title <i>Royal</i> to the Malayan Federations Police Force. In 1963, the Royal Federation of Malayan Police (RFMP), the North Borneo Armed Constabulary and the Sarawak Constabulary were merged to form the Royal Malaysia Police. The Singapore Police Force became a component unit of the RMP until Singapore's independence in 1965.

<p>The flag and insignia of the Royal Malaysia Police has a blue coloured background which symbolises the Malaysian masses. In the centre of the flag is the PDRM symbol coloured silver or white. The police symbol is made up of an intersected Kris and Ilang / Klewang machete. Above the PDRM symbol, there is a tiger head in a garland of Paddy flowers, with a scroll underneath bearing the name Polis Diraja Malaysia. Arabic lettering in the Crown includes the words Allah on the right and Muhammad on the left.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crown">Crown</span></h3>
<p>The crown, depicted on the Royal Malaysia Police insignia, is a panegyric reference to the King of Malaysia, bestowing the "Royal" title to its name. The words <b>Allah</b> and <b>Muhammad</b> in Arabic, which respectively symbolise Allah the Almighty and Muhammad as the Messenger, signifies Islam as the official religion and faith of RMP personnel, who are willing to uphold justice and the security of the people of Malaysia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kris_and_the_Ilang_sword">Kris and the Ilang sword</span></h3>
<p>The Kris is an important symbol of the Malay Peninsular. This particular weapon was used by Malay warriors in the past. According to Frey (2003), who concluded from Sir Stamford Raffles' (1817) study of the Candi Sukuh, the kris came into existence around AD 1361. Others believe that early forms were inspired by the daggers of the Dong-Son in Vietnam (circa 300 BC). In the temples of Borobudur (825 CE) and Prambanan (850CE), renderings of the Kris have been found.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The traditional machete, Ilang or Klewang symbolises the states of Sarawak and Sabah in East Malaysia and it represents the spirit of heroism of a multitude of ethnic tribes such as the Dayak, Dusun, Bajau and Kadazan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tiger_head">Tiger head</span></h3>
<p>The tiger head symbolises courage, strength and spirits of RMP. Previously, RMP used a lion head as the symbol of courage from 16 September 1963, after the formation of Malaysia, until 15 May 1994, when it was replaced with the tiger head by an official order of Malaysian government. The former lion head also symbolised the states of Singapore (until 1965) and Sabah.

<p>The Police Field Force (PFF), organised in battalions, was once the para-military units of the Royal Malaysia Police. The force, which was also known as the Jungle Squad (<i>Pasukan Polis Hutan</i> (PPH) in Malay) was tasked to operate in the jungle fringes in counter-insurgency roles during the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontations and later Communist guerrilla insurgencies along the Malaysian-Thai border and in the jungles of Sabah and Sarawak. When the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) finally gave up their armed struggle in 1989 and 1990, PFF lost its role. It was reorganised as the General Operations Force (GOF). The GOF has 19 battalions and the 19th Special Battalion is tasked to provide VIP security.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>When established in 1948, the PFF had 19 battalions of which two were made up of indigenous people. These battalions were known as Senoi Praaq Battalions. One battalion was a Special Security Battalion.

<p>The 19 battalions are organised into five brigades, each headed by a Superintendent of Police. The North Brigade and Sabah Brigade have four battalions each, the Central Brigade has five battalions, and South-East Brigade and Sarawak Brigade have three battalions each.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>It all began in the year 1948, when Malayan Communist Party murdered three European farmers at Sungai Siput, Perak and also murdered the three leaders of Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party).  Sir Edward Gent declared an emergency on 7 July 1948 in all Malaya Federations, starting with Perak on 16 June 1948 and Johore on 19 June 1948. To deal with the rebellion and to hunt down the Communist terrorists in the jungle, a military based team was formed in 1948.  It was named the Flying Squad and later renamed the Jungle Squad, with its main mission to fight against the Communists. The first Jungle Squad unit was established at Sik, Kedah in 1949. Training centres were opened in Sungai Buluh, Selangor and in Dusun Tua, Hulu Langat, Selangor which was known as Field Force Special Training Centre (SLPPH). In 1964, SLPPH was transferred to Kroh, Perak then changed to Kentonmen, Ulu Kinta, Perak. After being renamed the General Operations Force or <i>Pasukan Gerakan Am</i> in 1997, SLPPH is now known as <i>Sekolah Latihan Pasukan Gerakan Am</i> (General Operations Force Training Centre, SLPGA).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>So far, there are two Senoi Praaq battalions specialising in search and rescue operations. After VAT 69 was absorbed into Pasukan Gerakan Khas, along with anti-terrorist police force and Special Action Unit (UTK – Unit Tindakan Khas), a special platoon of PGA, Tiger Platoon was established.

<p>Pasukan Gerakan Khas is a major elite force in the Royal Malaysia Police, which is composed of 69 Commando (VAT 69) and Special Actions Unit (UTK). This team was first merged in 1997 and became known as the Maroon Berets. However, this integration did not last and in 2003 it was separated. The VAT 69 changed to the Sandy Brown Berets, honoured by British 22nd Special Air Service (SAS). However, both units serve under the Pasukan Gerakan Khas and are under the command of a Senior Assistant Commissioner II.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>This special counter-terrorism police team is also involved in some operations within Malaysia, including military operations with Malaysian Army 22nd Commando Regiment Grup Gerak Khas against the Al-Ma'unah organisation formed in Bukit Jenalik, Sauk, Perak. This team also served under the United Nations in Timor Leste and in the search and rescue operation of 700 officers and members of Indonesian National Police BRIMOB (Brigade Mobil) that were lost and trapped during the tsunami incident in Aceh, Indonesia at the end of 2005. This team also cooperated with Criminal Investigation Division to fight against dangerous crimes, among where the PGK successfully tracked down the notorious 'Gang M16' which comprised several ethnic Chinese criminals, including the group leader who was an ex-serviceman of Singapore, and the leader Gang 13 (Mat Komando), as well as other operations. The motto of VAT 69 is WARISAN DARAH PERWIRA (Literal meaning: <i>INHERITANCE OF THE BLOOD OF WARRIORS</i>), while for the UTK it is TANGKAS BANTERAS GANAS (Literal meaning: <i>QUICK TO OVERCOME TERROR</i>).

<p>Unit Gempur Marin (UNGERIN) (<i>Marine Combat Unit</i>) was established in 2006 and it was fully operational by the end of 2007 with the first name as the <i>Unit Selam Tempur</i> due to the pressing need to suppress the pirate attacks alongside the coastal area of Malacca Straits and open sea area of South China Sea which were continuously widespread from time to time despite various efforts done to overcome the problem. The members received special training from the United States after realising the need to form a special unit to secure the national waters and riverine fronts from any untoward incidents. This unit is placed under formation Marine Police Branch which is based in the Marine Police Base at Kampung Aceh, Sitiawan, Perak and Lahad Datu, Sabah. It has a big role in handling threats from pirates, robbery, kidnapping and hijacking of ships and terrorist attacks in national waters.

For the unit's restructuring, the name of UST was changed to <i><b>Unit Gempur Marin</b></i> or <i><b>UNGERIN</b></i> in the year 2008. Its eventual goal is to have 200 operators on standby with UNGERIN.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>In the first phase, the 30-personnel strong special force is to undergo training in Langkawi and Kota Kinabalu, by instructors from Navy SEALs.

<p>Traffic problems in Malaysia began in the late 1920s when motorised vehicles began to hover on the road that used to be covered only by bicycle, tricycle, rickshaw and bullock carts. This situation creates a new task for the police forces, which is to maintain and control the traffic. In 1928 and 1929, the traffic branch was established in big cities, which is Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Seremban. Singapore, which at that time was part of Strait States have set up traffic branch earlier, which is in 1918. In other cities, the task of controlling the traffic falls on regular general duty policemen.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>Because of the increasingly serious traffic problems due to the addition of vehicles, the traffic branch was set up in each state and other big cities gradually. In 1976, the central traffic branch was set up at the Bukit Aman. It is responsible for reviewing, designing and conducting research on traffic branch enforcement, training, engineering, records management and traffic law.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: 2013 Lahad Datu standoff</div>
<p>Following the Sulu militants intrusion, a military standoff commenced on 11 February 2013 and ended after conflict about 24 March 2013. 235 militants, most of whom were armed, arrived by boat in Lahad Datu district from Philippines territory and occupied the village of Tanduo. They were sent by Jamalul Kiram III, a claimant to the throne of the Sultanate of Sulu. His stated goal was to assert the Philippine territorial claim to eastern Sabah as part of the North Borneo dispute. In response, Malaysian security forces surrounded the village. Attempts by the Malaysian and the Philippine governments to reach a peaceful solution with Kiram's supporters were unsuccessful and the standoff escalated into an armed conflict on 1 March 2013. At the end of the standoff, around 56 militants were killed along with six civilians and 10 Malaysian security forces (of which eight were Malaysian police members). The rest of the militants were either captured or escaped back to the Philippines.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shooting_of_Aminulrasyid_Amzah">Shooting of Aminulrasyid Amzah</span></h3>
<p>A schoolboy, Aminulrasyid Amzah, was shot dead by police after allegedly trying to escape from a car accident which he was involved in. Aminulrasyid was driving his sister's car without a valid driver's licence after midnight on 3 May 2010, together with his friend, Azamuddin, who was the passenger. He had been trying to flee a number of motorcyclists who were chasing both boys after their vehicle had sideswiped a car earlier that night. After Aminulrasyid was shot, his friend Azamuddin was assaulted and beaten by the police but managed to escape. The IGP and the police have made many statements to the press saying that Aminulrasyid was trying to ram a police roadblock as well as carrying a weapon in the car. Azamuddin and Aminulrasyid's family has refuted many of the police claims. Many members of the public and the opposing politicians have criticised the police's response, alluding to the fact that the police are trying to cover up the incident and fabricate evidence. The boy's family has rejected calls for an inquest into the shooting because they did not believe they would receive a fair and transparent investigation, especially from the police. Instead, they have called on the government to establish a royal commission of inquiry to investigate Aminulrasyid's death. A special eight-member panel has been formed to scrutinise the investigation of the shooting; however, opposing politicians and the boy's family have derided the formation of the panel as a publicity stunt by the government. On 24 March 2016, the High Court in Selangor awarded more than MYR400,000 in damages to the family of the victim to alleviate their pain and suffering.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recapture_of_Mas_Selamat_Kastari">Recapture of Mas Selamat Kastari</span></h3>
<p>The escaped terrorist, Mas Selamat Kastari, who escaped detention in Singapore in 2008, was nabbed by Bukit Aman and Johore Police while he was asleep in a secluded village house in Skudai, 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Johor Bahru, Johore. He found a traditional kampung house on stilts in Kampung Tawakal, a tiny village with a population of less than 100. Located about 10 km away from the North-South Expressway near the Kempas exit, it is almost impossible to locate for those not familiar with the area. The Singaporean terrorist, who captured world attention when he escaped from the republic's maximum security Whitley Detention Centre in February last year, could barely put up a fight in his shorts and T-shirt when caught during a dawn raid in April. At 6 am, about 30 armed policemen surrounded the kampung house and ordered Mas Selamat to come out. Police broke through two doors and rushed in when he refused to surrender. He was arrested together with two others, Abdul Matin and Johar Hassan, by a PGK and police Special Branch officers following intelligence sharing with the police forces of Indonesia and Singapore. Police also seized documents and other paraphernalia that allegedly revealed their planned operation. This report was later confirmed by both the Singapore and Malaysian governments, with the date of capture given as 1 April 2009.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">63</span></p><p>The Home Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, and Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan at Putrajaya confirmed Mas Selamat was arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act. Hishammuddin declined to give details since the case is sensitive as it involves intelligence agencies of Singapore and Indonesia, as well as Malaysia. Musa said the arrest was made possible as police in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia had been sharing intelligence reports over the past year. It is learnt that Special Branch officers had been working on various leads since March and upon confirming his whereabouts planned the dawn raid that resulted in his arrest.

<p>Non-governmental organisations continued to press the government to create an Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC). In 2005 a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the police had recommended a wide range of reforms, including the establishment of an IPCMC by May 2006. Draft legislation to establish an IPCMC remained under consideration by the Attorney General at the end of the year. A range of other reform recommendations, including repeal or review of laws allowing for detention without trial or requiring police permits for public assemblies, were not implemented.
