<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life_and_education">Early life and education</span></h2>
<p>Chernin was born in Harrison, New York, the son of Mary (née Townsend) and Herbert Chernin. Chernin, whose father was Jewish, was raised Unitarian.  He earned a B.A. in English literature from the University of California, Berkeley.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<p>Widely considered one of the most powerful media executives in the world, Chernin joined Fox in 1989 from Lorimar Film Entertainment, where he served as president and chief operating officer. Earlier, he served as executive vice president of programming and marketing for Showtime/The Movie Channel. Prior to Showtime, Chernin was vice president of Development and Production at the David Gerber Company. He began his career in publishing, first as associate publicity director of St. Martin's Press and later as an editor for Warner Books.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="News_Corp.">News Corp.</span></h3>
<p>Prior to starting TCG, Chernin served as president and chief operating officer of News Corporation and Chairman and CEO of the Fox Group from 1996-2009. As President and COO of one of the world's largest media companies, he oversaw diversified global operations spanning five continents, including the production and distribution of film and television programming; television, satellite and cable broadcasting and News Corp.'s aggressive expansion into the digital media and internet space.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>During his two decades with News Corporation, Chernin gained a reputation as an executive with a unique mastery of both the creative and corporate sides of the entertainment business. He headed both Twentieth Century Fox Filmed Entertainment and, earlier, the Fox Broadcasting Company. He has also had oversight of Fox's tremendous growth in sports, cable and general entertainment television programming and distribution in the U.S. and internationally.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Under Chernin's leadership, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation produced the two top-grossing movies of all time, <i>Titanic</i> and <i>Avatar</i>; the Fox Broadcasting Company became the No. 1-ranked network among the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds; and Twentieth Century Fox Television, the network production arm of Fox, became the No. 1 supplier of programming to all television networks.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>News Corporation's cable network group experienced explosive growth during Chernin's tenure – going from zero to more than 400 million cable subscribers in less than 10 years. Today, Fox has one of the most powerful collections of cable assets in the world: Fox News Channel, FX, Fox Sports Net, Fox Movie Channel, National Geographic Television, SPEED and the Fox Reality Channel. Prior to his 1996 appointment, Chernin served four years as chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Filmed Entertainment where he oversaw all aspects of the studio's worldwide feature-film production, marketing and distribution activities. From 1989 to 1992, Chernin was president of entertainment for the Fox Broadcasting Company, while programming grew from two to seven nights a week during that span.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>It was rumored in the media that Chernin was going to leave his position at News Corp. by June 2009, when his contract expired, and that he would be replaced in the position by media executive James Murdoch, youngest son of Rupert Murdoch. On February 24, 2009, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported that Peter Chernin made the decision to leave News Corporation after 20 years, to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. On June 4, 2009 Chase Carey was named Chernin's successor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Chernin was approached in October 2010 by the Tribune Company to be either CEO or chairman of the board. There was also media speculation about Chernin's having a role in Yahoo!'s future after Carol Bartz's abrupt departure in September 2011. At the 
All Things Digital's AsiaD Conference
in Hong Kong on October 20, 2011, Chernin dismissed that he was interested in pursuing opportunities with the company.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>

In July 2011, CA Media invested in the Hong Kong-based mixed martial arts promoter Legend Fighting Championship. In April 2012, CA Media acquired a 49 percent stake in Endemol India with the goal of making it the leading TV, film and digital content production company in India. At the same time CA Media also invested in Only Much Louder, a 
music, live events and youth media company in India. In April 2014, AT&amp;T partnered with The Chernin Group to invest $500 million in online video services.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In April 2012, Chernin sold a minority stake of TCG to strategic investment partners Providence Equity Partners, a leading private equity firm, and other private investors.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In April 2013, Chernin made a bid of around $500 million for Hulu, an online video streaming service.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>TCG is listed as an investor in Tumblr, which WSJ.com reported on May 19, 2013 would be sold to Yahoo for US$1.1 Billion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>On December 2, 2013, TCG announced that they had acquired the anime streaming site Crunchyroll in an effort to expand their online video assets. The acquisition was rumoured to priced at around $100 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>On January 7, 2016 it was announced by David Portnoy in a video that Chernin Media was acquiring a majority stake in the popular website Barstool Sports and moving the headquarters to New York City.
