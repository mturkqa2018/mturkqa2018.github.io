He was also one of the most successful military commanders in Vietnam's history, though he was known to have attained these achievements by ruthless, massive killing of especially the entire Nguy·ªÖn lords families. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá and his brothers, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c and Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ, together known as the T√¢y S∆°n brothers, were the leaders of the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>According to multiple sources, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá's ancestors were peasants who lived in Ngh·ªá An.  They left Ngh·ªá An and moved to southern Vietnam after an attack by the Nguy·ªÖn lords against the Tr·ªãnh lords in Ngh·ªá An. His ancestors' surname was H·ªì (ËÉ°), but Hu·ªá's great grandfather H·ªì Phi Long, who was a servant of the Dinh family of B·∫±ng Ch√¢n hamlet, Tuy Vi·ªÖn district (or An Nh∆°n), Quy Nh∆°n province, married a woman from the Dinh family and had a son named H·ªì Phi Ti·ªÖn, Hu·ªá's grandfather.  H·ªì Phi Ti·ªÖn did not continue farming as his father, but instead traded in betel. Through his work he met and married Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã ƒ·ªìng (ÈòÆÊ∞‰ª), the only daughter of a rich betel tradesman residing in T√¢y S∆°n village.  One of their children was Hu·ªá's father H·ªì Phi Ph√∫c (ËÉ°‰∏ïÁ¶, also known as Nguy·ªÖn Phi Ph√∫c). Some sources say that in taking on the surname Nguy·ªÖn, the family followed the surname of Hu·ªá's mother; other sources say that it followed the surname of Nguy·ªÖn lords of southern Vietnam.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá was born in 1753 in T√¢y S∆°n village, Quy Nh∆°n Province (now B√¨nh ƒ·ªãnh Province). His father had eight children; later, three of them took part in the T√¢y S∆°n Rebellion. According to <i>ƒ·∫°i Nam ch√≠nh bi√™n li·ªát truy·ªán</i>, the T√¢y S∆°n brothers, listed from eldest to youngest, were Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c, Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. However, other source reported that Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ was the youngest one. His birth name was <b>H·ªì Th∆°m</b>, he also had a nick name <i>ƒ·ª©c √¥ng T√°m</i> (Sir Eighth the virtue).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p><i>ƒ·∫°i Nam ch√≠nh bi√™n li·ªát truy·ªán</i> described Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá as "a cunning man, good at fighting; he has bright penetrating eyes, and always speak in a stentorian voice, everyone fears him." His father, Nguy·ªÖn Phi Ph√∫c, made the three brothers dedicate themselves to their studies early in life. Their martial arts master was Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Hi·∫øn, a retainer (<i>m√¥n kh√°ch</i>) and friend of Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn H·∫°nh (ÂºµÊñáÂπ∏), who in turn was the teacher of Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Lu√¢n, the father of Nguy·ªÖn √nh. After Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn H·∫°nh killed by the powerful chancellor Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan, Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Hi·∫øn fled to B√¨nh ƒ·ªãnh. He was first man to discover the talents of the T√¢y S∆°n brothers and to advise them to do great deeds. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Later, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c became a tax-collector of Nguy·ªÖn lord. However, he robbed off all tax he had collected, and distributed to poor farmers. Nh·∫°c had to flee with his brothers, and became an outlaw. Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Hi·∫øn encouraged Nh·∫°c to revolt against Nguy·ªÖn lords: "The prophecy says: 'Revolt in the West, success in the North'. You are born in T√¢y S∆°n District, you must do your best." Nh·∫°c agreed with him.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Seeking to overthrow the corrupted Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan and to help the prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng, the eldest of the T√¢y S∆°n Brothers, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c, gathered an army and revolted in 1771. He was aided by his brothers Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá and Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ. In the early days of the rebellion, Hu·ªá was the most helpful of Nh·∫°c's generals both in finance and in training the army; with the encouragement of Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Hi·∫øn and his own talent, Hu·ªá rapidly increased his own popularity and that of the T√¢y S∆°n Rebellion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Due to its popularity, the T√¢y S∆°n army grew strong and attracted many talented generals, including Nguy·ªÖn Thung, B√πi Th·ªã Xu√¢n, V√µ VƒÉn D≈©ng, V√µ ƒ√¨nh T√∫, Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu, Tr∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ Ng·ªc, and V√µ Xu√¢n Ho√†i.

<p>After 200 years of holding power in southern Vietnam, the government of the Nguy·ªÖn Lords had become progressively weaker, due to its poor leadership and internal conflicts.  Following the death of Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Kho√°t, the powerful official Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan began to arrogate to himself control over the Nguy·ªÖn government. For the purpose of resisting against the excessive power of Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan and coming to the assistance of Prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng, the T√¢y S∆°n Brothers gathered an army and revolted against the government of the Nguy·ªÖn Lords. The rebel army of the T√¢y S∆°n quickly occupied the central part of Nguy·ªÖn's territory covering from Quy Nh∆°n to B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, thereby weakening the authority of the Nguy·ªÖn government.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 1774, the government of the Nguy·ªÖn lords sent a large army led by general T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp against the T√¢y S∆°n rebels. From Gia ƒ·ªãnh, the troops marched to northern central Vietnam, and after several battles they recaptured B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, Di√™n Kh√°nh, and B√¨nh Khang (modern Ninh H√≤a). The rebel army of the T√¢y S∆°n now only held the land from Ph√∫ Y√™n to Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Also in 1774, the ruler of northern Vietnam, Tr·ªãnh S√¢m, sent a massive army of 30,000 soldiers led by general Ho√†ng Ng≈© Ph√∫c southwards with the same purpose as that of the T√¢y S∆°n rebel army, namely to help the Nguy·ªÖn Lords fight Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan. The northern troops were unobstructed in their march to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, the governmental capital of the Nguy·ªÖn Lords.  The government of the Nguy·ªÖn Lords feared the beginning of an unmanageable war on two fronts.  Officials of the government arrested Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan and gave him up to the troops of the Tr·ªãnh Lords. The Tr·ªãnh lords, however, continued attacking Ph√∫ Xu√¢n under the pretext of helping the Nguy·ªÖn Lords suppress the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion. The Nguy·ªÖn Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn and his officials initially attempted to resist the attack, but ended up fleeing to Qu·∫£ng Nam.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c led an army (with naval support from Chinese pirates) against Nguy·ªÖn lords. Once again, the Nguy·ªÖn Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn fled, this time by sea to Gia Dinh, accompanied by Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √nh, and leaving behind his nephew Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng.  Early in 1775, the army of the Tr·ªãnh Lords marched on Qu·∫£ng Nam at the same time as the T√¢y S∆°n troops reached Qu·∫£ng Nam. T√¢y S∆°n troops searched for and then captured Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng. The army of the Tr·ªãnh Lords crossed the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass, engaged the T√¢y S∆°n troops, and defeated them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>At the same time, the general of the Nguy·ªÖn lords T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp (ÂÆãÁ¶Ê¥Ω) led his troops against Ph√∫ Y√™n, forcing the T√¢y S∆°n army to withdraw.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Fearing a war on two fronts, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c sent Ho√†ng Ng≈© Ph√∫c a proposal that if the Tr·ªãnh lords recognized the T√¢y S∆°n Rebel Army, the T√¢y S∆°n would help the Tr·ªãnh lords fight against the Nguy·ªÖn Lords. The proposal was accepted, and Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c was made an official of the Tr·ªãnh lords.  Nhac also made peace with the Nguy·ªÖn lords, causing T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp to take off the pressure, and deluded Prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng. His diplomacy provisionally made T√¢y S∆°n's enemies inactive and bought him valuable time to shore up his army.

<p>Realising that the provisional truce would not last long, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c retrained the rebel army, recruited new soldiers, fortified ƒ·ªì B√†n castle, and built new bases, preparing for an attack.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp, who had been deceived by Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c peaceful overtures, did not pay much attention to Nh·∫°c's activities. He did not prepare for either defending or attacking. Nh·∫°c made use of Hi·ªáp's inactivity, and sent troops led by his brother Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá against him.  The T√¢y S∆°n troops swiftly defeated the unprepared troops of the Nguy·ªÖn Lords and inflicted heavy losses upon them. T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp and his troops fled to Van Phong. It was the first great victory achieved by Hu·ªá. Nh·∫°c sent news of the victory to Ho√†ng Ng≈© Ph√∫c. On Ph√∫c's request, the Trinh rewarded Nh·∫°c with a new office.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Because the troops of the Tr·ªãnh Lords lacked familiarity with the southern country, Ho√†ng Ng≈© Ph√∫c withdrew the troops to the north.  En route, he died of natural causes. Ph√∫c's death marked the end of the Tr·ªãnh Lords' interventions in the south.  While the army of the Tr·ªãnh Lords withdrew to Thu·∫≠n H√≥a, T√¢y S∆°n moved quickly in sending its troops to take over the abandoned territory and to suppress elements loyal to the Nguy·ªÖn Lords.

<p>Having gained a lot of new rich land without facing much opposition, the T√¢y S∆°n army grew stronger. Nh·∫°c had a desire to expand T√¢y S∆°n's authority. He sent a large army led by his youngest brother Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ to launch a sudden attack against Gia ƒ·ªãnh (now called Ho Chi Minh City) by sea. L·ªØ's raid was successful: he occupied Saigon and forced the Nguy·ªÖn Lord and his followers to flee to Bi√™n H√≤a. His success was short-lived, however, when an army loyal to the Nguy·ªÖn Lords and led by a man named ƒ·ªó Thanh Nh∆°n rose against him in ƒ√¥ng S∆°n. The loyalist army attacked and forced T√¢y S∆°n's troops to withdraw from Saigon. Before withdrawing, L·ªØ seized the local foodstores and took them back to Quy Nh∆°n.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c, due to his power, repaired to Citadel ƒ·ªì B√†n (Vijaya) and in 1776 proclaimed himself King of T√¢y S∆°n (Vietnamese: <i lang="vi">T√¢y S∆°n V∆∞∆°ng</i>), choosing ƒ·ªì B√†n as his capital. He gave Hu·ªá the title <i>Ph·ª• Ch√≠nh</i> (Vice National Administrator). 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In 1777, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá and Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ led an army marched further south. They captured Saigon, destroyed Nguy·ªÖn lords' army successfully. Most members of Nguy·ªÖn royal family killed or executed in this campaign, except Nguy·ªÖn √nh. √nh fled to R·∫°ch Gi√° then to H√† Ti√™n. Finally, √nh fled to Pulo Panjang together with a French priest Pigneau de Behaine. After the battle, Hu·ªá and L·ªØ returned to Quy Nh∆°n, only a small army was left in Gia ƒ·ªãnh. Nguy·ªÖn √nh returned and occupied Gia ƒ·ªãnh in the next year. With the help of de Behaine, √nh made Western weapons, recruited Western adventurers, proclaiming the restoration of Nguy·ªÖn lords' regime. In 1782, a T√¢y S∆°n army under Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá reoccupied Gia ƒ·ªãnh. Nguy·ªÖn √nh had to flee to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc.

<p>In Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc, Nguy·ªÖn supporters suffered from T√¢y S∆°n's frequent attack; what was worse, they were lack of food and drinking water. Ch√¢u VƒÉn Ti·∫øp was sent to Bangkok to request for aid. In 1783, Nguy·ªÖn √nh and his supporters retreated to Siam with Siamese army. In Bangkok, √nh was warmly welcomed by king Rama I. Rama I promised that Siamese would help Nguy·ªÖn √nh to retake his lost kingdom.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Siamese army moved towards southern Vietnam in 1784. A fleet with five thousand men under Chao Fa Krom Luang Thepharirak was dispatched to attack and recapture Saigon for Nguy·ªÖn √nh. √nh and his supporters were also allowed to accompany with the Siamese army. Phraya Wichinarong led Siamese infantry marched to Cambodia, and manoeuvred the Cambodian army. The Cambodian regent, Chaophraya Aphaiphubet (Baen), recruited five thousand soldiers to accompany with Siamese troops.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Siamese troops defeated T√¢y S∆°n army and captured several places including R·∫°ch Gi√°, Tr·∫•n Giang (C·∫ßn Th∆°), Ba Th·∫Øc (Srok Pra-sak, S√≥c TrƒÉng), Tr√† √în, Sa ƒ√©c, M√¢n Th√≠t (or Mang th√≠t, Man Thi·∫øt), and controlled H√† Ti√™n, An Giang and Vƒ©nh Long. However, they met a stubborn resistance from T√¢y S∆°n army, and could not capture any important places. Realizing unable to repulse the enemy, general Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn ƒa sent ƒ·∫∑ng VƒÉn Tr·∫•n to Quy Nh∆°n for help. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The T√¢y S∆°n reinforcements led by Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá reached Gia ƒ·ªãnh in 1785. Hu·ªá sent an envoy to Siamese army under a banner of truce. Hu·ªá showed fear deliberately, requested Siamese not to support Nguy·ªÖn √nh. It proved that it was an excellent stratagem; Thepharirak was taken in. On the morning of January 20, 1785, Siamese fleet was surrounded in R·∫°ch G·∫ßm River and Xo√†i M√∫t River (near M·ªπ Tho River, in present-day Ti·ªn Giang Province). The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese fleet, all the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed. Thepharirak and Nguy·ªÖn √nh fled back to Bangkok.

<p>Northern Vietnam fell into chaos in 1786. An army under Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá, V≈© VƒÉn Nh·∫≠m and Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ch·ªânh marched north to attack Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. The governor of Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, Ph·∫°m Ng√¥ C·∫ßu, was a venal and superstitious coward, he was at odds with his assistant, Ho√†ng ƒ√¨nh Th·ªÉ. An itinerant Taoist priest came to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, and said to C·∫ßu that he should set up an altar to pray for himself. C·∫ßu was persuaded; he built an altar, ordered his soldiers to serve him day and night, making his soldiers very tired. Take this opportunity, Hu·ªá launched a raid on Tr·ªãnh army. Ho√†ng ƒ√¨nh Th·ªÉ was killed in action. Ph·∫°m Ng√¥ C·∫ßu surrendered to T√¢y S∆°n army.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>After the capture of Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, Ch·ªânh encouraged Hu·ªá to overthrow Tr·ªãnh lord. Hu·ªá took his advice, marched further north without Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c's order. T√¢y S∆°n army easily defeated several Tr·ªãnh troops. When they reached ThƒÉng Long (modern Hanoi), Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£i came to the battlefield to fight against T√¢y S∆°n army. T√¢y S∆°n army attacked war elephants with arquebuses, finally, they captured ThƒÉng Long (modern Hanoi) successfully. Hu·ªá met L√™ Hi·ªÉn T√¥ng in the next day; he said he marched north to overthrow of Tr·ªãnh lords, and did not have any other intentions. Hu·ªá was warmly welcomed by L√™ Hi·ªÉn T√¥ng, and received the position <i>Nguy√™n-so√°i</i> (ÂÖÉÂ∏• "supreme commander") noble title <i>Uy-qu·ªëc-c√¥ng</i> (Â®ÂúãÂÖ¨). He also married L√™ Ng·ªc H√¢n, a daughter of the L√™ Emperor. The old emperor died several days later. L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng was enthroned by Hu·ªá. Although he had not been proclaimed as an Emperor at all, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá was respected by citizens of ThƒÉng Long as the way an Emperor would be treated.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c did not want to take northern Vietnam; he sent an envoy to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n to prevent Hu·ªá from marching north, but Hu·ªá had left. Then he got the message that Hu·ªá had captured ThƒÉng Long, and realized that Hu·ªá was hard to be controlled. Nh·∫°c led 2500 men and marched north to meet with Hu·ªá and the L√™ emperor. In ThƒÉng Long, Nh·∫°c promised that he would not take any territory of L√™ emperor. Then Nh·∫°c retreated from ThƒÉng Long together with Hu·ªá. V≈© VƒÉn Nh·∫≠m disliked Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ch·ªânh, and persuaded Hu·ªá to leave Ch·ªânh in northern Vietnam. Hu·ªá led his army back to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n secretly. Ch·ªânh abandoned all his property, and came to Ngh·ªá An to join T√¢y S∆°n army. Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c did not have the heart to abandon him again; Ch·ªânh was left in Ngh·ªá An together with a T√¢y S∆°n general, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Du·ªá.

<p>In the same year, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c proclaimed himself as <i>Trung ∆∞∆°ng Ho√†ng ƒë·∫ø</i> (‰∏≠Â§ÆÁöáÂ∏ "the Central Emperor"). Hu·ªá received the title <i>B·∫Øc B√¨nh V∆∞∆°ng</i> (ÂåóÂπ≥Áéã "King of Northern Conquering"), the area north to H·∫£i V√¢n was given as his fief. But not long after, he came into conflict with Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c. Nh·∫°c attacked on Hu·ªá at first, a civil war broke out.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>But the military might of Hu·ªá was stronger than Nh·∫°c. Hu·ªá besieged Quy Nh∆°n for several months. The main forces of Gia ƒ·ªãnh was called back to support Nh·∫°c, but was defeated in Ph√∫ Y√™n, its commander ƒ·∫∑ng VƒÉn Ch√¢n surrendered to Hu·ªá. Nh·∫°c climbed onto the city wall, and shouted to Hu·ªá: "How can you use the pot of skin to cook meat like that." In B√¨nh ƒ·ªãnh Province, if hunters seized a prey, they would flay it and use its skin to cook meat. Using this metaphor, Nh·∫°c indicated that brothers should not fight with each other. Hu·ªá was moved to tears, and decided to retreat. Taking the advice of Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn K·ª∑, Hu·ªá decided to reach a peace agreement Nh·∫°c. The two brothers chose B·∫øn B·∫£n as a boundary; the area north to Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i was Hu·ªá's area; the area south to ThƒÉng B√¨nh and ƒi·ªán B√†n belonged to Nh·∫°c. From then on, they ceased fire with each other.

L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng could not control the situation, he asked for assistance from Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ch·ªânh. Though Tr·ªãnh B·ªìng was banished from ThƒÉng Long, Ch·ªânh became the new regent just like Tr·ªãnh lords before. After learning about actions of Ch·ªânh, an army under V≈© VƒÉn Nh·∫≠m was sent by Hu·ªá to attack ThƒÉng Long. Ch·ªânh was swiftly defeated and fled together with L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>Ch·ªânh was found and executed, but Nh·∫≠m could not find L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng.

Hu·ªá led an army marched north, and launched a night raid. S·ªü and L√¢n opened the gate to let them in. Hu·ªá captured Nh·∫≠m and had him executed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Hu·ªá led his army back to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n.

<p>L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng never abandoned his attempt to regain the throne. He hid in B·∫£o L·ªôc Mountain; in there, he had a plan to fight against T√¢y S∆°n. His mother, Empress Dowager M·∫´n, fled to Longzhou, called for help from Qing China in order to restore L√™ dynasty. The Qianlong Emperor of Qing China decided to restore L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng to the throne, though under Qing protection.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Two Chinese armies invaded Vietnam in October of the lunar year <i>M·∫≠u Th√¢n</i> (November, 1788): Liangguang army under Sun Shiyi and Xu Shiheng, as the main force, marched across the South Suppressing Pass (present day Friendship Pass); Yungui army under Wu Dajing, marched across the Horse Pass (<i>Maguan</i>); the two armies aimed to attack ThƒÉng Long directly.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>When Liangguang army reached L·∫°ng S∆°n, Sun announced that there was a very large number of Qing army, in order to threaten T√¢y S∆°n soldiers.

In the next day, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá erected an altar on a hill south of Ph√∫ Xu√¢n and proclaimed himself Emperor Quang Trung, in effect abolishing the L√™ dynasty. After the coronation, he marched north with 60,000 soldiers. He recruited volunteers in Ngh·ªá An Province, now the number of his soldiers reached 100,000.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>Hu·ªá arrived in Tam ƒi·ªáp on Lunar December 20 (January 15, 1789). In there, Hu·ªá gathered together the whole forces, and divided them into five branches: main force led by Hu·ªá, marched north to attack ThƒÉng Long directly; a navy led by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tuy·∫øt (Commander Tuy·∫øt), sailed from L·ª•c ƒ·∫ßu River to attack L√™ supporters in H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng; another navy led by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L·ªôc (Commander L·ªôc), sailed from L·ª•c ƒ·∫ßu River to attack Ph∆∞·ª£ng Nh√£n and L·∫°ng Giang; a cavalry (including war elephants) led by ƒ·∫∑ng Ti·∫øn ƒ√¥ng, marched to attack Cen Yidong in ƒ·ªëng ƒa; another cavalry (including war elephants) led by Nguy·ªÖn TƒÉng Long (Commander Long) marched past S∆°n T√¢y to attack Xu Shiheng in Ng·ªc H·ªìi (a place near Thanh Tr√¨).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Chinese soldiers were preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year festival, and planned to march further south to capture Ph√∫ Xu√¢n on January 6 of the next lunar year (January 31, 1789). As Vietnamese New Year (T·∫øt) was generally celebrated on the same day, Chinese generals assumed that T√¢y S∆°n army would not attack in these days. However, subsequent events proved that they were wrong. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá made a surprise and fast attack against Chinese forces during the New Year holiday. They reached ThƒÉng Long in the night of January 3 of the next lunar year (January 28, 1789). In the fierce 4-day battle, most of Chinese soldiers were unprepared, they were disastrously defeated by the T√¢y S∆°n army in Ng·ªc H·ªìi and ƒ·ªëng ƒa (part of modern Hanoi). Qing generals Xu Shiheng, Shang Weisheng, Zhang Chaolong and Cen Yidong were killed in action. Many Chinese soldiers and porters were killed in action, or drowned while crossing the Red River. According to <i>Draft History of Qing</i>, over half number of Chinese soldiers died in the battle. Sun Shiyi, the commander-in-chief of Chinese army, abandoned his army, fled for his life back to China with several soldiers. L√™ Chi√™u T√¥ng also fled to China. Hu·ªá marched into ThƒÉng Long, his clothes was blackened by gunpowder. T√¢y S∆°n army marched further north after the battle; they reached L·∫°ng S∆°n, and threatened to march across the border to arrest L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng. It made Chinese borderers afraid.

<p>A secret order of Qianlong Emperor was found by T√¢y S∆°n army, and handed to Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. In this order, Qianlong ordered Sun to march slowly, and let L√™ officials come back to Vietnam to find L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng; if T√¢y S∆°n army retreated, that was the best, let L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng take the lead and Chinese army brought up the rear; it not, Qianlong would order Chinese navy to attack Thu·∫≠n H√≥a and Qu·∫£ng Nam, Hu·ªá would surrendered when T√¢y S∆°n dynasty suffering from a double-pronged attack; then ordered Hu·ªá to recognized the dominion of L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng in northern Vietnam, and separated Vietnam into two countries. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá realized that restoration of L√™ dynasty was only an excuse, the true purpose of Qianlong was to control Vietnam. The defeat of Qing army made Qianlong ashamed; if Hu·ªá did not sue for peace, Qing China would invade Vietnam again. But, Chinese records stated that if Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá did not sue for peace, T√¢y S∆°n dynasty would fall in a two-front war with both Qing China and Siam. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá attempted to find a peaceful solution with Qing China; he ordered Ng√¥ Th√¨ Nh·∫≠m to deal with the peace negotiations, then went back to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n.  Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá also showed considerable mercy to the defeated Qing forces, allowing them to return home with honor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>The irate Qianlong Emperor replaced Sun Shiyi with Fuk'anggan, and planned another attack on Vietnam. Fuk'anggan did not want to conflict with Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá; he sent a letter to Hu·ªá and wrote, the prerequisite for cease-fire was Hu·ªá should apologize to the emperor. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá agreed; he changed his name to <b>Nguy·ªÖn Quang B√¨nh</b> (ÈòÆÂÖâÂπ≥), and sent Nguy·ªÖn Quang Hi·ªÉn (ÈòÆÂÖâÈ°Ø) and V≈© Huy T·∫•n (Ê≠¶ËºÁë®) to Beijing. The peace envoy agreed to pay tribute annually, they also promised that Hu·ªá would go himself to have an audience with Qianlong Emperor. Qianlong was happy to hear that; Hu·ªá received the title <i>An Nam qu·ªëc v∆∞∆°ng</i> ("King of Annam") from China. The title indicated that Hu·ªá was recognized as the ruler of Vietnam, and L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng was no longer supported by China.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Actually, Hu·ªá did not want to go to China at all. Fuk'anggan urged him to go to Beijing several times, each time Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá used different excuses to refuse to go. Finally, Fuk'anggan suggested Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá that if Hu·ªá really do not want to go to China, he should "choose a man look like him" as a political decoy. Hu·ªá accepted his idea, and chose Ph·∫°m C√¥ng Tr·ªã as the political decoy; Ng√¥ VƒÉn S·ªü, ƒ·∫∑ng VƒÉn Ch√¢n, Phan Huy √ch, V≈© Huy T·∫•n were sent to accompany with the fake king. All Chinese officials knew the so-called king was fake, but no one exposed the lie.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>The diplomatic envoys reached Beijing, then to Chengde Mountain Resort, to celebrate the eightieth birthday of Qianlong. It made Qianlong very happy; Qianlong granted a lot of gifts to the fake king. Before the envoys returned to Vietnam, Qianlong ordered an imperial artist to draw a portrait of the fake king as a gift.

<p>Once in power, Emperor Quang Trung first began instituting massive and unprecedented national reforms in Vietnam. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>Though Quang Trung entitled as "king of Annam" by Qing China, he always regarded himself as emperor of ƒ·∫°i Vi·ªát. He crowned L√™ Ng·ªc H√¢n empress, and granted her the noble title <i>B·∫Øc Cung ho√†ng h·∫≠u</i> (ÂåóÂÆÆÁöáÂé "empress of Northern Palace"); Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n was designated as Crown Prince.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Taking the advice of Nguy·ªÖn Thi·∫øp, Quang Trung decided to relocate the imperial capital in Ngh·ªá An Province. He ordered Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu to build a new citadel at the foot of K·ª≥ L√¢n Hill (modern Quy·∫øt Hill in Vinh). The new citadel was named <i>Ph∆∞·ª£ng Ho√†ng Trung ƒ√¥</i> (È≥≥Âá∞‰∏≠ÈÉΩ).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>ThƒÉng Long was renamed B·∫Øc Th√†nh (ÂåóÂüé). S∆°n Nam (Â±±Âó) split into two <i>tr·∫•n</i> ("town"): S∆°n Nam Th∆∞·ª£ng (Â±±Âó‰∏ä "Upper S∆°n Nam") and S∆°n Nam H·∫° (Â±±Âó‰∏ã "Lower S∆°n Nam"). Each <i>tr·∫•n</i> had two high officials: <i>Tr·∫•n-th·ªß</i> (ÈéÆÂÆà "viceroy") and <i>Hi·ªáp-tr·∫•n</i> (ÂîÈéÆ "deputy viceroy"). Each <i>huy·ªán</i> ("district") had two officials: <i>ph√¢n-tri</i> (ÂàÜÁü•), the civil official, took charge of judicial litigation; <i>ph√¢n-su·∫•t</i> (ÂàÜÁéá), the military official, took charge of army provisions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>The official system of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty was not mentioned in official records, but we could find several names of official positions in history records, such as <i>tam c√¥ng</i> (‰∏âÂÖ¨), <i>tam thi·∫øu</i> (‰∏âÂ∞ë), <i>ƒ·∫°i-ch·ªßng-t·ªÉ</i> (Â§ßÂÜ¢ÂÆ∞), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t∆∞-ƒë·ªì</i> (Â§ßÂ∏Âæí), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t∆∞-kh·∫•u</i> (Â§ßÂ∏ÂØá), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t∆∞-m√£</i> (Â§ßÂ∏È¶¨), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t∆∞-kh√¥ng</i> (Â§ßÂ∏Á©∫), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t∆∞-c·ªëi</i> (Â§ßÂ∏ÊúÉ), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t∆∞-l·ªá</i> (Â§ßÂ∏Èö∏), <i>Th√°i-√∫y</i> (Â§™Â∞â), <i>ƒ·∫°i-t·ªïng-qu·∫£n</i> (Â§ßÁ∏ΩÁÆ°), <i>ƒ·∫°i-ƒë·ªïng-l√Ω</i> (Â§ßËë£ÁÜ), <i>ƒ·∫°i-ƒë√¥-ƒë·ªëc</i> (Â§ßÈÉΩÁ£), <i>ƒ·∫°i-ƒë√¥-h·ªô</i> (Â§ßÈÉΩË≠∑), <i>Trung-th∆∞-s·∫£nh</i> (‰∏≠Êõ∏Âª≥), <i>Trung-th∆∞-l·ªánh</i> (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§), <i>ƒ·∫°i-h·ªc-sƒ©</i> (Â§ßÂ≠∏Â£´), <i>Hi·ªáp-bi·ªán ƒë·∫°i-h·ªc-sƒ©</i> (ÂîËæ¶Â§ßÂ≠∏Â£´), <i>Th·ªã-trung ng·ª±-s·ª≠</i> (‰æ‰∏≠Âæ°Â≤), <i>L·ª•c-b·ªô th∆∞·ª£ng-th∆∞</i> (ÂÖ≠ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏), <i>T·∫£-h·ªØu ƒë·ªìng-ngh·ªã</i> (Â∑¶Â≥ÂåË≠∞), <i>T·∫£-h·ªØu ph·ª•ng-ngh·ªã</i> (Â∑¶Â≥Â•âË≠∞), <i>Th·ªã-lang</i> (‰æÈÉé), <i>T∆∞-v·ª•</i> (Â∏Âãô), <i>H√†n-l√¢m</i> (Áø∞Êûó), etc.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>The system of military units: a <i>ƒë·∫°o</i> (Èì) was composed of several <i>c∆°</i> (Â•á), a <i>c∆°</i> was composed of several <i>ƒë·ªôi</i> (Èöä). Quang Trung organized the army into five major wings: <i>ti·ªn-qu√¢n</i> ("army of the front"), <i>h·∫≠u-qu√¢n</i> ("army of the rear"), <i>trung-qu√¢n</i> ("army of the center"), <i>t·∫£-qu√¢n</i> ("army of the left"), <i>h·ªØu-qu√¢n</i> ("army of the right"). T√¢y S∆°n army was recruited by enforced conscription. Chose one in three adult males (<i>ƒëinh</i> ‰∏), the chosen one should join the army.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Adult males of the whole country divided into three scales to pay taxes in corv√©e (<i>s∆∞u d·ªãch</i>) and capitation (<i>thu·∫ø th√¢n</i>): <i>v·ªã c·∫≠p c√°ch</i> (Êú™ÂäÊ†º), 2 to 17 years old; <i>tr√°ng h·∫°ng</i> (Â£ØÈ†Ö), 18 to 55 years old; <i>l√£o h·∫°ng</i> (ËÄÈ†Ö); 56 to 60 years old; <i>l√£o nhi√™u</i> (ËÄÈ•í), over 61 years old. Different scales had different tax collection standards.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Farmers should pay a fixed amount of grain as tax. Public owned farmland divided into three scales: the first scale, paid 150 <i>b√°t</i> (Èâ¢, a unit of weight) per <i>m·∫´u</i> (a unit of area); the second scale, 80 <i>b√°t</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i>; the third scale, 50 <i>b√°t</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i>. Private owned farmland also divided into three scales: the first scale, 40 <i>b√°t</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i>; the second scale, 30 <i>b√°t</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i>; the third scale, 20 <i>b√°t</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>There were also two additional taxes of farmland: <i>ti·ªn th·∫≠p-v·∫≠t</i> (Èå¢‰ªÄÁâ©) and <i>ti·ªn kho√°n-kh·ªë</i> (Èå¢Âà∏Â∫´). Public owned farmland: paid 1 <i>ti·ªn</i> (currency unit) per <i>m·∫´u</i> for <i>th·∫≠p-v·∫≠t</i>, 50 <i>ƒë·ªìng</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i> for <i>kho√°n-kh·ªë</i>; private owned farmland: paid 1 <i>ti·ªn</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i> for <i>th·∫≠p-v·∫≠t</i>, 30 <i>ƒë·ªìng</i> per <i>m·∫´u</i> for <i>kho√°n-kh·ªë</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>Quang Trung introduced the identity card system to govern the large population. A census was conducted during his reign. Every adult males was granted <i>t√≠n b√†i</i> (‰ø°Áâå), a wooden card on which has his name, birth place and fingerprints. If anyone did not have the wooden card, he would be arrested and imprisoned with hard labour.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>Quang Trung also replaced the traditional Chinese script with the Vietnamese Ch·ªØ N√¥m as the official written language of the country. Examinees were ordered to write Ch·ªØ N√¥m in imperial examination. Though this policy was criticised at that time, modern scholars stated that it had progressive significance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>A religious reform carried out during his reign. Many small Buddhist monasteries were closed and merged into larger ones. Monks should pass the examination, if not, they would be ordered to return to secular life. Quang Trung also adopted a policy of religious tolerance. His religious toleration won him the support of the growing Christian community and his campaign of the common people against the traditional elites won him the admiration of the peasant majority.

<p>Quang Trung sued for peace and received noble title from Qing China before, but he waited for an opportunity to take revenge on China.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>After the defeat of China, a L√™ prince, L√™ Duy Ch·ªâ (ÈªéÁ∂≠Á•ó), fled to Tuy√™n Quang and Cao B·∫±ng. There, Ch·ªâ was supported by native chieftain N√πng Ph√∫c T·∫•n (ÂÑÇÁ¶Á∏â) and Ho√†ng VƒÉn ƒ·ªìng (ÈªÉÊñáÊ°). Ch·ªâ devised a plan to unite Vientiane and Muang Phuan in a revolt of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty. An army under Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu conquered Muang Phuan and executed their chiefs. Then, the army invaded Kingdom of Vientiane; king Nanthasen fled, T√¢y S∆°n marched west till the border of Siam. The victorious army attacked B·∫£o L·ªôc, captured L√™ Duy Ch·ªâ, N√πng Ph√∫c T·∫•n, Ho√†ng VƒÉn ƒ·ªìng, and had them executed. Horses, elephants and war drums were brought to Vietnam as booty of war, then handed over to Qing China as tribute, Quang Trung did it to show power to China. Quang Trung also requested for exemption from customs duties, and established a <i>y√° h√°ng</i> (ÁâôË°å, broker house in ancient China) in Nanning, they were both agreed by Qianlong Emperor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p><p>There was a territorial dispute near Sino-Vietnamese border. Vietnamese claimed this territory belonged to Tuy√™n Quang Province and H∆∞ng H√≥a Province, but was illegally occupied by native chiefdom of Guangxi in final years of L√™ dynasty. Quang Trung wrote a letter to Fuk'anggan, required him to return this territory. Fuk'anggan rejected, and replied the border had been delimited. Quang Trung was resentful, from then on, he began to train his soldiers and build many large warships, planning to invade Liangguang. It was said that Quang Trung looked down upon Qianlong Emperor. He said to his ministers that if given more time to train soldiers, he was not afraid to conflict with China.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>Quang Trung also provided refuge to anti-Manchuism organization such as Tiandihui. His reign also saw the golden age of South China Coast Pirates (Vietnamese: <i lang="vi">T√†u √î</i>). Powerful Chinese pirates, such as Chen Tien-pao (Èô≥Ê∑ª‰ø), Mo Kuan-fu (Ëé´ËßÄÊâ∂), Liang Wen-keng (Ê¢ÊñáÂ∫ö), Fan Wen-tsai (Ê®äÊñáÊâ), Cheng Chi (ÈÑ≠‰∏É) and Cheng I (ÈÑ≠‰∏Ä), were granted official positions or noble ranks from T√¢y S∆°n dynasty. With the support of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty, the number of Chinese pirates grew rapidly, they were able to block sea routes, and harassed the coastlines of China.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Final_years">Final years</span></h2>
<p>In 1792, Quang Trung decided to invade China. There was evidence that he had the intention to conquer South China and restore B√°ch Vi·ªát Kingdoms. Quang Trung attempted to seek a Chinese princess in marriage, and demanded that Liangguang should be ceded to Vietnam as dowry. He knew Qianlong would not accept his unreasonable demand; he just wanted an excuse of war. But finally, the messager V√µ Chi√™u Vi·ªÖn (Ê≠¶ÊãõÈ†) did not set out because Quang Trung fell ill.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>Quang Trung suddenly fell ill and soon was in danger. The official records did not mention about what disease he got. Some historian stated that his death possibly due to a stroke. Legend had it that he died actually because he was punished by spirits of dead Nguy·ªÖn lords whose tombs he seriously insulted.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>Quang Trung called Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu back to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. He set a schedule to move the capital to <i>Ph∆∞·ª£ng Ho√†ng trung ƒë√¥</i> together with high ministers. At this time, he got the information that Nguy·ªÖn √nh had captured B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, B√¨nh Khang (modern Ninh H√≤a) and Di√™n Kh√°nh. He was depressed, and soon became critically ill. On his deathbed, Quang Trung was worried about the future of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty. He described the Crown Prince Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n as "a clever boy but too young", described Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c as "an old man who is resigned to the present state of affairs". His will instructed that he be buried within a month; all ministers and generals should be united as one to assist the Crown Prince; and move the capital to <i>Ph∆∞·ª£ng Ho√†ng trung ƒë√¥</i> as soon as possible. If not, one day all of them will be killed by Nguy·ªÖn √nh.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">63</span></p><p>Quang Trung was buried on the southern bank of Perfume River. He was buried secretly; Ng√¥ Th√¨ Nh·∫≠m stated that Quang Trung was buried in ƒan D∆∞∆°ng Palace (<i>cung ƒëi·ªán ƒan D∆∞∆°ng</i>). The exact location was not clear; Nguy·ªÖn ƒ·∫Øc Xu√¢n, a culture researcher, believed that it was located at B√¨nh An Village, Hu·∫ø.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p><p>Quang Trung received temple name <i>Th√°i T·ªï</i> (Â§™Á•ñ) and posthumous name <i>V√µ Ho√†ng ƒë·∫ø</i> (Ê≠¶ÁöáÂ∏) from his successor, Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n. Getting the information, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c prepared to attend his funeral, however, the road was blocked by To·∫£n. Nh·∫°c had to return, and sent a sister to attend the funeral.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><p>The plan to invade China was given up. Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n built a fake tomb in Linh ƒ∆∞·ªng (ËãìÂ°ò, a place in modern Thanh Tr√¨ District) for him. Then To·∫£n reported his death to Qianlong Emperor: "I followed my father's will, buried him in Linh ƒ∆∞·ªng instead of his birthland because he was reluctant to leave your palace, and Linh ƒ∆∞·ªng was nearer to your palace." Qianlong praised for Quang Trung, gave him the posthumous name <i>Trung Thu·∫ßn</i> (Âø†Á¥î lit. "loyalty and sincerity"). Qianlong also composed a funeral oration for Quang Trung. In the oration Qianlong wrote: "(You have) blessed (me) and pledged loyalty (to me) in the southernmost, (so I) approved you to attend (my) imperial court; (now you) lie at rest beside the West Lake, (you are) nostalgic for (the good old days in) my palace till death." (Á•ÈáÂóÊ•µÂäπÂø†ÁâπÁéÂÖ∂Ë∂®Êú Â¶•È≠ÑË•øÊπñÊ≤í‰∏ñÁÑ°ÂøòÊñºÊàÄÈóï). The oration was engraved on a stone, and erected beside his fake tomb. A Chinese official was sent to Linh ƒ∆∞·ªng to pay condolences, and granted Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n the title <i>An Nam qu·ªëc v∆∞∆°ng</i> ("King of Annam").

<p>However, Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n (now crowned the Emperor C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh) did not continue the policies of him. The identity card system was abolished, and the capital remained in Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. High ministers and generals struggled for power, which led to the decline of his glory empire. Unfortunately, Quang Trung's prophecy was fulfilled. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>T√¢y S∆°n dynasty was overthrown by Nguy·ªÖn √nh in 1802. Quang Trung's sons: Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n, Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy, Nguy·ªÖn Quang Duy (ÈòÆÂÖâÁ∂≠), Nguy·ªÖn Quang Thi·ªáu (ÈòÆÂÖâÁ¥π) and Nguy·ªÖn Quang B√†n (ÈòÆÂÖâÁõ§), were captured alive; Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy committed suicide; the others were executed by slow slicing, then their bodies were dismembered by having five elephants pull the limbs and head (‰∫îË±°ÂàÜÂ±). The tombs of Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá were razed to the ground, their remains were dug out and crushed into ashes. The skulls of Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá and Hu·ªá's wife, were locked up in prison in perpetuity. It was said that Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá had desecrated the tombs of Nguy·ªÖn lords before, Nguy·ªÖn √nh did that to "revenge for the ancestors".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">68</span></p><p>T√¢y S∆°n dynasty was regarded as an illegal regime during Nguy·ªÖn dynasty; it was mentioned as <i>Ngu·ªµ T√¢y</i> (ÂÉûË•ø "fake T√¢y"), or <i>T√¢y t·∫∑c</i> (Ë•øË≥ä "The rebel T√¢y") in Nguy·ªÖn official records to highlight the supposed illegitimacy of the dynasty.
