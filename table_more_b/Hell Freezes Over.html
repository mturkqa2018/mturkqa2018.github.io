<p><i><b>Hell Freezes Over</b></i> is the second live album by the Eagles, released in 1994. The album is the first to be released after the Eagles had reformed following a fourteen-year-long break up. The band's lineup was that of the <i>Long Run</i> era: Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, and Timothy B. Schmit. It contains four new studio tracks and eleven tracks recorded live in April 1994 for an MTV special. Two Top 40 Mainstream singles, "Get Over It" and "Love Will Keep Us Alive", were released from the album. It also features an acoustic version of "Hotel California". The four new studio recordings are the last to feature Don Felder, who was terminated from the band in 2001.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The album went to No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> album chart upon its release where it stayed for two weeks. The album has sold over 9 million copies in the United States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p><i>Hell Freezes Over</i> was also released in video form on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD. Before the album was released, the Eagles also started a tour, which would last from 1994 to 1996 and became one of the most successful tours in music history.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>The album name is in reference to a quote by Don Henley after the band's breakup in 1980; he commented that the band would play together again "when Hell freezes over". Henley said in 1982 on the break-up: "I just rule out the possibility of putting the Eagles back together for a Lost Youth and Greed tour". In 1993, an Eagles tribute album, <i>Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles</i>, was recorded by several country artists. Travis Tritt, who covered "Take It Easy" in the album, asked the band to appear in his video for the song. The former Eagles band members agreed, and it would be the first time the group had appeared together in 13 years. Two months later, Frey and Henley had lunch with their management and decided to reunite.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The band members performed live for the first time in April 1994 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California for an MTV special. The recording sessions produced 11 tracks for the <i>Hell Freezes Over</i> album, including a new arrangement of "Hotel California" that features an extended acoustic guitar and percussion opening. At the beginning of the concert, Glenn Frey joked to the audience: "For the record, we never broke up; we just took a 14-year vacation". The tour began in May 27 and the <i>Hell Freezes Over</i> album was released on November 8, 1994. The album is the band's second live album, behind their live album in 1980.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The new song "Get Over It" became a modest hit, and another new song, "Love Will Keep Us Alive", reached No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> Adult Contemporary chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The DVD is one of the first music releases to feature a DTS format soundtrack in addition to a PCM stereo soundtrack. The DVD also featured the song "Seven Bridges Road" in DTS audio only. The DVD has since been re-released with an additional Dolby Digital soundtrack. The album has also been released as DTS CD in 1997.
