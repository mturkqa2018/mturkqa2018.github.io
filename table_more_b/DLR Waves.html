<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Founded in 1966, UCD are one of the oldest women's football clubs in the Republic of Ireland. Like the UCD men's team, the women's football team competes in national competitions, such as the FAI Women's Cup and the Women's National League, as well as intervarsity competitions. UCD has also represented the Republic of Ireland in the UEFA Women's Cup.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intervarsity_level">Intervarsity level</span></h3>
<p>According to Professor Meenan's <i>History of UCD Sport</i>, the UCD women's association football team was founded in 1966, playing their first games in 1967, including one against Dublin University. However it was not until the early 1980s that the club began to play regularly. In 1983 and 1984 they finished as runners-up in the LSCAI Intervarsity Cup. In 1991 UCD joined the national colleges league, which was organized by the Ladies Soccer Colleges Association of Ireland (LSCAI) and then by the Women's Soccer Colleges Association of Ireland (WSCAI). The club won its first Colleges Premier Division title in 1994–95 with a 100% record and without conceding a goal all season. The club completed an Intervarsity double after also winning the Intervarsity Cup for the first time. A second Intervarsity double was completed in 1996–97.

<h3><span id="FAI_Women.27s_Cup"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="FAI_Women's_Cup">FAI Women's Cup</span></h3>
<p>UCD entered the FAI Women's Cup for the first time in 2002 and won it on their first attempt after defeating Shamrock Rovers 2–1 in the final. With a team that included Sylvia Gee, Mary Waldron, Caroline Thorpe and Nora Stapleton, UCD retained the cup in 2003 after defeating Lifford Ladies in the final. Carmel Kissane scored both goals in a 2–0 win. Under coach Larry Mahony, UCD completed a three-in-a-row of FAI Women's Cup wins when they defeated Dundalk City 4–1 in the 2004 final. UCD were also finalists in 2006 but they lost 1–0 to the  Mayo Ladies League.
As UCD Waves, the club were also runners up in 2014 and 2017.

<p>In 2002 UCD also began entering a team in the Dublin Women's Soccer League. After finishing as runners up in their debut season, UCD completed a four-in-a-row of DWSL titles between 2003 and 2006.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_seasons">Early seasons</span></h4>
<p>The UCD women's team applied to join the Women's National League for the inaugural 2011–12 season. However their application fell through when the university couldn't guarantee them regular access to UCD Bowl. The men's football team and men's rugby union team were given priority access. During the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013–14 season the majority of UCD women's team and several alumni  played in the WNL for other clubs. Louise Quinn, Dora Gorman, Julie-Ann Russell, Caroline Thorpe and Chloe Mustaki all played for Peamount United  while Siobhán Killeen, Ciara Grant and Mary Waldron played for Raheny United. Nicola Sinnott also  played for Shamrock Rovers  before switching to  Wexford Youths. Meanwhile, Dora Gorman, Julie-Ann Russell, Chloe Mustaki, Siobhán Killeen, Ciara Grant also played for UCD in intervarsity competitions and in 2013–14 they helped UCD win the WSCAI Premier Division and the WSCAI Futsal Cup.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="DLR_Waves">DLR Waves</span></h4>
<p>The 2012–13 season saw DLR Waves join the WNL as an expansion team. The new club was formed with the support of the Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council and they played their home games at Jackson Park, Kilternan. DLR Waves were managed by former UCD coach, Larry Mahony, and their squad featured former UCD captain Sylvia Gee. Initially DLR Waves had mixed success in the WNL. During the 2012–13 season they finished fifth. They were also FAI Women's Cup semi-finalists.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="UCD_Waves">UCD Waves</span></h4>
<p>Before the start of the 2014–15 season it was announced that DLR Waves and UCD would merge. Eileen Gleeson, formerly of Peamount United, was appointed manager of the new team known as UCD Waves. A number of Peamount United players including Julie-Ann Russell, Aine O'Gorman, Karen Duggan, Dora Gorman, Chloe Mustaki and Emily Cahill all subsequently followed Gleeson to UCD Waves  UCD student Ciara Grant also joined from Raheny United.
