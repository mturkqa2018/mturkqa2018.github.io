<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Originally known as the <b>Metro Valley Junior Hockey League</b>, the league was founded in 1967 by Fred McGillivray and Louie Lewis of Halifax, Nova Scotia and Don Stewart of Berwick, Nova Scotia as a Junior "B" level hockey league.  Originally an exclusively Nova Scotia hockey league, it included six teams: East Hants Junior Penguins, Halifax Colonels, Dartmouth Hoyts, Windsor Royals, Kentville Riteways, and Berwick Shell Juniors.  1968 saw the Truro Bearcats and Amherst Ramblers replace the teams from Kentville and Berwick.  In 1971–72 the New Glasgow Bombers and the Pictou Maripacs entered the league. Stellarton and a new Kentville franchise entered the league in 1973 and 1974 respectively.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In 1977, still known as the "Metro Valley", the league entered into the Tier II Junior "A" level.  The jump to Junior "A" was, in theory, to be a catalyst for the development of the league.  However The budgets necessary to play at the Jr. 'A' level resulted in the immediate withdrawal of the Chester Ravens and the East Hants Penguins. The <b>Cole Harbour Colts</b> (Scotia Colts), who entered the league in 1976, became the first team in league history to host the national championship, then known as the Centennial Cup, in 1980.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The 1983 season saw the expansion of the <b>Moncton Midland Hawks</b> of Moncton, New Brunswick, the league's first non-Nova Scotia team.  The Hawks came from the New Brunswick Junior Hockey League and are now known as the Dieppe Commandos.  In 1986, the league expanded to Antigonish and the Scotia Colts, again, hosted the Centennial Cup.  The Summerside Western Capitals of the Island Junior Hockey League, Prince Edward Island's junior hockey league, hosted the 1989 Centennial Cup.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 1991, Summerside and Charlottetown of Prince Edward Island left the IJHL and joined the newly dubbed "Maritime Junior A Hockey League".  The IJHL is still PEI's premier Junior league, but now is only a Junior "B" league.  The winner of the IJHL's playoffs compete for the Don Johnson Cup, the Maritime Junior "B" Championship.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>For the 1996-97 season, the league added the Cape Breton Islanders and Restigouche River Rats. In 1996–97 the league consisted of the Amherst Ramblers, Antigonish Bulldogs, Charlottetown Abbies, East Hants Penguins, Dartmouth Oland Exports, Moncton Gagnon Beavers, Saint John Alpines, and Summerside Western Capitals. The Saint John Alpines folded in January.  With financial losses totalling $40,000 and an additional $50,000 shortfall projected should the team finish the season, they simply ran out of money. The Summerside Western Capitals won the league's first ever national title. The Capitals hosted the Royal Bank Cup at Cahill Stadium and won the championship game 4–3 over the South Surrey Eagles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Truro and Bathurst received approval for new teams to start in 1997-98 but due to the relocation of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Laval Titan to Bathurst, the Truro Bearcats would be the sole new team. The Cape Breton Islanders moved to Glace Bay and became the Glace Bay Miners, but with the arrival of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, they folded in December of that season, leaving the league with nine teams again.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>
During the 1998–99 season two teams changed their names. The first was the Dartmouth Oland Exports when they moved to the Halifax Forum to become the Halifax Oland Exports. The second was the 1998–99 MJAHL champions, the Restigouche River Rats, as they changed their name to the Campbellton Tigers.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="187" data-file-width="306" decoding="async" height="122" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Old_MJAHL.jpg/200px-Old_MJAHL.jpg" srcset width="200"/> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div><div style='border: 3px solid red'><center><h1 style='color:red'>1</h1></center></div>Old Logo</div></div></div>
<p>A 10th team was added for the 2000–2001 season, the Miramichi Timberwolves. At the same time, the East Hants Penguins moved to Dartmouth and became the Scotia Dairy Queen Blizzard. At the end of the 2001–02 season, the league approved the transfer of the Blizzard to Yarmouth. The Yarmouth Motormart Mariners began play in September 2002. In early 2003 the league governors approved expansion into Woodstock, N.B., with the Slammers beginning play in the 2003–04 season.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The league hired its first professional full-time league president in 2003, Vernon Doyle.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The league got their second national Championship when the <b>Halifax Oland Exports</b> won the 2002 Royal Bank Cup on home ice. One year later, after financial trouble with Oland Brewery, the franchise's name was changed to Halifax Team Pepsi. In the spring of 2004, the Weeks Hockey Organization bought the club, moved it to New Glasgow and renamed it the Pictou County Weeks Crushers. On that same day Halifax was granted an expansion franchise, the Halifax Wolverines.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In the spring of 2008, the MJAHL had some big changes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>On April 15, the Antigonish Bulldogs announced that they were applying for a leave of absence for one year. On April 26, the Bulldogs had to choose between two groups trying to buy the team and relocate it. The first group would move the franchise to New Richmond, Quebec. The other group would relocate the team to the Halifax area. At the Board of Governors meeting that day, the proposal to relocate the Antigonish franchise to New Richmond, Quebec was not considered to be in the best interests of the league and its members. The Governors did leave the door open to the sale to a Halifax group and a move to Metro Halifax. The sale and relocation of the franchise to Halifax was later approved.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>At the same Governors meeting, in response to the decision to leave the door open on the sale of the Bulldogs, the owners of the Halifax Wolverines announced their plans to move to Bridgewater. The Governors voted on the decision and it was approved. Following a name the team contest, the franchise was dubbed the Bridgewater Lumberjacks.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Later that week on April 29, the Moncton Beavers announced that they had failed to come to terms on a new lease for the Tim Hortons 4-Ice centre and had subsequently moved themselves to the neighboring city of Dieppe. The team was renamed the Dieppe Commandos.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Rounding out this very busy month in the history of the MJAHL was the Charlottetown Abbies' decision on May 1 to apply for a leave of absence for one year, which was accepted.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>The Halifax franchise (former Antigonish Bulldogs) announced on August 22 that the club would be known as the Halifax Lions. This was the name of the successful Halifax team in the 1980s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In 2010, the MJAHL changed its name to the Maritime Hockey League and unveiled a new logo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In 2011 the Halifax Lions moved to Dartmouth and were renamed the Metro Marauders. Two years later the Marauders were renamed the Metro Shipbuilders for the 2012-2013 season. That season was a disaster for the Shipbuilders, as they only recorded four wins in their 52-game schedule and averaged just 232 fans per game. The relocation rumours had them moving back to Halifax after three years in Dartmouth but they finally moved to Kentville and were renamed the Valley Wildcats. After one season in Kentville they moved to Berwick.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In 2014 the league approved an expansion team in St. Stephen named the County Aces. As a result of the expansion, the league was back up to 12 teams for the first time since the folding of the Charlottetown Abbies in April 2008.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In November 2014, the league took over the ownership of the Bridgewater Lumberjacks after owner Ken Petrie left the team because of financial trouble. The team was sold two weeks later to a local businessman and the team was renamed the South Shore Lumberjacks.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In November 2016, the Dieppe Commandos announce they would be moving to Edmundston, New Brunswick after the 2016-2017 season, and be renamed the Edmundston Blizzard.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>The current MHL has twelve teams, six in each division. The league has hosted the Royal Bank Cup and Centennial Cup seven times, winning twice. MHL teams have also won seven Fred Page Cups as the Junior "A" Eastern Canadian champions to earn the right to compete for the Royal Bank Cup.
