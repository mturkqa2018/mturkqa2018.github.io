<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_and_Overview">Setting and Overview</span></h3>
<p><i>Season 13</i> is set on the once owned UNSC planet, Chorus, shortly after the Reds and Blues help end the Chorus Civil War between the Federal Army of Chorus (FAC) and the New Republic (NR), by exposing the involvement of Locus, Felix and their fellow mercenaries led by former UNSC Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Malcolm Hargrove. It is now all-out war with the Blood Gulch Crew and Chorus fighting against Hargrove and his space pirates.

<p>A new, unnamed UNSC Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee receives a recorded message from Epsilon Church. Church explains that the message contains documents and video files of the treasonous acts committed by the new chairman's predecessor, Malcolm Hargrove and his mercenaries, as well as the actions of the Reds and Blues, and the people of Chorus against the mercenaries. Church apologizes for sounding dramatic, as he explains that this is a story of how he <i>died</i>.

<p>A UNSC ship called the Tartarus stumbles upon a lone Pelican, and the ship's crew try to communicate with it. After the Pelican sends flashes of light to signify help, the crew on the Tartarus allow the ship to land in their docking bay, so they can assist it. When the crew approach the Pelican, weapons at the ready, they discover the ship's "sole" passenger: Felix. Felix quickly gets along with the Tartarus' crew, and asks them about their current situation. The crew explain that they're transporting criminals for the UNSC, and the ship's captain, Mayers, jokes that nobody gives a "rat's ass" about them. Felix, however, says that he's interested and proceeds to attack the crew members, causing Mayers to activate the ship's alarm. Unfortunately, Locus, accompanied by other mercenaries, de-cloak from the Pelican and raid the ship. After killing all of the ship's crew, along with their Captain, Locus and Felix make their way to the intercom, and inform the prisoners of their war situation on Chorus. Locus and Felix then explain that they are looking for people to recruit in their ranks and, in exchange, will get a large profit from it. Felix asks that if anyone is interested, to grasp their cell bars in solidarity. While some prisoners agree to join them, others refuse. Regardless, Felix opens the cells' airblock doors, purging several prisoners out into deep space. Felix and Locus remain unharmed with the use of their grav boots. After Felix closes the doors, Locus congratulates the remaining prisoners on being "hired".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Upon returning to the ship's main control bridge, a mercenary informs Locus and Felix of a prisoner, who saved himself from being purged by tying his bedsheets to his cell bars, wishing to speak with them. Locus and Felix agree to see the said prisoner, which turns out to be Aiden Price, the former Counselor of Project Freelancer. The Counselor tells Locus and Felix that he knows specific details about the Freelancers that they will find useful, such as Wash and Carolina's weaknesses. Skeptical at first, Locus and Felix agree to have Price join their ranks and the latter leads them to another prisoner that has history with Project Freelancer; a prisoner that he believes will be of good use.

Meanwhile, at an unknown location on Chorus, Grif asks Caboose what he is doing, in which the latter expresses his feeling of something bad about to happen.</td></tr>

<p>In Downtown Armonia, Grif is greeted by several Feds and Rebels, much to his annoyance. He then encounters Matthews, who thanks him for saving the armies back at Radio Jammer Station 1C, for the 57th time, angering Grif. Grif then asks Matthews about Kimball's whereabouts, in which the latter tells him that she's at the Armory. Grif makes his way there. At the armory, manned by Simmons, Lopez and Donut, Simmons and Donut argue with a Fed soldier regarding his heavy machine gun turret, as well as his armor color. Grif approaches them and asks them about Kimball's whereabouts. Donut explains that she was last seen in the training room, so Grif takes off to the training room, leaving Donut, Simmons and Lopez to continue arguing with the heavily armed soldier. At the Armonia Training Facility, Wash instructs newly promoted lieutenant Palomo, Smith, Bitters and Jensen during a target practice session. Grif interrupts the training, and asks Wash where Kimball is. Wash, in turn, brings up Grif's absence during training, and when the latter remorselessly admits that he wasn't present, Wash punishes the lieutenants for Grif's actions. Regardless, Wash informs Grif that Kimball is in a meeting with Doyle at the War Room, causing Grif to rush over there. At the War Room, Kimball and Doyle argue over the Feds' overuse of ammunition, due to them preferring to use Assault Rifles over DMRs. Grif interrupts them and complains about why he isn't allowed to have second helpings in the mess hall. Doyle explains to him that it is because since the two armies have joined forces, there have been current food shortages, but this quickly leads into an argument between him and Kimball. Grif continues to try to explain his case, but Kimball, annoyed, forces Grif out and places him on dish duty. After the two calm down, Doyle informs Kimball of their men's most recent assault.

At Charon Research Complex 2C, it is revealed that the Chorus assault force led by Tucker, Sarge, Epsilon Church and Carolina successfully captured the base. Tucker and Sarge taunt the captured mercenaries with a rendition of Queen's Another One Bites the Dust. Meanwhile, Carolina and Epsilon revert their focus on the intel regarding Freelancer equipment, and Church tells them to report back to their accompanying Feds and Rebels. When the two do so, Church and Carolina ponder over an alien-like structure nearby, wondering what other things Charon have been studying on Chorus.</td></tr>

<p>At Charon Research Complex 2C, a Fed approaches Carolina and Epsilon and informs them of their recovery of a domed energy shield. Carolina applauds the Fed and suggests they begin running some tests with it. Epsilon, however, states that they should instead focus on the floating tower, in which the Fed clarifies that it is actually a temple created by the aliens. Surprised by this, Epsilon and Carolina question the Fed on the temple, in which the latter explains that many of Chorus' inhabitants see these alien-structures as commonplace, with some of them even having visited them on tours. After Carolina tells the Fed to go secure the Freelancer equipment, Epsilon expresses his concerns about the temple despite how the residents of Chorus see it. Carolina then proposes they get help from someone who is an expert on the planet's alien technology: Dr. Grey. Dr. Grey is teleported to the research complex and explains, rather quickly, that the temple emerged from the ground after the UNSC pulled out but hasn't shown any activity thus far. After Tucker and Sarge enter the scene, Carolina orders Dr. Grey to study Charon's research while she and Epsilon take care of some armor upgrades.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
After they leave, Grif and Simmons suddenly teleport to the complex, with Tucker and Sarge wondering what took them so long to arrive. They explain that they had to leave Donut and Lopez in charge of the armory, with Lopez speaking to the troops and Donut incorrectly translating for him. After Grif grabs the pirates' weapons collected by Sarge and Tucker's team with a teleportation grenade, Dr. Grey announces her discovery over the intercom and asks for the Blood Gulch Crew to come see her. Inside the compound, Dr. Grey reveals to the Reds and Blues that Charon have been trying to activate many of the alien temples, primarily the one near the complex. She also states that she is going to find out what the nearby temple does and asks for volunteers to join her. Sarge and Tucker agree to accompany her, but Grey recommends that a four-man team would be ideal, prompting Epsilon to suggest a particular person: Caboose. Caboose is teleported to the complex and is overjoyed about going on the "field trip", running around the entire compound. Tucker, unfortunately, is less than cheerful.</td></tr>

<p>Tucker, Caboose, Sarge and Grey arrive at a Charon excavation site located near the entrance of the floating temple. The group approaches the site to find it deserted. Grey has Tucker, Caboose and Sarge keep watch while she investigates the temple. Caboose and Sarge stand watch on top of the site's base, while Tucker is with Grey as she is translating ancient alien language. When Tucker pulls out his plasma sword, a holographic projection lights up with a symbol over the door. Tucker carefully approaches it and when a projection of an alien suddenly appears, he swings his sword at it in shock and unintentionally activates the dormant temple, which gives off a bright purple light that can be seen by the Chorus soldiers at the captured Charon complex.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>While this has been going on, Grif and Simmons had returned to Armonia with the captured weapons. As Grif leaves to continue his laziness, he is confronted by the lieutenants and a mob of Chorus soldiers, who tell Grif that since he has been absent from training, Wash has been making them run an abundance of laps. Grif tries to leave but the mob attacks and beat him up. Meanwhile, Donut is playing with an old alien rifle that was with the captured weapons in the armory with Simmons looking on. As the events of the temple happened, the rifle instantly activates and starts randomly shooting, causing destruction and chaos in the armory. Lopez arrives shortly after the destruction ends, and claims that he is not cleaning the mess up.

Back at the alien temple, Tucker, Caboose, Sarge and Grey stand in awe in front of a huge arsenal of alien weapons and vehicles. As they try to make sense of what happened, a voice is heard speaking in an alien language. Thinking that the alien is trying to talk to them, Tucker says "What's up" to it, but the temple deactivates and the alien weapons and vehicles disappear. After Tucker receives a severe beating from Sarge, Grey reveals to Tucker that he has just activated technology that had been dormant for many millennia. A new projection lights up, this time showing a map of Chorus with a specific location being highlighted.</td></tr>

<p>Inside a tractor beam tower at Crash Site Alpha, the Counselor assures Felix and Locus that the prisoner they picked up, who calls himself Sharkface, will be useful to them. Suddenly, the tower shuts down and a space pirate informs Felix and Locus that all of their weapons and equipment have suddenly exploded. Just then, a red light appears behind the two mercenaries.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Doyle, Kimball, Wash and the Reds contact the group at Charon Research Complex 2C, who inform them of the activation of the alien tower. Grey reveals that all of the alien weapons and temples on Chorus weren't broken, they were just deactivated. Confused about how they did it, Tucker explains how his quest with the Alien (from The Blood Gulch Chronicles) and the revelation of his sword being a key caused the tower to activate, and ends his story by showing a picture of Junior on a fifth grade basketball team, confusing Doyle. After Wash gets everyone back on track, Carolina points out that because their Charon weaponry exploded, the space pirates most likely had the same experience with their weapons, giving them the advantage in numbers and weaponry. Kimball then states that while they've had small victories in the past few weeks, they still can't make contact with the UNSC due to the pirates' tractor beams and radio jammers. As a result, Kimball suggests they take down the tractor beams at Crash Site Alpha, but Wash and Doyle explain that the beams will be heavily guarded and won't be taken down easily. Regardless, Kimball argues that they must make some kind of move now while the pirates are down, prompting Tucker to bring up the map that the tower revealed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Tucker suggests they follow the coordinates and investigate where it leads and what is there but Kimball argues against it. Wash adds that the pirates will be able to track and follow them there, but Epsilon and Carolina state that they can't let whatever the coordinates lead to fall into Charon's hand. As a result, Doyle proposes they divide and conquer, with the Blues, Dr. Grey and Carolina following the coordinates and Kimball leading an attack with the Reds, Rebels and Feds to Crash Site Alpha. All the while, Doyle, Donut and Lopez will stay and guard Armonia.

Back at Crash Site Alpha, a space pirate informs Felix and Locus of the destruction of all their weapons and equipment, with Locus ordering the pirate to send in the scientists in response. Another pirate then radios the two and informs them about a communications request from Control. Felix tells the pirate to tell Control that they'll call right back, revealing Felix and Locus staring at a map similar to the one at the alien temple, showing the same coordinates.</td></tr>

<p>At Armonia, the Chorus armies prepare for their assault on Crash Site Alpha. Kimball approaches two Feds and orders them to line up their warthog with the others, but the two tell her that she must fill out a vehicle request form for them to do so. Wash steps in and reiterates Kimball's exact orders to the Feds, which the two respectfully follow without question. As Kimball expresses her dislike for the Feds Wash advises that she should have faith in them and they may do the same to her. Suddenly, Jensen passes by in a Warthog and crashes it, somehow causing a large pile up of vehicles (She was going five miles per hour).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Meanwhile, the Blues, Dr. Grey and Carolina make a pit stop at an uncharted area on Chorus in order to refuel their warthogs. Carolina suggests that she and Church test out their enhancements while they wait, but Church advises her to loosen up, not wanting her to outwork herself. After the others finish refueling, Tucker makes a sexual joke and says his signature "Bow chicka bow wow!" catchphrase, but is interrupted by Carolina, who says it too in an attempt to loosen up. This, unfortunately, only causes the situation to grow awkward.

Meanwhile, Locus and Felix are seen in the depths of a jungle, preparing to contact Hargrove. Upon calling him, Chairman Hargrove, while aboard the Staff of Charon, expresses his anger over the destruction of their modified weaponry and chastises the two mercenaries for their inability to eliminate the Blood Gulch Crew and Chorus armies, despite all of the resources he's provided them. So, as a way of motivating the two, Hargrove reveals what he refers to as, "the future of modern warfare": the Meta's armor. Hargrove describes the modifications he's made to the armor, with it now being able to support all of the attained Freelancer enhancements at once. However, he adds that running multiple enhancements would be too taxing for one individual, so Felix suggests they capture Epsilon. Hargrove explains that Epsilon is too old to run the suit and that he is trying to acquire an A.I. through more legitimate means, though the late Director's actions have made this extremely difficult. Regardless, Hargrove makes a deal with Locus and Felix: if the two can accomplish their mission before the armor is completed, Charon will lend them the suit for their own personal use. But if they fail, Hargrove will find another candidate for the suit of armor to complete what the two mercenaries could not, as well as tie up any loose ends (possibly killing off Locus and Felix). Locus and Felix agree to Hargrove's terms and end their transmission with him. Soon after, the two mercenaries regroup with the other space pirates, having arrived at the location of the map's coordinates.</td></tr>

<p>The space pirates arrive at the alien installation displayed on the map. Locus and Felix meet one of their scientists, who explains that the device they found there is some sort of gateway. He also states that there seems to be a sort of strong energy coming from the Beam. When asked if it could be weaponized, the scientist explains that it can not, for its power could be too great. Nearby texts reveal that the gateway will only allow someone who is judged to be a "true warrior" through. When the scientist is unable to explain the consequences for failing, Felix pushes one of his soldiers into the gateway to test it out. Meanwhile, Sharkface is approached by the Counselor while armoring up for his mission: to kill Agents Washington and Carolina. The Counselor attempts to evaluate his psychology and go over the mission briefing, but Sharkface is dismissive of him. But, he reveals that he has had a past encounter with the two Agents stating that they 'dropped a building' on him, 'killing all his friends'. He then asks the Counselor how he ended up on the Tartarus, and the latter reluctantly reveals that he was betrayed by people he trusted, and upon further prodding, admits that he would kill them if it would allow him to repair his life.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Back at the alien installation, the soldier returns from the gateway and claims to have had visions of "everyone he ever wronged". The scientist checks him over and states that he is physically healthy, despite his scares. Felix is annoyed at the potential visions he would experience, stating that meeting everyone he ever wronged would take weeks. However, Locus decides to personally attempt the test since the group is short on time. Reluctantly, Felix agrees and goes with him, telling him not to 'cry if he loses'. In the gateway, Locus' equipment malfunctions. While attempting to contact Felix, he is questioned by an ominous voice, questioning who he is. Before he could respond, he is immediately ambushed by a group of UNSC soldiers who believe he is a monster and cannot understand his attempts to communicate.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p>
The group's leader attempts to interrogate Locus, to no avail. Suddenly, much to Locus' surprise, Felix and another Locus appear with the leader. While the illusory Locus believes the "monster" is scared and could be convinced to surrender, the illusory Felix states that they are short on time and cannot afford to take prisoners. The leader agrees with Felix and sends him and the illusory Locus to dispose of the real Locus in a secure location. When the illusory Locus further protests, the leader angrily tells him that on the battlefield, he is nothing more than a suit of armor and a gun. This angers the real Locus, who points his gun at the leader and causes the UNSC troops to shoot him. Locus returns to reality, where Felix is waiting for him; he reveals that he also experienced things straight out of his nightmares. Felix and Locus decide that they cannot use the gateway, order their troops to prepare for 'Plan B', and leave the area. However, Locus ponders a brief second on his recent encounter. It's quite possible that Locus was the alien that he and his team encountered a long time ago. After some time has passed, the Blues, Dr. Grey and Carolina arrive.</td></tr>

<p>The Reds, Wash and the Chorus armies arrive at the Desert Refueling Station in order to refuel their vehicles. Wash approaches the Reds and updates them on the status of the Blues, Dr. Grey and Carolina detailing their discovery of a large jungle temple emitting energy into the sky. Wash then expresses his admiration for the Reds for their decision to fight with the Chorus armies, and recollects on their past experiences together. Seeing through his sentimentality, Grif and Simmons realize that Wash believes they are going to die on the mission, but Wash denies this. Wash then asks what unit they're in, in which Sarge states that he's volunteered them for the front lines, which shocks Grif and Simmons. Wash suggests that they look on the bright side, but miserably fails to follow up on what the bright side is.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Meanwhile, at the jungle temple, Dr. Grey informs the Blues and Carolina the temple's rules after deciphering them. Tucker suggests that he fits the bill of being a true warrior simply because he possesses the sword. The others go along with it and allow Tucker to enter. However, Tucker is quickly forced out after entry and tells the others that he saw multiple illusions of Felix and Locus, while on the other side, who all quickly overwhelmed him. As a result, Carolina decides to enter the portal herself. Upon entry, Carolina immediately loses contact with Epsilon and is soon spoken to by a booming alien voice, the same that spoke with Locus before, who questions her on who she is. Carolina states that she is his true warrior but an illusion of Tex appears and states otherwise, shocking Carolina. Suddenly, the rest of the Freelancers appear behind Carolina, shocking her even more. After Carolina returns from the portal, Epsilon, having only seen static after entering, questions her on what she saw, but Carolina refuses to discuss it. As a result, the group decide to send Caboose through, believing his strength and "empty head" may correspond with the instructions.

After Caboose enters the portal he is spoken to by the alien voice, who quickly becomes amazed at the state of Caboose's mind lacking any fear, self-doubt, or negativity. In addition, the alien voice also expresses his surprise of Caboose's physical strength, stating that his action of increasing the gravity had no effect on Caboose. Due to this, the alien reveals himself to Caboose and proclaims him to be a true warrior. Upon exiting the portal, Caboose reveals the alien to the others, which he named Santa. Santa greets the group and explains that he is actually an A.I. construct left on Chorus by his Creators to ensure that their relics are passed down to those they deem worthy. While the group is dumbfounded at the fact that the A.I. is named Santa, Santa bows down to the noble warriors.</td></tr>

<p>As Kimball and the Chorus force make their way to Crash Site Alpha, one of her soldiers informs her about the away team's discovery of Santa. Upon hearing this news, Kimball and the entire force halt in their tracks.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>At the Jungle Temple, Santa explains to the Away Team about his creators and the treasures they've scattered throughout the galaxy, with Chorus containing some of the most valuable. He states that Tucker activated the â€œTemple of Armsâ€ (which activates all alien weapons on Chorus) back at the excavation site, prompting Tucker to ask why he deactivated it afterward. In response, Santa reveals that not long ago a group of meddlers gained partial control of the tractor beams and used them to manipulate the planetâ€™s gravitational field. This reveals that Locus, Felix, and their band of Space Pirates were truly responsible for the Red's and Blue's shipwreck from Season 11. He then adds that he deactivated the Temple of Arms because Tucker did not respond in the voice of his people and needed to bring him to the Jungle Temple due to protocol for further testing. Dr. Grey then questions why he tested them if Tucker already had a key, in which Santa reveals that the key of Chorus, located in an east mountain temple, had not yet been obtained and had to make sure that the presence of two keys was not an error. Carolina and Epsilon then ask Santa about the other temples on Chorus. Upon listing them out that include Weather Manipulation, Bountiful Harvest, Interior Decorating and Procreation (increasing one's sexual drive), Santa describes the Temple of Communication, which has the power to transfer a signal to any desired communication device in the galaxy and is capable of ripping through the Space Pirates' radio jammers "without question". This excites the group, now knowing they can radio for help.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Because of this, the group decide to cease Kimballâ€™s assault and head for the Temple of Communication. Before they leave, Santa informs them of the 'Purge', which has the ability to exterminate all sentient life on Chorus upon activation by a key in case the Chorus inhabitants are deemed not worthy of receiving his Creator's gifts. After Epsilon asks for its location Santa displays the coordinates for him and reveals that he updates all of the temples with these maps. Unfortunately, Church gets a bad feeling, and a band of Space Pirates, after listening in on their conversation, ambush the group. Luckily, Carolina activates her Domed Energy Shield and saves her teammates, before the pirates could shoot them down. Sharkface then appears and orders his men, once the shield fails, to kill everyone except Carolina, so that he can kill her himself. He then leaves for the east mountains to get the key, but not before thanking them for the information and revealing that the space pirates are waiting for their friends at Alpha.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Meanwhile, at Alpha, the Reds and Chorus force arrives and executes their attack on the space pirates. However, the Tartarus soon emerges from the sky and hovers over them, with countless Space Pirates jumping out of it, quickly outnumbering them. Felix then briefly radios Kimball, reminding her he was her right-hand man and knew about this attack, much to her anger. Before Kimball could scold Felix, he mutes her. Immediately after, Sharkface contacts Locus and Felix and informs them about the Purge and the location of the key that can activate it, stating that he is on his way there now. Felix decides to go after it with Sharkface while Locus stays at Alpha. Before leaving, Felix tells Locus to kill Kimball quick if he gets the chance, since she and Felix were friends after all.

Back in Armonia, Doyle receives a distress call from Kimball, who informs him of the pirates' ambush and demands that he send reinforcements to assist them at Alpha.

<p>With the battle raging at Crash Site Alpha, two Feds, one of which is injured, call for a medic. The Rebel Medic rushes over to assist them but quickly becomes confused after the injured Fed explains that his "lap" was shot, as well as his "tummy". As the Reds drive past, Sarge pitches a strategy to overcome the enemy, by creating a slow motion car crash. Not fond of the plan, however, Grif and Simmons suggest they regroup with Wash. Eventually, the assault team are overwhelmed by Charon fire, forcing them to take cover inside the ship. Simmons comes up with a plan to create a large smokescreen by using the shipâ€™s engine in order to create an escape. The lieutenants agree to help him, though Bitters warns him that sniper fire is coming from out of nowhere in that area (Most likely from Locus), in which Wash states that heâ€™ll take care of it.

Carolina tells Epsilon to prep her Speed Boost but the latter assures her that it wonâ€™t work. With Santa being unable to assist them and the shield running out of power, Dr. Grey orders Freckles to run command â€œAimbotâ€ and proceeds to hop through the portal. After the shield lowers, Freckles, in response to Greyâ€™s command, rapidly fires at the four pirates and kills them. After Grey returns from the portal, the team is contacted by friendly forces, who inform them that a Pelican is en route to their position. Confused, Carolina explains that Doyle was supposed to send troops to the east mountains first, in which the soldier assures her that he did.

It is then revealed that the recipient of the key is Doyle, who was dropped off by Lopez and Donut via Pelican. Lopez informs Doyle that theyâ€™ll have to land farther away from his position because the temple is interfering with their controls, though Doyle doesnâ€™t understand him. Despite this, Doyle is forced to hide after the pirates begin searching for him. The away team finally arrives at the Temple of the Key, where Carolina radios Doyle inquiring about his location.

However, Tucker and Caboose admit that they did not realize he was gone and radio the Reds asking if they knew of Docâ€™s disappearance, though they too did not until remembering Grif teleported him.

<p>Somewhere out in the eastern mountain range, Carolina catches up to a fleeing Sharkface and the two quickly engage in battle. Carolina initially bests Sharkface but the latter gets up and disarms Carolina of her weapons. Meanwhile, at Crash Site Alpha, a Fed and a Rebel fight over a section of cover until the Rebel is killed by a cloaked Locus. Locus is then informed by one of his men that enemy reinforcements are nearby, though Locus shows no sign of worry as he acknowledges his assurance that the Chorus armies will be dead before their help arrives. Suddenly, Washington speaks to Locus via open channel radio and gets him to give away his position by causing him to shoot at his empty helmet, which Wash raises by using his battle rifle. Upon seeing the sniper's vapor trail, the lieutenants fire at Locus and force him to take cover. Jensen then gives Kimball and the Reds the okay to release the smokescreen, which they do, shrouding the battlefield in black smoke. After the Reds kill numerous Space Pirates by executing a slow-motion car crash, they, along with the rest of the assault team, escape Alpha. Wash then radios Locus again and reveals that he knew the latter was watching him while he was with the Federal Army and decided to watch him too. He then adds that he is the real soldier while Locus is simply a killer, before logging off. In response, Locus demands a vehicle.

As both exhibit impressive moves and fighting tactics, Carolina dislocates Sharkface's shoulder. However, Sharkface quickly fastens it back in place and begins to outmatch Carolina, nearly burning her face off with a flamethrower installed right into his armor. After Carolina breaks free from his grasp she finally realizes who Sharkface is and proceeds to attack. She manages to knock him down onto a frozen lake but Sharkface cracks it open, causing him to fall through into a tunnel, though he grabs Carolina with a grappling hook and drags her down as well. As the two slide their way out of the tunnel, Carolina demands Epsilon activate all of her armor enhancements, though the latter shows worry. Although Epsilon helps Carolina use her bubble shield, Adaptive Camouflage, and Speed Boost against Sharkface, the latter still outdoes her. Feeling overwhelmed, Carolina tells Epsilon to run her healing unit but the latter states that it's too much for him to handle, though she refuses to give up. Sharkface then uses his flamethrowers, combined with a self-made explosion via two frag grenades, to propel himself towards Carolina, forcing her to flee.

As she approaches the edge of the cliff Carolina decides to confront Sharkface head on, but Epsilon argues against this. As Carolina turns around to face Sharkface and Sharkface catching up fast, Epsilon sends out his memory counterparts of Delta and Theta for help. Unfortunately, both Theta and Delta quickly dematerialize, as Epsilon becomes incapable of running multiple enhancements at once. Unable to help Carolina, Epsilon dematerializes as well. As a result, Carolina trips and falls off the edge of the cliff and lands in the snow below. Sharkface then looks over the ledge and slowly walks away.</td></tr>

When Felix corners him, Doyle threatens to drop the "sword" down into the chasm below, though Felix doesn't believe he has the courage to do it. As Felix slowly approaches Doyle, demanding that he hand over the sword, Doyle gives in and turns the sword off. However, rather than hand it over to Felix, Doyle tosses the sword high into the air, prompting Felix to lunge for it before it falls down the cliff. As Doyle leaps to the opposite side he spots Tucker, Caboose, Donut, and Lopez approaching and warns them that Felix now has the sword. Upon seeing Felix, the crew fire at him, but the latter takes cover behind his Hardlight Shield and holsters the key onto his thigh. After some quick banter, Felix hitches a ride with Locus when the latter arrives in a Falcon and the two make their escape. Doyle worries over what the pirates will do now that they have the sword but Tucker explains to him that the sword will be useless to the pirates since Doyle is still alive.

Sarge suggests that they go to the Temple of Communication and contact Earth as quickly as possible. However, both Wash and Doyle state that they shouldn't make hasty moves like they did for Crash Site Alpha, though Kimball argues against them. Doyle rebuttals by stating that if they send Tucker out to the tower he will be killed and Charon will gain two swords. Kimball, in turn, explains to Doyle that they must take risks in order to get results. She then adds that he should've thrown the sword off the mountain and sacrificed himself during his confrontation with Felix, proceeding to call him a "stupid selfish coward," before storming off. Hurt, Doyle returns to his quarters. Wash then acknowledges that while the Feds and Rebels are fighting alongside each other they still do not trust each other. The Reds and Blues state that it took them years to trust each other and tell Wash that it will take time for the Chorus armies to do the same.

Despite this, Doc becomes furious at the fact that nobody questioned his absence between now and then and grows maniacal like Omega. Upon hearing the sudden change in his tone of voice, Dr. Grey quickly displays interest in Doc's split personality and attempts to conduct electroshock therapy on him, prompting the latter to flee. After Grey and Donut chase after him, Carolina informs Epsilon that they need to talk. Elsewhere, the other Reds and Blues minus Wash attempt to get Palomo and a Fed to socialize peacefully, though the two continue to show acrimony towards each other. Because of this, the crew allow the two to leave. Grif then suggests that they should lie to both Doyle and Kimball by specifying that the other wants to apologize over a dinner, but the others disagree.

Epsilon tries to avoid the question at first but Carolina demands an answer from him. In response, Epsilon explains that although he is not failing, he has his limits and cannot run multiple armor enhancements by himself, due to the fact that he is only an A.I. fragment. While Carolina apologizes to Epsilon for pushing him too far, she acknowledges that his inability to run multiple enhancements can't be used as an excuse, as they must use any advantage they can in order to defeat the Space Pirates. Because of this, Epsilon warns Carolina not to follow in the Meta's footsteps, as his ambition to gain as much power as possible led to his downfall. Offended and hurt, Carolina reveals to Epsilon that she saw her fellow Freelancers die while inside the portal at the Jungle Temple. In addition, she also saw the Blood Gulch Crew die soon after, and fearfully states that she doesn't want to lose another family. Doyle soon appears and consoles Carolina, stating that he knows what it's like to be afraid. He then states that "Courage is not the absence of fear. It is acting in spite of it." though incorrectly states that the quote is from William Shakespeare (The quote is actually from Mark Twain). Despite Doyle's mistake, Epsilon and Carolina acknowledge their liking to the quote. Church hopes that the Space Pirates are having problems too.

Price explains that while Maine withstood many lethal injuries that would normally kill a man, the puncture wounds in his armor, caused by Tucker's sword, caused him to die of asphyxiation by drowning. Already aware of this, Locus questions why the Meta was unable to prevent his own demise despite having an advantage, in which Price explains that the Blood Gulch Crew had something the Freelancers never did: complete faith in one another. Although, Price notes that if the Reds and Blues fought the Meta while he still possessed his A.I., events could've played out differently. When Locus asks why, Price reminds him that Agent Maine and the Meta are two different psyches, in which the Meta is the result of Sigma manipulating Maine. He then explains that after the A.I. fragments were destroyed the Meta psyche was too, leaving Maine a broken shell of a man who uncontrollably continued to follow Sigma's goal. After Locus asks how Maine was before he became the Meta, Price describes that Maine was a brute who displayed no qualms in following orders because he knew that, at his core, he was a soldier whose actions served the greater good. Locus then argues that a soldier's actions should be nothing more than a result of following orders, though Price states that those traits make one a slave. When Locus asks if the Meta was at his best when controlled by Sigma during his goal of perfection, Price rectifies him saying that the Meta's goal was to be human, not to be the perfect weapon.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Upon hearing this, Locus asks no more questions. Price then notes Locus' change in behavior after his trip through the gateway at the Jungle Temple, with Price noting that the temple shows those who enter the gateway their greatest fear, though Locus denies this. As Price continues to pry he asks Locus if he wants to know what Felix is afraid of most, catching Locus off-guard. Suddenly, Felix appears and informs Locus that he is needed with the rest of the team, prompting Locus to join his comrades. Felix then approaches the Counselor, sarcastically complementing his work on Sharkface. Felix then intentionally wonders what will happen if Sharkface found out the Counselor used to work for Project Freelancer before logging off.

Back at Armonia, the Blood Gulch Crew continue to try to get Kimball and Doyle to socialize, this time with Tucker and Caboose (which ended poorly as well), but the two are still reluctant to go through with it. As they begin to argue, Church and Carolina enter the scene, unaware of what's going on. Kimball ultimately decides to leave, but not before Doc stops her and pleads for her to say something nice to Doyle. As a result, Kimball reveals that she initially believed Doyle to be a tyrant bent on control but now sees him as an incompetent individual. Doyle, on the other hand, admits his admiration for Kimball's courage and wished he had the same traits. He then attempts to persuade Kimball to have their armies work together, but Kimball expresses her distrust. Wash then steps in, attempting to hopefully prompt Kimball and Doyle to work together, when a loud boom is heard from outside, causing the War Room to shake and alert the Blood Gulch crew. Smith then contacts the group via intercom and informs them that the Space Pirates are attacking, alarming the group. Doyle is surprised, stating that the Space Pirates wouldn't risk bombing the city, but it is revealed that they are not but dropping space pirates instead. Meanwhile, outside, Sharkface soon lands in the city and leads a squad of space pirates into Armonia.</td></tr>

<p>As a firefight ensues between the Space Pirates and Chorus armies throughout the streets of Armonia, the Reds and Blues contemplate on what they should do to survive the attack. While Sarge suggests they fight back, Epsilon proposes another idea, stating that the city is a deathtrap, but not for them. Meanwhile, at the Armonia hospital, the Space Pirates attack and kill two Feds who were attempting to protect Dr. Grey. Fortunately, the attacking pirates are taken out by Palomo, Smith, Bitters and Jensen who inform Grey that they are evacuating the capital. Surprised, Grey asks why, in which the four explain that because the pirates discharged all of their men inside the city, they will be able to take them all out by detonating the city's nuclear reactor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>In the streets, Doyle and the Reds and Blues reach the Armory and contact Carolina of their progress. Carolina, alongside Epsilon, Wash and Kimball, informs them to board the Pelican stationed there while they make their way to the reactor's manual overload through the underground maintenance tunnels. As they move forward they suddenly encounter Sharkface. Running out of time, Carolina agrees to stay and face him alone only if he allows Wash and Kimball to leave safely. Sharkface, in response, complies to this but states that he'll come after Wash when he kills Carolina.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>At the Armory, the Reds and Blues gather weapons and supplies to bring onto the Pelican, with Doc, in the personality of O'Malley, arming himself with a rocket launcher. Donut then alerts them of more mercenaries approaching, prompting Sarge to radio Grif on the status of the Pelican. Grif tells Sarge that he is having trouble getting the aircraft's engine to start and soon realizes that Lopez is trapped inside, who yells at Grif in anger because he was repairing the Pelican when Grif came. After Grif tells the others of this, Freckles alerts the group that the pirates are getting closer, prompting everyone to hide. The pirates then arrive to the Armory, and unfortunately, the Red's and Blue's are quickly discovered because of their poor hiding spots. As the mercs prepare to open fire, Doc/O'Malley eliminates them with his rocket launcher. With more pirates approaching, the crew decide to hold down the Armory until Lopez is released from the Pelican.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p>
Meanwhile, in an isolated part of the city, the fight between Carolina and Sharkface escalates, with the two bursting through the ground towards the surface. As Sharkface begins to mock Carolina, the latter suddenly apologizes for what she and Project Freelancer did to him and his comrades, pointing out that they were both on two different sides with individual goals, and she believed Project Freelancer to be the good guys. While surprised, Sharkface refutes her apology, angrily stating that it won't change what she and the Freelancers did and won't bring back his dead comrades. Understanding, Carolina tells Sharkface that she doesn't want to fight and offers him the choice to simply walk away. Muddled by Carolina's actions, Sharkface again refuses and proceeds to attack her.</td></tr>

<p>The Space Pirates continue firing upon the armory in order to get to Tucker and Doyle, but are unable to get inside due to the Blood Gulch Crew's combined firepower. As the crew fend off the pirates, Simmons informs them that he has successfully removed Lopez from the Pelican, prompting them to retreat to the garage to board the ship. However, Doyle decides to stay behind, explaining that the pirates will simply follow them once they leave on the Pelican, destroying their chances of killing them all in the city. So, in order to keep the mercenaries inside Armonia, Doyle flees on a Mongoose, inciting the pirates to chase after him and letting the Reds and Blues escape.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>As the Reds and Blues fly away on the Pelican in order to get Tucker to safety, the latter informs Wash and Kimball of Doyleâ€™s actions. Angered, Wash and Kimball contact Doyle and question his plan. Doyle tells them that he is the only thing keeping Charon inside the city and asks how long it will take for them to reach the reactor. Wash, in response, tells Doyle that he is unsure as Epsilon is not with them to guide them through the tunnels. Because of this, Doyle decides to go and set off the reactor himself, telling the two that he will meet them at the extraction point once he is done. Wash and Kimball then move towards the surface to assist Carolina.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Carolina and Sharkface brawl inside the monorail. However, unlike their last battle, Carolina is shown to be more focused, dodging several of Sharkface's attacks and even managing to outmatch him. When Sharkface attempts to attack her with his grappling hook, Carolina dodges it, with the hook attaching to a door. As the monorail reaches the LZ, Carolina pulls the hook's wire and launches the door it's connected to straight at Sharkface, throwing him out onto the street below. After Carolina jumps out of the monorail, she and Sharkface are left exhausted. As Wash and Kimball arrive to aid Carolina, the latter tells Sharkface that he has lost. Sharkface, however, refuses to accept this and declares that as long as he is alive he will continue to hunt them down until they're all dead. As a result, Wash and Kimball swiftly execute Sharkface.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Wash then contacts the Reds and informs them that they have made it to the extraction point. The Reds, in response, inform Wash that they have safely dropped off the Blues and are heading to the LZ now. Kimball then radios Doyle and asks him if he's ready, in which the latter states that he is almost finished. Suddenly, a space pirate corners Doyle and fires at him, but Doyle ducks and manages to kill the pirate. Unfortunately, the mercenary's bullets destroy the reactor controls, making it impossible for Doyle to overload the reactor remotely. With no other option, Doyle equips himself with a Sticky Detonator left behind by the dead pirate and informs Kimball, Wash, and Carolina that he will have to detonate the reactor's core himself. Concerned, Kimball volunteers to help Doyle, but Doyle denies her request, finalizing his decision to risk his own life in order to protect them, just like she would have done. As the Reds arrive at the extraction point, Kimball, distressed, warns Doyle that if Felix isn't in the city he will be placing the sword right into his hands. Doyle, in response, expresses his confidence that she will be able to stop Felix if he isn't. As Carolina and Wash get Kimball inside the ship, Doyle reaches the reactor's core and sticks a sticky grenade onto it, just as the pirates make their way towards him. With the grenade set to explode in less than a minute, Doyle demands that Kimball and the others leave the city quickly, though Kimball pleads for Doyle to stop. Doyle then says his final goodbyes to Kimball by telling her that Chorus still needs her, and to make sure that the people she leaves behind will be able to carry on without her, before signing off. As Kimball finally boards the Pelican, she and the others fly out of the city.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p>
As the space pirates find and surround Doyle at the reactor core they quickly discover his grenade and proceed to warn Locus and Felix on board the Tartarus. The two mercenaries, as a result, order the pilot to get them out of the city. The grenade then explodes, creating a nuclear blast that destroys Armonia, kills Doyle and a large number of space pirates. Meanwhile, Kimball and the Blood Gulch Crew attempt to flee from the explosion as fast as possible but are unable to escape the blast radius. In order to protect the ship, Carolina, with Epsilon's assistance, activates her domed energy shield, just as the blast reaches them.</td></tr>

<p>After successfully deploying Carolinaâ€™s bubble shield, and in turn saving the Reds, Wash and Kimball from the nuclear blast, Epsilon briefly cycles through his memories of Theta, Delta, and Omega, before awakening at Crash Site Bravo in front of a relieved Blood Gulch Crew. Carolina informs Epsilon that the Feds and Rebels are scattered across the planet as a result of Armonia's destruction, with several soldiers mourning at Bravo. She then expresses her concern for Kimball, as the Feds blame her for Doyleâ€™s death. Wash then approaches the two and explains to Epsilon that Felix and Locus survived the nuclear blast.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Meanwhile, it is revealed that Locus and Felix have regrouped at the Jungle Temple, with the Great Key now fully functional for Felix. As the two approach Santa in preparation to activate the Purge, Felix asks him if they will be safe from the Purgeâ€™s effects. Santa, drearily, assures him that those residing inside the Temple of the Purge will be spared. While Felix exhibits his joy of the news Locus expresses his concern about the safety of the space pirates guarding the communication temple. Felix tries to persuade Locus to simply let them die, but Locus insinuates his disagreement, saying that some of them are former partners. In response, Felix explains that their comradesâ€™ trust in them does not allow them immunity and states that survival is a privilege that must be earned. A space pirate then radios the two and informs them that Control would like to speak to them about the loss of Armoniaâ€™s artifacts. Felix decides to go speak with the Chairman himself and wonders if the latter would be interested in an alien A.I. After Felix leaves, Santa expresses his growing skepticism of him actually being a true warrior. Locus then asks Santa on what Felix saw after he passed through the portal and what he is afraid of. Santa tells Locus that the answer is obvious, before disappearing to prepare for the Purge.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>Back at Bravo, the Blood Gulch Crew finalize their plan. Knowing that Locus will be with Felix, Carolina and Wash agree to go on â€œdefenseâ€ (preventing Felix and Locus from activating The Purge) while the Reds and Blues go on â€œoffenseâ€ (They along with the Chorus armies assaulting the Communications Temple). However, the Reds and Doc bring up the fact that they are low on ammo and the armies are still not working together, in which Kimball, who approaches the crew, suggests that she talk to them. While concerned, the crew allow her to speak with the armies.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p>
Kimball manages to get the attention of all the Fed and Rebel soldiers scattered around Chorus and begins her speech. She admits that she didnâ€™t believe the armiesâ€™ truce would last even if they managed to defeat Charon, as she still saw the Federal Army as the enemy. However, she explains to the soldiers that when one spends everyday fighting a war, one learns to demonize the enemy and begins seeing them as evil or even sub-human. Kimball then admits that she was afraid to see what the Federal Army truly were: their brothers and sisters. She adds that while theyâ€™ve all done horrible things to each other, Doyle was able to see past that and understood that their fight against Charon was a time for unity. Kimball tells the armies that if they donâ€™t unite and fight as one they wonâ€™t have a tomorrow and persuades the soldiers of Chorus to fight with her in order to defeat the Chairman and the Space Pirates once and for all. In response to her speech, all of the Feds and Rebels ecstatically cheer to Kimball in unity (except Palomo, who instead accidentally reveals he has a crush on Jenson). After the Blood Gulch Crew commend Kimball on her rousing speech, Kimball informs them that they still have something Charon doesnâ€™t. The Reds and Blues then venture back to the Charon Excavation Site, where they are warmly welcomed by Santa. Tucker then approaches the temple and pulls out his sword, reactivating the Temple of Arms.</td></tr>

<p>Felix and Locus arrive at the Purge but are suddenly shocked to discover Wash, Epsilon, and Carolina standing in their path. Wash attempts to talk them out of activating the temple as it will kill both the people of Chorus as well as their own men. Though Locus ponders over this, Felix convinces him that they must follow their orders.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the space pirates are shown guarding the Communication Temple, until one of them spots Kimball nearby. Kimball quickly kills the pirate with an alien rifle and is soon accompanied by numerous Feds and Rebels, all armed with alien weaponry. As the pirates open fire, Kimball orders the combined armies to attack, which they proudly do. Finally united as one, the Feds and Rebels quickly lay waste to several of the remaining pirates, with the Reds and Blues, armed with an alien tank, assisting in the assault. Now under heavy fire, the pirates send a distress call to Felix, Locus, and the Counselor, who is aboard the Tartarus, explaining that the armies have obtained several alien armaments.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Running out of time, Felix and Locus fire at Wash and Carolina, who proceed to take cover. When Locus manages to disarm Carolina, Wash, in turn, lobs a grenade into the air to distract Locus. When Locus shoots the grenade, Wash shoots and disables Locus' Sniper rifle, forcing the two mercs to restrategize. As a result, the two charge towards the Freelancers, with Felix using his Hardlight Shield as cover while Locus jumps onto a hovering platform, in order to reach the temple's back entrance. Using her grappling hook, Carolina pursues Locus and the two engage in combat. All the while, Wash engages Felix, with Felix attempting to kill Wash with his daggers. After Wash dodges Felix's attacks, however, Felix pulls out his sword.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Meanwhile, on board the Tartarus, the Counselor suggests to the pirates on the bridge that they abandon the mission. Informed by Felix that Price might turn on them, the Space Pirate partnered with Price attempts to kill him as a result but notices that his pistol is missing. Price, having stolen the latter's pistol, kills the merc and forces the pilot to fly the ship away from Chorus. Back at the Purge, Felix fights off Wash and rushes towards the temple. After Wash warns Carolina, the latter catches Felix with her grappling hook and proceeds to reel him in. However, as Felix is dragged off the side of the pathway he grabs Wash and threatens to drop the latter if Carolina drops him. As a result, Carolina pulls the two onto the bottom of the hovering platform she and Locus are on.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p>
After a brief clash between the two pairs, the four regroup on the top of the platform, but quickly duck after a larger one hovers over. After Felix and Locus hop onto the platform, Carolina and Wash chase after them, eventually ending up on the same platform as the two mercs. As Carolina fights Felix, Wash struggles to battle a cloaked Locus. So, in order to see him, Wash slices his hand with one of Felix's daggers and throws the blood onto Locus' chest plate, proceeding to impale the dagger itself into his chest plate upon finding him. After Locus knocks Wash down, he tries to stab him, but Wash blocks him and explains that if he kills him it will prove that he is a killer. As Locus calls Felix for help, Felix slashes Carolina's back and attempts to stab Wash himself. Luckily, Wash pushes Locus off him and dodges Felix's attack, who instead impales the platform's center, disabling it. With the platform going down, the four hop back onto the pathway, where Wash and Carolina reveal that they were only attempting to stall them and explain that although Armonia was destroyed, the pirates left their own home base, Crash Site Alpha, wide open. At Alpha, Dr. Grey and the lieutenants reactivate the tractor beams, drawing the Tartarus back towards the planet; specifically, straight to the Purge. As a result, Wash, Carolina, Locus and Felix flee from the temple, with the former two taking cover within Carolina's bubble shield and the latter two taking cover behind Felix's light shield. The Tartarus then crashes into the temple, destroying it and killing the Counselor. Fortunately, thanks to Epsilon's assistance, Wash and Carolina survive and the three leave to regroup with Kimball and the others. Nearby, however, Felix draws out his arm from a pile of rubble, having survived the destruction.</td></tr>

<p>The battle between the Chorus armies and space pirates rages on at the Communication Temple, with the former army beginning to overwhelm the latter. As the pirates are forced to fall back, Kimball and the Reds and Blues move forward towards the entrance of the temple. Tucker soon joins them, accompanied with Wash, Epsilon and Carolina, who inform the crew of the destruction of the Purge as well as the deaths of Felix and Locus. Epsilon then notifies them of a teleporter inside the temple that leads to the control room. Just then, a Mantis operated by the space pirates begins killing several Chorus soldiers. Because of this, Carolina gives Epsilon to Tucker and allows the Reds and Blues to go to the control room while she and Wash stay and fight outside with the Chorus armies. After the Reds and Blues pass through the teleporter they arrive at the control room and are greeted by Santa. As Santa begins preparing the temple for activation, he then mentions that there may be a small problem. When Tucker asks Santa what that may be, he disappears in time for the crew to discover Felix flying towards them in a Falcon. As the crew scatter, the Falcon crashes down at the control room. Felix, along with an exhausted Locus, readies himself to fight the Reds and Blues. As he tries to force Locus to join him, the latter explains that, with the Tartarus destroyed and their numbers low, their mission has failed. However, Felix furiously tells him that he is not doing this for the mission or Hargrove but for himself and leaves to find the crew.

Being unable to help them, Wash tells Tucker that he and the others will have to deal with them alone, but expresses his confidence that they will come out successful, with the exception of Doc disagreeing. As Felix searches for the crew, Locus struggles to keep up with him and soon collapses. Santa reveals himself to him and asks why he is doing what heâ€™s doing, but Locus repeatedly replies that he doesnâ€™t know. When Santa asks Locus if he would like to know something Locus requests to know what Felix is afraid of. Santa, in response, tells Locus that Felix is afraid of him. Meanwhile, Felix calls out to Tucker in fury until the latter confronts him. After a brief Sword fight, Felix knocks Tucker to the ground, until the other Reds and Blues intervene and attack Felix, quickly overpowering him. When Felix becomes surrounded, Locus approaches the crew, but does not harm them. Instead he gives up his weapon and tells Felix that he is not a soldier, but a monster like him. Felix pleads Locus to rethink what heâ€™s doing but Locus disregards him. As a result, Felix attacks everyone but quickly gets a sticky grenade caught on his hardlight shield, fired by Simmons. Tucker then throws a frag grenade towards Felix, which blasts him over the edge of the control room and sends him plummeting to his death.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p>
With Felix dead, Locus, having obtained Felix's sword after the latter threw it at him, becomes the new bearer of the Great Key and activates the Comm. Temple for the Reds and Blues. While the crew refuse to forgive Locus for everything he has done, the latter expresses his understanding and explains that he will make things right, though he will not be imprisoned. Epsilon warns Locus that if he runs they will find him, but Locus assures him that they will not, before cloaking. With the temple now active, the crew proceed to broadcast their message. The process is successful as the message, spoken by Epsilon, quickly transmits to several communication devices across the galaxy, including the UNSC HQ on Earth, a Sangheili Embassy where Junior, alive and fully grown, resides, and even Blood Gulch, finally confirming Sister's continued existence. With the message and its files making its way across the galaxy, the receivers are made aware of Chorusâ€™ location, the survival of the Reds and Blues, and Chairman Hargroveâ€™s crimes on the planet. After Epsilon ends the message, the Feds and Rebels rejoice, having destroyed the Mantis as well as defeating the remaining space pirates. Kimball then happily informs the crew of a ship approaching Chorus from slipspace. Unfortunately, the ship is revealed to be the Staff of Charon, with Hargrove himself, stationed inside the ship, proclaiming that the group has made a terrible mistake.</td></tr>

<p>The Chairman releases numerous Mantis droids around the Comms. Temple and begins annihilating both Chorus troopers and Space Pirates left and right, saying if he is going down then he is taking them all with him. With Wash, Carolina, Kimball, and the rest of the Feds and Rebels forced to take cover, the Reds and Blues contemplate a way to shut down the robots. Epsilon states that they must reach the Staff of Charon in order to override the Mantises' controls. So, in order to get inside the ship, the crew board Locus and Felix's damaged Falcon and fly it towards the Staff of Charon. After successfully getting inside, the crew search around the ship's engine room for the override controls, and soon discover F.I.L.S.S. F.I.L.S.S. explains that she was recovered by Hargrove and was illegally reassigned to work under him. When Epsilon pleads for her to shut down the Mantises, F.I.L.S.S., despite the action violating Hargrove's orders, gladly agrees to help, due to her deep dislike for the Chairman. Unfortunately, Hargrove stops F.I.L.S.S. from deactivating the droids and sends his own forces to attack the crew, prompting them to flee. As Hargrove's forces corner the crew, F.I.L.S.S. uses the ship's blast doors to protect them. She then directs the Reds and Blues to the location of the terminal containing the override controls: the Chairman's trophy room.

As Epsilon gets to work on overriding the controls, Hargrove, speaking to the two from the ship's bridge, admonishes that the crew will not leave the ship alive. Tucker, however, remains unfazed and shuts down the Mantises after Epsilon finishes overriding the controls. After the Mantises all shut down outside, the Feds and Rebels rejoice.

Epsilon contacts Carolina demanding an extraction, in which Carolina states that they will fire up a Pelican to pick them up in a few minutes. Unfortunately, Hargrove's forces immediately begin welding through the door, shortening the crew's time to make their escape. As a result, the Reds and Blues bravely prepare themselves for the oncoming attack, with Grif arming himself with his Brute shot, Lopez, Doc, and Donut barricading the door, and Simmons attempting to start up the Monitor. Tucker, concerned, asks Epsilon if they can win, but the latter explains that they still need one more piece. Having discovered it while overriding the Mantis controls, Epsilon has F.I.L.S.S. release the Meta's modified suit and asks Tucker to put it on. After Tucker dons the suit, Hargove's forces prepare to breach into the room. In response, the Blood Gulch Crew say their goodbyes to one another and ready themselves for the impending attack. Epsilon then states that out of everyone he's met he hates the crew the least, in which Tucker responds saying that he'll see him on the other side. Suddenly, time slows down, with Epsilon assuring that he will not make it back. Epsilon-Delta soon appears and asks Epsilon if he really wants to go through with this, in which Epsilon ensures that he does. Epsilon then begins a recording and says his final goodbyes to the Reds and Blues before dematerializing for good:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p>
"Hey guys... if you're hearing this then it means you did it. You won. You kicked the shit out of Hargrove's forces. I knew you could. But this is my last stop. See, when I came into this world, I was really just a collection of somebody else's memories. But with your help, these memories... they-they took form! They became my voice, my personality. And, after a while, I... I began to make brand new memories of my own. All of these things are what make me who I am... but they're also holding me back. I can't run this suit as Epsilon, but if I erase my memories, if I... deconstruct myself, the fragments I'll leave behind will have the strength to get you through this. I believe that. I wish that there was another way. But, I'm leaving this message as well as others, in the hopes that you'll understand why I have to go this time...hehe, it was actually Doyle who made me realize something that I've never thought of before. There are so many stories where some brave hero decides to give their life to save the day, and because of their sacrifice, the good guys win, the survivors all cheer, and everybody lives happily ever after. But the hero... never gets to see that ending. They'll never know if their sacrifice actually made a difference. They'll never know if the day was really saved. In the end, they just have to have faith. Ain't that a bitch." After he gives his speech to the team he deconstructs himself.</td></tr>
