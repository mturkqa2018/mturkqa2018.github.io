<p><b>Wilmington International Airport</b> (IATA: <b>ILM</b>, ICAO: <b>KILM</b>, FAA LID: <b>ILM</b>) is a public airport located just north of Wilmington, North Carolina, in unincorporated Wrightsboro, Cape Fear Township, New Hanover County. ILM covers 1,800 acres (728 ha).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>During the calendar year 2018 ILM had a record high number of passengers with 470,255 enplanements and 463,803 deplanements, totaling 934,058 passengers. The airport has two runways and a single terminal which has eight gates. The airport is also home to a fixed-base operation (FBO). There is a 24-hour US Customs and Border Protection ramp for international flights wishing to stop at the airport. The separate terminal was built to serve the international flights that land each year (private or charter).  The airport's location on the coast, halfway between NYC and Miami, makes it a desirable and less busy entry point to the United States, with the recent addition of a 24-hour US Customs ramp, which was completed in 2008.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Wilmington International Airport is owned by New Hanover County, North Carolina. The airport is leased to the Wilmington Airport Authority for $1 per year and expires in 2019.  The current Airport Director is Julie WIlsey, AAE.  The New Hanover County Airport Authority has seven board members, appointed by the New Hanover County Commissioners.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The airport was named <b>Bluethenthal Field</b> on Memorial Day, May 30, 1928, in honor of Arthur Bluethenthal, a former All-American football player and decorated World War I pilot who was the first North Carolinian to die in the war.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>During World War II, the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces Third Air Force for antisubmarine patrols and training using P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft. The Army expanded the airfield with three new 7,000-foot runways, and after the war, deeded the site back to New Hanover County at no cost.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In the 1950s the airport became known as the New Hanover County Airport. In 1988 the airport added "International" to become known as New Hanover County International Airport. On December 17, 1997 the New Hanover County Airport Authority changed the name to Wilmington International Airport.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Piedmont Airlines began commercial flights to Wilmington in February 1948, and used Wilmington as one of its initial crew bases. Its first route was between Wilmington and Cincinnati, Ohio, with stops in Pinehurst, Charlotte, Asheville, the Tri-Cities and Lexington. Piedmont was the airport's only scheduled carrier as of 1975, with flights to Atlanta, Fayetteville, Jacksonville, Kinston, Myrtle Beach, New Bern, Norfolk and Washington-National, using YS-11, FH-227 and Boeing 737 aircraft. Piedmont was acquired by USAir in 1989; USAir was renamed US Airways in 2005, and merged with American Airlines in 2015.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In addition to flights to its main regional hub at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, US Airways introduced three daily flights between Wilmington and La Guardia Airport in New York City during the 2000s following lobbying from the Wilmington community. US Airways also introduced nonstop service to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in March 2011. American Eagle began service between Wilmington and Chicago O'Hare International Airport in July 2011 after the airport authority offered two years of waived fees and marketing cost sharing. This route had been actively sought by the local business community for its connections to the West Coast and to Asia. The route was discontinued on April 2, 2012, but reinstated in early 2018 after the US Airways merger.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>ILM was one of four airports along the East Coast which served as an emergency abort landing site for the Space Shuttle. Improvements in the orbiter's braking system reduced the previous 10,000-foot (3,000 m) runway requirement to 7,500 feet (2,300 m) enabling ILM's 8,016-foot (2,443 m) runway to serve the role. ILM has also been used for touch-and-go training flights by United States Air Force VIP aircraft, including the Boeing VC-25 (Air Force One), C-32 and C-40.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Superfund_site">Superfund site</span></h3>
<p>A 1,500-square-foot (140 m) burn pit on the airport property was named a Superfund site on March 31, 1989. The burn pit was built in 1968 and was used until 1979 for firefighter training missions. Jet fuel, gasoline, petroleum storage tank bottoms, fuel oil, kerosene, and sorbent materials from oil spill cleanups were burned in the pit. Up to 500 gallons of fuel and other chemicals were used during each firefighting training exercise. The firefighters in the training missions mainly used water to put out the fires, but carbon dioxide and other dry chemicals were also used. The soil and groundwater was found to have multiple contaminants, including benzene, ethylbenzene, total xylene, 2-methylnaphthalene, phenanthrene, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, and chromium. The site has finished environmental remediation, and the last five-year review for the site was completed in August 2013. According to the EPA the site has been unlisted from the national priority list.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accidents_and_incidents">Accidents and incidents</span></h3>
<ul><li>On August 22, 1962, a Piedmont Airlines Martin 4-0-4 swerved off the runway at ILM during a training flight. All three occupants survived but the aircraft was written off.</li>
<li>On October 4, 1975, a twin-engine Cessna 310 piloted by 28 year old Vietnam vet Joseph Michael Farkas and arriving from Charlotte, NC crashed short of the field after running out of fuel.  The flight was carrying as passengers Professional Wrestling promotor David Crockett and wrestlers Tim Woods, Bobby Bruggers, then-U.S. Heavyweight champion Johnny Valentine, and Ric Flair.  The pilot died after a two-month stay in New Hanover Regional Hospital, all passengers survived with various injuries.</li>
<li>On April 23, 1987, a Swearingen Metro II operating a cargo flight for Air-Lift Commuter suffered an engine failure on takeoff at ILM and crashed, killing both occupants.</li>
<li>On May 4, 1990, a GAF Nomad arriving from Raleigh-Durham crashed on approach to runway 34, killing both occupants.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Airlines_and_destinations">Airlines and destinations</span></h2>
<p>As of 2019, ILM has scheduled service to eight destinations. Most commercial flights are operated with Bombardier and Embraer regional jet aircraft, but American operates Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft on the Wilmington-Charlotte route, and Delta operates MD-88 And Airbus A320 aircraft on the Wilmington-Atlanta route. American offered summer seasonal service to Dallas/Fort Worth in 2018 and commenced daily nonstop service to DFW in December 2018.

<p>Wilmington International Airport is undergoing many improvements and additions to attract more business to the Airport and to improve the experience of passenger's travels. The Airport has built a new terminal to be used by United States Customs and Border Protection to process passengers from international flights. Wilmington International has also built a new Visual Approach Slope Indicator ILS for Runway 24. The Airport has recently upgraded its outdated ventilation system with a new, more efficient system in the main terminal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In 2006, the FAA Airport Improvement Program awarded Wilmington International Airport $10,526,342. $3 million was allocated to improve runway safety areas and $7,526,342 was allocated to expand the Airports apron area, rehabilitate Runway 6/24, and rehabilitate Taxiways B, C, and E. Runway 6/24 had not been rehabilitated in more than 30 years. Rehabilitation of Runway 17/35 was completed in 2014, and the project was honored with the Ray Brown Airport Pavement Award, which recognizes the highest-quality U.S. airfield pavement produced each year.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>With passenger numbers continuing to grow rapidly, the airport began an $86 Million terminal expansion project in 2018. The project is divided into three phases. Phase 1 reconstruct's the TSA and DHS baggage screening facilities, and will largely be unseen by passengers. Phase 1 began construction in Summer 2018, and is expected to be complete in March 2019. Phase 2 will expand the ticketing areas and airport offices. Construction for Phase 2 is expected to begin in March 2019 and be complete in March 2020. Phase 3 will involve renovating and expanding the concourse to include more gates. Phase 3 is scheduled to begin in Fall 2019 and be complete in Early 2022.
