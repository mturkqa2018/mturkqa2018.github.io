<p>American rock band Evanescence has released four studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one demo album, three extended plays, 13 singles, six promotional singles, and 13 music videos. Evanescence was formed in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by Amy Lee and Ben Moody. The lineup of the band has since gone through numerous changes with Lee being the principal member. To date, the band has sold nearly 25 million albums worldwide.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The earliest of Evanescence's material was released in the late 1990s through independent label Bigwig Enterprises, beginning with their self-titled EP in 1998, followed by the <i>Sound Asleep</i> EP the following year. The band recorded and released a demo album in 2000, titled <i>Origin</i>, and sold it at their concert venues. Very few copies of <i>Origin</i> were pressed, and soon went on sale for high prices online.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The band signed to Wind-up Records in January 2001. In early 2003, the band released the <i>Mystary</i> EP, with their debut full-length album <i>Fallen</i> following in March. In the United States, <i>Fallen</i> sold 141,000 copies in its first week, and was met with critical acclaim. It spawned the singles "Bring Me to Life", "Going Under", "My Immortal", and "Everybody's Fool". "Bring Me to Life" and "My Immortal" peaked in the top ten in several countries, and respectively were certified Platinum and Gold by the RIAA. The album peaked at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and went on to sell more than 17 million units worldwide. <i>Fallen</i> was certified seven times platinum by the RIAA, and it has sold over 7.8 million units in the United States to date. The success of the album and its singles earned the band two Grammy Awards (for Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance) at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004. While touring in support of <i>Fallen</i>, the band recorded their performance in Paris. The full concert performance was released as a live album in November 2004, titled <i>Anywhere but Home</i>. The record was certified Gold in the United States, and it has sold over 687,000 units in the United States. <i>Anywhere but Home</i> has sold over 1.5 million units worldwide.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Their second album, <i>The Open Door</i>, was released in October 2006 and debuted at number one on four national charts, including the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling over 447,000 copies in its first week in the United States. <i>The Open Door</i> spawned four singles.  The lead single, "Call Me When You're Sober", attained chart success similar to "Bring Me to Life" and "My Immortal", and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. "Call Me When You're Sober" was followed by the singles "Lithium" and "Sweet Sacrifice", and both received minor chart success. "Sweet Sacrifice" earned a nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards in 2008 for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost to the Foo Fighters' "The Pretender". A fourth single, "Good Enough", was also released, but it did not chart. <i>The Open Door</i> has sold over five million units worldwide. It has sold 2.1 million units in the United States, and has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p><i>Evanescence</i>, their third studio album, was released in October 2011. It debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, where its US sales had reached 127,000 copies in its first week. It also peaked in the top five in seven other countries. The first single, "What You Want", was released in August, attaining moderate chart success. The second single, "My Heart Is Broken", was released in October. The last single from the album, "Lost in Paradise", was released in May 2012, and "The Other Side" followed as a promotional single the following month. By August 2012, <i>Evanescence</i> had sold over 421,000 copies in the US.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Their fourth album, <i>Synthesis</i>, was released in November 2017. It debuted at number 8 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and has reached number 5 in Germany, 6 in Australia and 23 in the UK.
