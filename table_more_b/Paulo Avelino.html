<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In 2008, he appeared in a supporting role in <i>Babangon Ako't Dudurugin Kita</i>, a remake of the 1989 movie of the same title redeveloped by Don Michael Perez and produced by GMA Network.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2011-12:_Transfer_to_ABS-CBN_and_breakthrough">2011-12: Transfer to ABS-CBN and breakthrough</span></h3>
<p>In 2011, Avelino signed a contract with ABS-CBN in the presence of channel head Cory Vidanes, business unit head Deo Endrinal and his manager Leo Dominguez. According to ABS-CBN News, Avelino said he wanted to explore out of his comfort zone and, at the same time, reinvent himself as an actor. Avelino debuted as a lead actor in a film alongside Lovi Poe on Regal Films' <i>Aswang</i>, which marked his first project as a Kapamilya actor. He acted in a film titled <i>Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow</i>, an entry to the 2011 Metro Manila Film Festival. He appeared for the first time in an ABS-CBN show through a guest role in <i>100 Days to Heaven</i>. He appeared as a rich executive named Teddy Ledesma, alongside veteran actor Phillip Salvador. He also appeared in <i>Wansapanataym</i>, <i>Maalaala Mo Kaya</i> and <i>Ikaw Ay Pag-Ibig</i> as a warm up for his future projects.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Avelino played the role of a bisexual in the 2011 Cinemalaya film <i>Ang Sayaw ng Dalawang Kaliwang Paa</i> alongside Rocco Nacino, wherein he won as Best Actor at the Gawad Urian Awards. This marked the actor's first ever award. In his speech, he thanked the movie's cast and crew and said the award would be an inspiration to him. According to him, "When I first accepted the script, to be honest, I didnâ€™t understand it... Itâ€™s mostly poems or songs. Itâ€™s something really different, and thatâ€™s the reason why I accepted it." In 2012, Avelino achieved his biggest break through a major role in the hit primetime series <i>Walang Hanggan</i>, alongside Coco Martin and Julia Montes. He revealed that he learned a lot from his multi-awarded co-actor Martin, who played the lead role. In the same year, Avelino once again appeared in 2012 Metro Manila Film Festival through "Lost Command" episode of a famous horror trilogy <i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll 14</i> produced by Regal Films. According to him, he considers doing horror projects a little more challenging compared to doing drama.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Aside from movie and television acting, Avelino became a recording artist releasing his self-titled album under Universal Records on October 1, 2012. <i>Paulo Avelino</i> is composed of six-tracks covers of OPM classic hits. The album was preceded by the first single, a cover of Restless Heart's "When She Cries". Avelino released a music video for his second single, a cover of Alamid's "Your Love". Other tracks included "Gaano Kadalas Ang Minsan", "Yakap Sa Dilim", "Bakit Labis Kitang Mahal" and "If You Believe".

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2013-present:_Recent_and_future_projects">2013-present: Recent and future projects</span></h3>
<p>Avelino started the year 2013 in the pre-primetime series <i>Kahit Konting Pagtingin</i>, together with Angeline Quinto and Sam Milby.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>He appeared on two independent films for Cinemalaya. The first was directed by Alvin Yapan and was titled <i>Debosyon</i>. He explained that he signed up on the film because of the surreal and magical treatment of the story about faith, religion and forbidden love. The dialogue is written in very poetic Bicolano. The other one was directed by Jerrold Tarog titled as <i>Sana Dati</i>, a bizarre story of a videographer and a bride.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>He appeared as leading man of actresses Lovi Poe and Jennylyn Mercado on a highly charged erotic-drama romantic comedy film directed by Joel Lamangan, <i>The Bride and the Lover</i>.

Avelino did a tandem to Locsin after reports surfaced that he allegedly refused to work with the actress. He had backed out of Locsin's upcoming series <i>The Legal Wife</i> (formerly <i>Hanggang Kailan Kita Mamahalin</i>) which they were supposed to headline. Avelino appeared in a lead role in the family drama series <i>Honesto</i>, wherein he reunited with his <i>Walang Hanggan</i> co-stars Melissa Ricks and Noni Buencamino. He also appeared on a romantic-comedy film directed by Chris Martinez titled <i>Status: It's Complicated</i>, with Jake Cuenca, Solenn Heussaff, Maja Salvador, and veteran comedian Eugene Domingo. The movie is inspired and remaked by the 1979 classic sexy-comedy film <i>Salawahan</i> directed by Ishmael Bernal. In the 2013 Metro Manila Film Festival, he appeared in two entries: a lead role on Star Cinema's horror film <i>Pagpag</i> and a cameo in <i>Kimmy Dora: The Quantum of Kiyeme</i>.
