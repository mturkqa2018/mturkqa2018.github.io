<p><i><b>Project Runway</b></i> is an American reality television series that focuses on fashion design. The contestants compete with each other to create the best clothes and are restricted by time, materials and theme.  Their designs are judged by a panel, and one or more designers are typically eliminated from the show each week. During each season, contestants are progressively eliminated until only a few contestants remain. These finalists prepare a complete fashion collection for New York Fashion Week, which determines the winner.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p><i>Project Runway</i> was created by Eli Holzman and was hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum. It has a varied airing history, with Bravo originating the first five seasons, followed by Lifetime for eleven more, before it was announced on May 14, 2018 that the series is tentatively returning to Bravo for the seventeenth season in the wake of The Weinstein Company's bankruptcy, pending TWC asset winner Lantern Entertainment's acquisition of the former TWC assets. The show won a Peabody Award in 2008 "for using the 'television reality contest' genre to engage, inform, enlighten and entertain." On September 7, 2018, it was confirmed that Heidi Klum and the show's mentor Tim Gunn would not be returning for a 17th season on Bravo as they both signed a deal to helm another fashion competition show on Amazon Video.

<p><i>Project Runway</i> uses progressive elimination to reduce the initial field of 12 or more fashion designers down to three or four before the final challenge. Each non-finale challenge (the scope of one episode) requires the designers to develop one or more pieces of new clothing to be presented at a runway show. The challenges range in creative diversity to test the designers' ingenuity while maintaining their personal fashion design aesthetic. These challenges may include creating a garment from non-traditional materials, such as: apartment furnishings (Season 3), recyclable materials (Season 3), items from a grocery store (Seasons 1 &amp; 5), edible food items (Seasons 1, 4 &amp; 10), plants and flowers (Season 2), using their own clothes that they happened to be wearing (Seasons 2 &amp; 9), designing clothing with materials from a party store (season 8)Â ; or designing for a certain high-profile person (such as actress Brooke Shields, figure skater Sasha Cohen or Miss USA Tara Conner); or designing for a corporate fashion line (e.g., Banana Republic; Diane von FÃ¼rstenberg; Macy's; or Sarah Jessica Parker's Bitten); or centered on a specialized theme (such as "cocktail party", "wedding gown", "female wrestling outfit", or "prom dress").

<p>The first several seasons were filmed in New York City, at The New School University's Parsons The New School for Design. They shop for materials at a fabric store in New York's Garment District (usually at <i>MOOD Designer Fabrics</i>)Â â€“ unless the challenge requires otherwise (e.g., denim jackets and jeans from Levi's, confectionery and souvenirs at the Hershey's Store in Times Square, or fabric at <i>Spandex House</i> in Season 4). The designers live together, grouped by gender, at Atlas New York (an apartment building near Parsons) during Seasons 1â€“3 (back again at Season 5) and at New Gotham during Season 4. Along with the network change to Lifetime, the location changed from New York to Los Angeles for Season 6 only (permanently returning to New York for Season 7.)  While on the show, the designers are prohibited from leaving the apartments without authorization, making unauthorized communication with family or friends, or using the Internet to research designs. Designers are also forbidden to bring pattern books or similar how-to materials with them during the show, or risk being disqualified from the competition (as was the case of Keith Michael in Season 3 and of Claire Buitendorp in Season 16).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The designers are given a budgeted stipend to select and purchase fabric and notions, and then provided a limited amount of time to finish their designs (the shortest being 5 hours and the longest being two or three days, with the exception of fashion week when they are given 12 weeks). Often, the designers work independently, although on some challenges, contestants must work in teams or as a single collective group. Once the deadline is reached, the designers must dress their models and select their hair, make-up, and accessories. Each model walks down the runway, and the garment the contestant made is rated by a panel of judges, who score each look in several categories from 0 to 5, and often provide personal annotations and comments regarding the presented designs. Each contestant does a voice-over while the model is walking down the runway. The judges then interview the remaining designers (usually six) who garnered the highest and the lowest scores (usually a top 3 and a bottom 3), and share their opinions while listening to the designers' defense of their outfits, then confer as a group in private. The panel then announces the winning and losing designers based on their scores and other considerations. Typically, the winner receives immunity for the next challenge, and therefore cannot be eliminated. As the season progresses, immunity is disregarded during later challenges to prevent the designers from getting an easy pass to make it into the final round. Other incentives given to the contestants aside from winning immunity include:  The winning garment may be featured in print media, integrated into a limited edition look for a particular clothing brand, or sold at an online fashion store (e.g., BlueFly.com beginning in Season 4 onwards). Generally, the loser of each challenge is eliminated from the competition, with host Klum giving him or her a double air kiss on the runway and wishing the eliminated designer farewell her catchphrase, <i>Auf Wiedersehen</i> (formal German for goodbye with literal translation "until we meet again"), before they depart. Thus, elimination from the show is sometimes called "being auf'd"â€”a play on words as it can be interpreted as offedâ€”and designers who receive an unusually large amount of camera time, solely to lay a predicate for their elimination from the show, are occasionally described as receiving "the 'auf' edit."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>After the final challenge, the remaining three designers are then told to prepare a complete fashion collection of twelve looks to be presented at New York Fashion Week in Bryant Park. The finalists are given 12 weeks and $8,000 for this task, which they perform at their own homes or studios. While some construction work can be outsourced, the majority of the garments must be created by the designers themselves. Prior to the show, the finalists must return to New York City to oversee model casting, hair and make-up consultations, finishing touches to their clothes, final fitting on their models, and possibly an additional challenge, such as designing another outfit to blend in with the collection (as in Seasons 2, 5, 6 and 8). Their receipts are also handed over to the producers of the show to determine if they went over budget or had outsourcing done as favors, both of which are against the rules. If rules are violated, they may be forced to eliminate a crucial aesthetic factor in their presentation (e.g., Jeffrey Sebelia's blond wigs and pleated leather shorts in Season 3); or the judging panel might lower their scoring, if they insist upon using a forbidden item (e.g., Kara Saun's outsourced footwear in Season 1). The ultimate winner is selected by the judges, and receives $100,000 to start their own design line, a feature spread in <i>Marie Claire</i> magazine, and a mentorship from a design firm (ended on Season 3). The winner is also given the optional opportunity to sell their collection on bluefly.com. Subsequent seasons have also included a new car as part of the prize package. Prior to its 2009 dissolution, the automobile company Saturn furnished the winners' vehicles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Female fashion models, who work with the designers throughout the season, are also in the competition. Each week, as the number of designers dwindles, the number of models is also reduced. Models are randomly pre-assigned to a designer during the first challenge, but from the second challenge onwards, the designers are able to choose the model with whom they wish to work. During weekly model eliminations, the models stand on a runway with Klum, in front of the seated group of designers. The models appear by wearing the same outfit (black dress and barefoot). The designers then pick their models in sequence, based upon their respective scores in the previous design competition.  Originally, model selection happened at the start of every episode save for the first. The winner of the previous challenge receiving first pick, and the other designers picking models in order through Klum's random draw of large red shirt buttons with their names stored in a black velvet bag. However, there were times when only the winning designer was given the choice to pick with the following choices: either keep their previous model, take the losing designer's model from the last challenge, or switch models with another competing designer. Beginning with Season 6, model selection appears on a companion program, <i>Models of the Runway</i>, usually near the end of that show.  At the end of the weekly model selection process, the one unpicked model is sent home.  This losing model is also given host Klum's air kiss and <i>Auf Wiedersehen</i> before leaving the runway. Included in the prize package for the winning model is coverage in <i>Elle</i> magazine, featuring the winning designer's twelve-piece collection as part of her prize. However, certain challenges may not require the models at all, such as: giving a competing designer a head-to-toe makeover (Seasons 2 and 5), designers creating their own looks (Season 3), designing menswear (Season 4), or creating a garment for a specific client (e.g., reconstructed outfits for women who lost weight, or wrestling costumes for the WWE Divas in Season 4). Airing of the model selection ended starting Season 8.

<p>Joining Klum in judging duties are American top designer Michael Kors, <i>Marie Claire</i> fashion director Nina Garcia, and a fourth guest judge, usually a fashion designer, a supermodel, a celebrity, or a professional from an industry related to the challenge given. Tim Gunn, former Chair of the Fashion School at Parsons The New School for Design and now Chief Creative Officer for Liz Claiborne Inc., co-hosts the show along with Klum and acts as a mentor to the designers, giving them suggestions and tips for their designs throughout the episode, but he does not participate in the judging. Zac Posen became a regular judge on the show at the beginning of the eleventh season, as Kors was unable to participate due to scheduling conflicts. Throughout the eleventh season, Rachel Roy alternated with Posen when he couldn't commit to being a judge for a particular episode.

<p>On July 4, 2006, the show's producers, The Weinstein Company, announced a five-year deal that would relocate the show to Lifetime, beginning with Season 6. In response, NBCUniversal filed a lawsuit against the Weinstein Company for violating its contract rights. A September 2008 court decision granted NBCU's request for an injunction, preventing Lifetime from promoting or exhibiting "Runway" until further notice.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>On April 1, 2009, the lawsuit between The Weinstein Company and NBCUniversal was settled, with Weinstein agreeing to pay NBC an undisclosed sum for the right to move the show to Lifetime. Season 6 began airing on Lifetime on August 20, 2009. On August 27, 2009, NBC Universal wound up gaining partial ownership of Lifetime, when A&amp;E Television Networks, which was already partially owned by NBC, acquired the channel's parent company, Lifetime Entertainment Services. It premiered on the Slice channel in Canada on September 12.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Following the show's sixteenth season, NBC reacquired the rights to the show, as a result of the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Company; Weinstein Company's assets, which including <i>Project Runway</i>, were acquired by Lantern Entertainment in March 2018, and by May 2018, NBC's Bravo Media LLC. NBC announced in May 2018 that the show would move back to Bravo as a reboot of the series. By September 2018, host Heidi Klum and mentor Tim Gunn announced they were leaving <i>Project Runway</i> to start a new reality competition show for Amazon Studios; judge Zac Posen also stated he was leaving the show. By October 2018, Bravo announced that Klum and Gunn would be replaced, respectively, by supermodel Karlie Kloss and the winner of Season 4, Christian Siriano. Additionally, fashion designer Brandon Maxwell and former <i>Teen Vogue</i> editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth were joining Nina Garcia as permanent judges.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Season_1">Season 1</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Further information: Project Runway (season 1)</div>
<p><i>Project Runway</i> premiered its first season on December 1, 2004, featuring 12 designers. Heidi Klum, Michael Kors and Nina Garcia served as judges while Tim Gunn, fashion chair at Parsons The New School for Design, served as the mentor for the designers. During this season, <i>Project Runway</i> received critical acclaim, including an Emmy nomination for outstanding competitive reality series. Growth in audience popularity was also dramatic from its debut to the season finale, making it a sleeper hit. <i>Project Runway</i> gave Bravo one of its most successful series since <i>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Pennsylvania-based designer Jay McCarroll won the competition with his model Julia Beynon. Kara Saun and her model Jenny Toth placed second, while Wendy Pepper and her model Melissa Haro placed third. Austin Scarlett won the fan favorite award. As his prize for winning the competition, McCarroll was eligible to receive a $100,000 cash prize, a mentorship with Banana Republic to aid in developing his own fashion label (both of which he turned down), and display of his work in the American edition of <i>Elle</i> magazine.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Austin Scarlett produced a decoy collection for Fashion Week after being eliminated in the controversial <i>"Nancy O'Dell Grammy Challenge"</i>, causing outrage among fans. His appearance at Fashion Week was an 11th hour decision made by the show's producers who were concerned that the identity of the three finalists would be revealed before the Project Runway Season 1 finale aired. The ploy was later adopted for the show's succeeding seasons.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In 2008, Jay McCarroll, in conjunction with Here! Films released the feature-length documentary "Eleven Minutes".  The feature documentary chronicles his year-long post Project Runway journey preparing his first independent runway show for New York's Fashion Week in Bryant Park and the subsequent selling of his line to stores.  Also in 2008, Jay McCarroll launched his own online fashion boutique, <i>The Colony</i>.

<p>The third season premiered on July 12, 2006, featuring 15 designers. Heidi Klum, Michael Kors, Nina Garcia and Tim Gunn all returned for the third season. This season introduced a new set of sponsors, notably Macy's replacing Banana Republic, in advance of Macy's conversion of former May Company department stores.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The season finale aired on October 18, 2006. Mychael Knight was the first to be eliminated in the season finale for his collection titled "Street Safari." Knight was a fan favorite, but his line did not appeal to the judges. In a "Reunion" episode that aired on October 4, 2006, viewers voted Mychael Knight as their favorite designer, earning him a $10,000 prize. Laura Bennett was the second eliminated for her collection of cocktail dresses and evening wear, though the judges praised her for how expensive her items looked. During taping, Bennett found out she was pregnant with her sixth child. Jeffrey Sebelia was voted the winner by the judges. Uli Herzner was the runner-up and was also highly praised by the judges for her collection. Sebelia's girlfriend and son were there to celebrate his win with him. Jeffrey's model, Marilinda Rivera, won the <i>Elle</i> fashion editorial featuring his winning designs at Fashion Week, over fellow models Nazri Segaro (for Uli Herzner), Camilla Barungi (for Laura Bennett) and Clarissa Anderson (for Mychael Knight).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>There were many dramatic scenes which played out this season. Designer Keith Michael became the first designer to be asked to leave the show for multiple rule violations. He was found to be in possession of prohibited pattern-making books and left the production site for several hours, during which time he used the internet. Sebelia was accused of having outside help to finish his garments by fellow competitor Laura Bennett. The issue was investigated, and it was declared that he had followed the guidelines. Because he could not produce a receipt for a pair of leather shorts he had sent out for pleating, he removed that item from the show.  In addition, because he had gone over budget by $227.95, he removed the blonde wigs he had planned for his runway models in order to drop below budget. Also, for the first time, the last four designers were selected as finalists (Jeffrey Sebelia, Laura Bennett, Ulrike "Uli" Herzner, and Mychael Knight), with no decoy collection to serve as a distraction before the finale aired, and allowed to compete at New York Fashion Week.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>During Season 3, there was a poll consisting of the most memorable moments of <i>Project Runway</i>.  Among the most notable were Keith's disqualification, Sebelia's issues with competitor Angela Kesler's mother, and the controversy about Sebelia's final collection.

In a new finale twist, Rami Kashou and Chris March, the bottom 2 of the last challenge, had to show the three best pieces from their collections to the judges.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>Kathleen "Sweet P." Vaughn, the last designer eliminated before the finale, produced a decoy collection for Fashion Week, along with Chris March. Siriano won $10,000 as the Project Runway Season 4 Fan Favorite.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Season 5 had a series poll consisting the 22 most memorable moments of <i>Project Runway</i>.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Further information: Project Runway (season 5)</div>
<p>The fifth season premiered on July 16, 2008, at its new time of 9/8c on Bravo, featuring 16 designers. Heidi Klum, Michael Kors, Nina Garcia and Tim Gunn all returned for the fifth season.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>This first episode was the first time that they repeated a challenge from a previous season: the Gristedes challenge, in which the designers had to make a design of their choice using what they could find at a grocery store. The episode, featuring a special guest judge appearance by first season competitor Austin Scarlett, was intended as an homage to the glories of past seasons, the fifth season being the last on Bravo and by original producers Magical Elves.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Similar to season 4, four designers were chosen to prepare collections for Fashion Week, but only three proceeded on in the competition to show their collections at Fashion Week. However, unlike the previous season, the last challenge does not have a bearing on this decision and any of the four remaining designers could be eliminated before fashion week.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>For the first time, six people showed collections for Fashion Week. Joe Faris and Stephen "Suede" Baum, the last two designers eliminated, and Jerell Scott, who was eliminated in the first part of the finale, showed decoy collections.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>For the first time, all of the finalists (Kenley Collins, Korto Momolu and Leanne Marshall) were female. All three collections were well received. Kenley was praised for her well-tailored designs, but was eliminated first because some of her designs were reminiscent of other professional designers' collections.  The judges admired Korto's ethnic touches on her designs, but thought that a few were overworked.  Leanne was declared the winner for her wave patterns. Her model, Tia Shipman, won the <i>Elle</i> fashion editorial featuring her winning designs at Fashion Week, over fellow models Katarina Munez (for Korto Momolu) and Topacio Pena (for Kenley Collins). Jennifer Lopez was supposed to be the guest judge in the finale, but bowed out at the last minute, so Tim Gunn took her place.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>For the first time since Season 1, there was no reunion or opening introduction due to time restraints.  However, Bravo continued to stage the fan favorite contest, with Momulu winning.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>The sixth season had been announced to begin airing in January 2009 on Lifetime, but was delayed due to legal issues. The announcement occurred before NBC Universal sought preliminary injunctive action effectively enjoining production. The launch was further delayed due to Lifetime's request that the suit between NBC Universal and The Weinstein Co. be removed to federal court. On April 1, 2009, the lawsuit between Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal was settled, with Weinstein agreeing to pay NBC an undisclosed sum for the right to move the show to Lifetime.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>The premiere was preceded by a two-hour special episode of Project Runway: All-Star Challenge where eight past contestants (Daniel Vosovic, Santino Rice, Jeffrey Sebelia, Uli Herzner, Mychael Knight, Chris March, Sweet P, and Korto Momolu) competed in one challenge with a cash prize of $100,000. Vosovic won the challenge, while Momolu came in second place, Sweet P in third, and March in fourth.
