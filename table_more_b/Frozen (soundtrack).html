<p>As of December 11, 2014, the soundtrack for <i>Frozen</i> had had forty-three nonconsecutive weeks on top of <i>Billboard</i> Top Soundtracks. On the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, the album debuted at #18, the highest chart position for the soundtrack in an animated film since the 2006 film <i>Cars</i>. It later moved up to #10, becoming the tenth soundtrack from an animated film to reach top 10. The soundtrack subsequently moved to #4, which is the highest position for an animated film soundtrack since Disney's <i>Pocahontas</i> in 1995. In the week ending January 5, 2014, <i>Frozen</i> reached No. 1, surpassing Beyoncé's self-titled album (which had previously held the No. 1 position for three weeks after its unannounced release in December 2013) to become the fourth animated film soundtrack in history to reach this position. It remained at number one for a second consecutive week, becoming the first theatrical film soundtrack to stay at No. 1 for multiple weeks since <i>Dreamgirls</i> (also featuring Beyoncé) in early 2007, and the first animated film to spend more than one week at No. 1 since Disney's <i>The Lion King</i> in 1994 and 1995. With thirteen non-consecutive weeks at number one, <i>Frozen</i> earned the most weeks at No. 1 for an album since Adele's <i>21</i> (24 weeks) and the most weeks at No. 1 for a soundtrack since <i>Titanic</i> in 1998.
