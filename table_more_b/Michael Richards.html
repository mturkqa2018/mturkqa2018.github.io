<p><b>Michael Anthony Richards</b> (born July 24, 1949) is an American actor, writer, television producer and comedian, widely known for his portrayal of Cosmo Kramer on the television sitcom <i>Seinfeld</i>, for which he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series three times.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Richards began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on Billy Crystal's first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on ABC's <i>Fridays</i>. Prior to <i>Seinfeld</i>, he made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as <i>Cheers</i>. His film credits include <i>So I Married an Axe Murderer</i>, <i>Airheads</i>, <i>Young Doctors in Love</i>, <i>Problem Child</i>, <i>Coneheads</i>, <i>UHF</i>, and <i>Trial and Error</i>, one of his few starring roles. During the run of <i>Seinfeld</i>, he made a guest appearance in <i>Mad About You</i>. After <i>Seinfeld</i>, Richards starred in his own sitcom, <i>The Michael Richards Show</i>, which lasted less than one full season.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>When <i>Seinfeld</i> ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy. He incited media furor while performing at the Laugh Factory comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racist tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members. Subsequently due to significant media coverage of the event he announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007. He appeared as himself in the seventh season of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> in 2009, acting alongside his fellow cast members for the first time since <i>Seinfeld</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s finale, as well as lampooning his incident at the Laugh Factory. In 2013, Richards returned to television when he played the role of Frank in the sitcom <i>Kirstie</i>.

<p>Richards was born in Culver City, California, to a Catholic family. He is the son of Phyllis (née Nardozzi), a medical records librarian of Italian descent and William Richards, an electrical engineer of Scottish and English descent. His father died in a car crash when Michael was two and his mother never remarried.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Richards graduated from Thousand Oaks High School. In 1968, he appeared as a contestant on The Dating Game, however he was not chosen for the date. He was drafted into the United States Army in 1970. He trained as a medic and was stationed in West Germany. After being honorably discharged he used the benefits of the G.I. Bill to enroll in the California Institute of the Arts, and received a BA degree in drama from The Evergreen State College in 1975. He also had a short-lived improv act with Ed Begley, Jr.. During this period, he enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College and continued to appear in student productions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<p>Richards got his big TV break in 1979, appearing in Billy Crystal's first cable TV special. In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on ABC's <i>Fridays</i> television show, where Larry David was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest Andy Kaufman refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the cue cards on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke). The film <i>Man on the Moon</i> featured a re-enactment of the Andy Kaufman incident in which Richards was portrayed by actor Norm Macdonald (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In 1989, Richards had a supporting role in "Weird Al" Yankovic's comedy film <i>UHF</i> as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in <i>Miami Vice</i> (as an unscrupulous bookie), <i>Cheers</i> (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with Sam Malone), and made several guest appearances with Jay Leno as an accident-prone fitness expert.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>According to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series <i>Monk</i> as a procedural police comedy with an Inspector Clouseau-like character suffering from obsessive–compulsive disorder. Hoberman said that ABC wanted Richards to play Adrian Monk, but he turned it down.

<p>In 1989, he was cast as Cosmo Kramer in the NBC television series <i>Seinfeld</i>, which was created by fellow <i>Fridays</i> cast member Larry David and comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular sitcoms in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the Nielsen ratings. In the setting of <i>Seinfeld</i>, Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's eponymous character. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode "The Switch".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Richards won more Emmys than any other cast member on <i>Seinfeld</i>. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Starting in 2004, he and his fellow <i>Seinfeld</i> cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the <i>Seinfeld</i> DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season 5 though he continued to provide interviews.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Michael_Richards_Show"><i>The Michael Richards Show</i></span></h3>
<p>In 2000, after the end of <i>Seinfeld</i>, Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since <i>Seinfeld</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s finale. <i>The Michael Richards Show</i>, for which the actor received co-writer and co-executive producer credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2006_Laugh_Factory_incident">2006 Laugh Factory incident</span></h3>
<p>During a performance on November 17, 2006 at the Laugh Factory in Hollywood, California Richards shouted a racist response to reported heckling and being interrupted by a small group of black audience members, shouting "He's a nigger!" several times, and referring to lynching and the Jim Crow era. Kyle Doss, a member of the group Richards addressed, said that the group had arrived in the middle of the performance, explaining:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r886047036">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>[H]ere's what happened. As we walked in, we sat down and started ordering drinks. And, as we ordered drinks, I guess we're being a little loud, because there was 20 of us ordering drinks. And he said, "Look at the stupid Mexicans and blacks being loud up there." That's the first thing he said. And then he kept on with his bit. And, then, after a while, I told him, "My friend doesn't think you're funny." And then when I told him that, that's when he flipped me off and said, "F-you N-word." And that's how it all started.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><div class="templatequotecite">— <cite>Kyle Doss, Interview on <i>The Situation Room</i></cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Richards made a public apology when he spoke via satellite on the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, when Jerry Seinfeld was the guest, saying, "For me to be at a comedy club and to flip out and say this crap, I'm deeply, deeply sorry. I'm not a racist, that's what's so insane about this." The audience initially laughed at Richards using the terms "Afromerican" and "Afro Americans" and during uncomfortable pauses in Richards' explanation and apology, unable to decide if the interview was a bit; at one point Seinfeld chided the audience, "Stop laughing, it's not funny." Richards said that he had been trying to defuse heckling by being even more outrageous, but that it had backfired. He later called civil rights leaders Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to apologize. He also appeared as a guest on Jackson's syndicated radio show. However both Doss and Sharpton have refused to accept Richards' apology, with the former saying "...if he wanted to apologize, he could have contacted somebody to one of us from the group...but he didn't. He apologized on camera just because the tape got out."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The incident was later parodied on several TV shows, including <i>MadTV</i>, <i>Family Guy</i>, <i>South Park</i>, and <i>Extras</i>. In an episode of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, Richards appeared as himself and poked fun at the incident. In a 2012 episode of Seinfeld's web series <i>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</i>, Richards admitted that the outburst still haunted him, and was a major reason for his withdrawal from performing stand-up.
