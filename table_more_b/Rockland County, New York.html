<p><b>Rockland County</b> is the southernmost county on the west side of the Hudson River in the U.S. state of New York, part of the New York City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county's population, as of the 2010 census, was 311,687, increasing by 5.5% to a 2017 Census estimate of 328,868, making it the third-most densely populated county outside New York City within New York State (after Nassau and neighboring Westchester counties, respectively). The county seat is New City. Rockland County is a suburb of New York City that borders the boroughs about 9 miles northwest of the city at their closest points, and is accessible via the New York State Thruway, after 10 exits. The name derives from "rocky land", as the area has been aptly described.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Rockland County is the smallest county by area in New York State outside New York City. It comprises five towns and nineteen incorporated villages, with numerous unincorporated villages (sixteen) and hamlets. Rockland County is designated as a Preserve America Community, and roughly one-third of the county is parkland. The county has the largest Jewish population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31.4%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish. Rockland also ranks 9th on the list of highest-income counties by median household income in the United States with $75,306 according to the 2000 census. In 2015, Suffern was named as the best place to start a business in New York by NerdWallet. NerdWallet also included the villages of Haverstraw (73), West Haverstraw (76) and Spring Valley (83) in their report.

<p>The area that would become Rockland County was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Aboriginals, including Munsees, or Lenni Lenape.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In 1609, Henry Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary "Northwest Passage", sailed on the <i>Half Moon</i> up the river that would one day bear his name and anchored near the area that is now Haverstraw before continuing to disillusionment north of Albany.  The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675.  These settlers, eager to escape "city life", moved from Manhattan to Rockland.  A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.  When the Duke of York (who became King James II of England) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of Orange County, known then as <i>"Orange County South of the Mountains"</i>. Orangetown was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize Nyack and Tappan, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The natural barrier of the Ramapo Mountains and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Haverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day Clarkstown, Ramapo and Stony Point. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.

<p>During the American Revolution, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the British as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw skirmishes at Haverstraw, Nyack and Piermont, and significant military engagements at the Battle of Stony Point, where General "Mad" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname. George Washington had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of Suffern.  British Major John André met with American traitor Benedict Arnold near Stony Point to buy the plans for the fortifications at West Point. André was captured with the plans in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby.  Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received Sir Guy Carleton at the DeWint House, where they discussed the terms of the peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks.  These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve.  Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Hudson Highlands on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park became a reality in 1910, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Rockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s when the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Tappan Zee Bridge, and other major arteries were built.  The idea of suburbia also helped transform the county.  The county's population flourished, from 89,276 in 1950 to 265,475 in 1990.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 199 square miles (520 km), of which 174 square miles (450 km) is land and 26 square miles (67 km) (13%) is water. It is the smallest county in the state outside New York City.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Rockland County lies just north of the New Jersey-New York border, west of Westchester County across the Hudson River, and south of Orange County.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The county's elevations range from 1,283 feet (391 m) atop Rockhouse Mountain to sea level along the Hudson River.  Approximately 30% of Rockland County is devoted to parkland, belonging to either the five towns, incorporated villages, the state, or the county.  These parks provide walking and hiking trails, ballfields, dog runs, historic sites, ponds, streams, salt marshes, and equestrian trails.  Some popular state parks include Bear Mountain State Park on the northernmost tip of the county, Harriman State Park also along the county's northern boundary, and Nyack Beach State Park along the Hudson River, with trails connecting to Rockland Lake State Park.  In addition to parks, Rockland is home to numerous public and private golf courses, with the towns of Orangetown, Ramapo, Stony Point, and Haverstraw all operating public golf courses within their towns, offering discounted rates to their respective residents.  The Palisades Interstate Park Commission also operates two golf courses in Rockland Lake State Park with sweeping views of the park.  Notable private courses in the county include Paramount Country Club, Manhattan Woods Golf Course (designed by PGA great Gary Player), and Rockland Country Club (Sparkill).

<p>The county is served by several major highways, including Interstate 87/287 (the New York Thruway), opening from Suffern to Yonkers in 1955.  The Tappan Zee Bridge also opened the same year, finally connecting Rockland and Westchester, allowing the population in Rockland to grow rapidly over the next several decades.  The Palisades Interstate Parkway, built by master planner Robert Moses between 1947 and 1958, connects the county directly to the George Washington Bridge due south.  Another vital artery, the Garden State Parkway, opened in 1955, connecting New Jersey to I-87/287.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="County_courts">County courts</span></h3>
<p>There are three types of general trial courts in Rockland County: the New York Supreme Court, the County Court and the Justice Courts.  The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the New York State Unified Court System, which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State).  The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal.  Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000.  While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts.  In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>The County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear all criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases.  The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations.  The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Each of the towns and fifteen of the villages have Justice Courts. These courts mostly hear routine traffic ticket cases, especially from the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Interstate Parkway. They also handle drunk driving charges, lower-level criminal misdemeanor matters, and they will occasionally perform arraignment on felonies (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court).  These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases, which, considering the population density and highways in the county, is not surprising.

<p>Like most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times–Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory of 1964,  Franklin Delano Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1936 (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and Woodrow Wilson's first campaign in 1912. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican once, in 2004 for George W. Bush; however, Bush only won that contest by less than 1,000 votes. Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring Westchester County, which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pollution">Pollution</span></h2>
<p>According to Scorecard.org, which integrates data from different sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2002, Rockland County ranked among the worst 10% in the United States in terms of air releases. Recent EPA statistics show that a total of 66 facilities active today in Rockland County are currently regulated. In Scorecard's list of Top 10 polluters from 2002, the Lovett generating station, located in Tompkins Cove, is the top polluter, releasing 1,523,339 pounds of toxic emissions into the air. Two studies, one in 2000 and the other in 2004, were issued by the Clean Air Task Force to study the impacts of power plant emissions in the United States. Data specific for Rockland county shows that a total of $2,150,800 was paid in compensation for numerous illnesses caused by power plant pollution, including asthma attacks, heart attacks and death. Prior to 2014 the Lovett generating station was closed and dismantled.  It no longer exists.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Solar_field">Solar field</span></h2>
<p>Clarkstown is building a first-of-its-kind in New York State, a 2.3-megawatt solar system consisting of about 4,300 panels on top of a closed, highly regulated, flat shadeless 13-acre section of the former garbage landfill in West Nyack which will generate 3 million kilowatt-hours – enough power to supply about 200 homes, that will cover about one-third of the electric needs of the Town of Clarkstown government. The Clarkstown solar field project is at the maximum size that is currently allowed by New York State. Of the 1,200 installations in Orange and Rockland system, 450, or 32 percent, are in Rockland County and will save taxpayers as much as $4 million over 30 years by reducing the amount of the town’s annual electric bill – which is about $2 million and produce 10 percent of all the electricity that O&amp;R gets through solar power. This project was scheduled to be on line by the fall of 2014.

<p>Paul W. Adler, the chairperson of the Rockland County's Jewish Community Relations Council, said in a 1997 <i>New York Times</i> article that "There are two reasons villages get formed in Rockland.  One is to keep the Hasidim out and the other is to keep the Hasidim in."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>There are five towns in Rockland County. The most populous is Ramapo, with 126,595 people, while the least populous is Stony Point, with 15,059 people, according to the 2010 US Census.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>In 2015, ValuePenguin ranked the Towns of Clarkstown(119), Haverstraw(102), Orangetown(72), Ramapo(55) and Stony Point(52) as the Safest Places in New York with population of over 5,000 and other criteria. The villages of Spring Valley (169) and Suffern (42) also made the list. Ramapo ranked 7th place among big cities - population of over 20 thousand.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>There are nineteen incorporated villages in Rockland County, twelve of which are located at least partially in the town of Ramapo, and none of which are in Stony Point.
