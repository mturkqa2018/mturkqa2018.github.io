<p>Since 2006, Quebec has a green plan in order to achieve the objective of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. The <i>MinistÃ¨re du DÃ©veloppement durable, de l'Environnement et des Parcs du QuÃ©bec</i> (Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks) is primarily responsible for implementing environmental policy. For its part, the SociÃ©tÃ© des Ã©tablissements de plein air du QuÃ©bec (SEPAQ) is the lead agency for the management of national parks and wildlife reserves. Quebec currently protects nearly 8.12% (135,326Â km) of its territory. The first protected area was the creation of Mt. Royal Park in 1876 followed by the Mont-Tremblant National Park in 1894.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The Quebec government has been working to introduce the electric car since 1994, including contributing financing for technologies such as the TM4 MÐ¤TIVE, an electric motor designed and manufactured in Quebec. Hydro-QuÃ©bec has recently tested more than 50 i-MiEV in order to gradually introduce the charging stations across the province. This is the largest pilot test of electric cars in Canada. Quebec was the first province in Canada to allow the ZENN car to drive on the roads. During the inaugural speech of 2011, Jean Charest announced five priorities for the next 30 years including the Plan Nord and called for a revolution in electric cars.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest announced targets for reducing greenhouse gases during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% by the year 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec GHGs. This new law stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an emission ceiling of 187Â grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7Â L/100Â km. This level must be reduced annually up to 127Â grams of GHG/km or approximatively 5.3Â L/100Â km in 2016. These standards are as stringent as those in California (United States), according to the Government of Quebec. The provincial government plans to offer up to $8,000 rebate towards the purchase of an electric car. The government hopes that by 2020, a quarter of cars purchased in Quebec will be electric. The plan would position Quebec as a world leader in electrified transportation according to Jean Charest.

<p>Quebec became the first region in North America to set a carbon tax. Since 2007, consumers pay a special tax on gasoline. Since July 2011, Quebec has imposed a carbon tax that affect more than 85% of industries in the province. This tax will be mandatory from 2013. The sectors affected by this carbon tax will have to reduce their carbon dioxide below 25 000 kilotonnes per year. Only the forest industry, agriculture and waste industries are not affected by this tax. In addition, the Quebec government plans to recover 60% of putrescible organic matter by 2015 in order to reduce its emissions. Quebec climate policy has been harshly criticised by the federal government under Prime minister Stephen Harper. In 2010, former minister Jim Prentice has openly criticized Quebec's plan to set GHG standards for motor vehicles sold in the province, describing it as "lunatic". However, ten months later, Prentice successor, John Baird, has praised Quebec as a world leader in GHG abatement.
