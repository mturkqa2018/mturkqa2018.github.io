<p>The names "Loyola" and "Marymount" have long been associated with Catholic higher education in countries around the globe. Saint Ignatius Loyola, founder of The Society of Jesus, sanctioned the foundation of his order's first school in 1548.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary have conducted educational institutions since their establishment in France in 1849 by Father Jean Gailhac. These two traditions of education have come together in Los Angeles as Loyola Marymount University.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span id="St._Vincent.27s_College"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="St._Vincent's_College">St. Vincent's College</span></h3>
<p>The present university is the direct heir to the pioneer Catholic college and first institution of higher learning in Southern California, St. Vincent's College, founded and run by the Vincentians until 1911.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>1. In 1865, the Vincentian Fathers were commissioned by Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi to found St. Vincent's College for boys in Los Angeles. Father John Asmuth, C.M., served as the first President Rector. Classes were held for two years in the Lugo Adobe on the east side of the Plaza while a new building was being finished. The historic home,  aptly donated by Don Vicente Lugo, was one of few two-story adobes then in town.  The house stood in the empty lot across Alameda Street between the Plaza and Union Station, (near Olvera Street).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>2. After two years, the college and school moved into a new, brick building several blocks south by the lower plaza, Pershing Square.  
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>3. Later, the brick building was replaced with a larger one in stone that became a familiar landmark for its stately, central tower topped by a mansard roof. The property took up the block bounded by Fort (Broadway), 6th, Hill, and 7th streets. When St. Vincent's later moved to a new campus, the old building became US Army Headquarters. Today, the site is in the heart of Los Angeles's Jewelry District, encompassing St. Vincent Court. In 1869, St. Vincent's was accredited by the state.

St. Vincent's College, facing east over Grand Ave. near LATTC, 1905.</div></div></div>
<p>4. In 1887, the college moved to a new, more majestic campus—bounded by Grand Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Hope Street, and 18th—which would have a chapel, residence hall, cottages, and a traditional, brick-and-ivy complex housing classrooms and lecture halls. Like the second college building by Pershing Square, the new retained a tall, central tower topped with St. Vincent's trademark mansard roof.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>While the campus underwent many expansions, the athletic program grew, and the Catholic Collegiates competed against Occidental's Presbyterians and USC's Methodists.  St. Vincent's athletes were also recruited into professional sports.  During this era, from St. Vincent's College graduated many alumni who would become famous in the history of Los Angeles, among whom were Isidore Dockweiler, Eugene Biscailuz and Leo Carrillo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 1911, the Vincentians, who had led the college since its founding the century before, were replaced with the Jesuits, who quickly moved the college to a larger property.  As planning began on developing a 20th-century university, enrollment was folded into a new college, briefly called "Los Angeles College" that would soon evolve into Loyola.  The old campus became St. Vincent's School.  In 1922, St. Vincent's historic campus was sold.  Over time, the historic buildings of old St. Vincent's College have been torn down and replaced.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beginnings_of_Loyola_in_L.A.">Beginnings of Loyola in L.A.</span></h3>
<p>When the Vincentians pulled out of educational ministry in Los Angeles in 1911, Bishop Thomas Conaty asked the Jesuits to come to Los Angeles and take over St. Vincent's College. Not wishing to assume any of the college's debt, the Jesuits, instead, founded Los Angeles College in 1911. They simultaneously opened their high school division (Loyola High School) and folded the board, faculty, and students of St. Vincent's College into Los Angeles College at a new location made up of several bungalows at Avenue 52, Highland Park, Los Angeles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Father Richard A. Gleeson, S.J. served as the first Jesuit President but the board of the college was initially composed of Vincentian Fathers. Rapid growth prompted the Jesuits to seek a new campus on Venice Boulevard in 1917; with this move, the name of the school was changed back to St. Vincent's College. However, in 1918 the name was once again changed to Loyola College of Los Angeles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Graduate instruction began in 1920 with the foundation of a separate law school. Though instruction at the undergraduate level remained exclusive to male students, women were admitted to the law school. The law school was the second in Los Angeles to admit Jewish students. (USC's law school had done so at least since 1910.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>In 1928, the undergraduate division of Loyola relocated, under then-President Joseph A. Sullivan, S.J., to the present Westchester campus, and achieved university status in 1930, becoming Loyola University of Los Angeles. Loyola Law School did not move with the rest of the university, but moved later to another location just west of downtown Los Angeles.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>World War II had a significant impact on Loyola University. As enrollment began to plummet, Father Edward Whelan, S.J., president at the time, brokered a deal with the US Army to form an officer training program for both Army and Navy officers. The contract allowed the university to remain open during the war and enrollment hit all-time highs as a result of returning veterans taking advantage of the G.I. Bill in the mid-to-late 1940s. Additionally, Father Whelan recognized the grave injustice of the Japanese internment camps during World War II. At Loyolay, he hired and housed many Japanese Americans returning to Los Angeles after their release from the camps. 
In 1949, Father Charles Cassassa, S.J., Ph.D., was named president and began one of the most consequential presidencies in the university's history. His work included the formation of a graduate division on the Westchester campus in June 1950, graduate work having formed an integral part of the Teacher Education Program during the preceding two years, expanding campus infrastructure. He then established the Institute of Human Relations to promote improved racial relations in business and in government. Future Mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley attended the first year-long program held by the Institute of Human Relations and remained lifelong friends with Father Cassassa.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Father Cassassa also continued Father Whelan's legacy of combating racial injustice. In 1950, he forced the school's football team to forfeit an away game against Texas Western since the school's rules prevented African-American players, such as Loyola's Bill English, to play on their field. During the Cassassa era, the law school moved to its current campus, designed by Frank Gehry, in 1964. Loyola University also continued as an all-male school until its merger with Marymount College in 1973. There were, however, several notable exceptions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The first exception occurred during the summer months, when the Loyola faculty offered classes for religious women (Catholic nuns) seeking undergraduate degrees. Many sisters from across Los Angeles and Orange County acquired their undergraduate degrees from Loyola. Additionally, women were admitted to several of Loyola's graduate programs prior to the affiliation and merger with Marymount College. Furthermore, there were several female students admitted to Marymount College who later matriculated into Loyola University during the two schools' five-year affiliation prior to 1973, primarily into Engineering and Business majors which Marymount did not offer.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beginnings_of_Marymount_in_L.A.">Beginnings of Marymount in L.A.</span></h3>
<p>In separate though parallel developments, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary began teaching local young women in 1923. Having been invited by Bishop John Cantwell, seven sisters of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, under the leadership of Mother Cecilia Rafter, R.S.H.M., formed what was first an elementary school and, shortly thereafter, a high school. Within ten years, so many young women wished to continue their education with the Marymount sisters beyond high school that Marymount Junior College opened as an all-women's school on the Westwood campus of Marymount High School in 1933.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Mother Gertrude Cain, R.S.H.M., served as the first president of the junior college and guided its development into a four-year college in 1948, assuming the name Marymount College of Los Angeles. In 1960, having outgrown its shared Westwood campus, Marymount College moved both its two-year program and its four-year program to the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwestern Los Angeles. The Palos Verdes campus became Marymount California University.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In 1967 Sister Raymunde McKay, R.S.H.M., D.Phil., the president of Marymount College, extended an invitation to Sister Mary Felix Montgomery, C.S.J., Ph.D., General Superior of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange, to merge Marymount College with St. Joseph College of Orange, a four-year liberal arts college for women religious run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange, which Sister Montgomery accepted. St. Joseph College was originally formed as St. Joseph Teacher's College, a junior college affiliated with The Catholic University of America in 1953. In 1959 it was incorporated as an autonomous, four-year institution and assumed the St. Joseph College name.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In 1968 Marymount and St. Joseph's Colleges merged under the Marymount name with an agreement that the traditions and heritage of both the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange would be carried in the Marymount name. As part of the Marymount College Agreement, Marymount College was administered "co-equally" by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange as members of both communities partnered in the governing, staffing, and teaching of Marymount College.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Subsequently, St. Joseph College of Orange was renamed Marymount College of Orange. During the academic year, it remained a college for women religious seeking their baccalaureate degrees; college courses were offered to men and women during the summers at the Orange campus. The same year, Marymount College began its affiliation with Loyola University, moving its four-year program at the Palos Verdes campus to the Westchester campus of Loyola University. Marymount College then operated on three campuses: Palos Verdes retained its two-year program, Orange remained a campus for women religious in Orange County, and Westchester was a campus for both lay and religious women.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Affiliation_and_merger_of_Loyola_and_Marymount">Affiliation and merger of Loyola and Marymount</span></h3>
<p>By the mid-1960s, Loyola University of Los Angeles had unsuccessfully petitioned the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal James Francis McIntyre, to allow coeducation at Loyola for several years. In 1967, however, Sister McKay, President of Marymount College, received permission from Cardinal McIntyre to begin affiliation with Loyola University on Loyola's Westchester campus. Sister McKay and Father Charles Cassassa, S.J., Ph.D., President of Loyola University, held a joint press conference to announce the affiliation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>The affiliation of Marymount College and Loyola University began in 1968 when Marymount's four-year program moved to Loyola's Westchester campus; this arrangement (two independent schools on one campus) continued for five years. In 1970, the Student Governments of Loyola University (ASLU—Associated Students of Loyola University) and Marymount College (ASMC—Associated Students of Marymount College) joined to form the Associated Students of Loyola and Marymount (ASLM).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>After five years of sharing faculties and facilities, Loyola University and Marymount College merged and assumed the name Loyola Marymount University in 1973. Through this union, the expanded university maintained the century-old mission of Catholic higher education in Los Angeles and incorporated the educational traditions of the Jesuits, Marymount sisters, and Orange sisters into one institution. At this time, ASLM became known as the Associated Students of Loyola Marymount University (ASLMU).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Father Donald Merrifield, S.J., Ph.D., who became president of Loyola University in 1969, continued to serve as the university's president. The academic vice president of Marymount College, Sister Renee Harrangue, R.S.H.M., Ph.D., became the provost. During Father Merrifield's tenure as president thirteen new buildings were constructed on Loyola Marymount's main campus including the Von der Ahe Communication Arts Building, the George Page Baseball Stadium, Doolan Hall, Gersten Pavilion, Burns Fine Art Center, the Laband Art Gallery, the Leavey Faculty Center and the Loyola Apartments. Father Merrifield oversaw the expansion of Loyola Law School's campus in Pico-Union, near downtown Los Angeles. Merrifield and the university commissioned architect Frank Gehry to design the new campus, which was needed to accommodate increased enrollment.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Merrifield also implemented a number of programs to increase minority enrollment, such as financial aid packages and scholarships, and added African American and Latino studies programs. He stepped down as president of Loyola Marymount in 1984, but remained the university's chancellor until 2002.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Marymount College's four-year program subsequently separated from its two-year program. The Marymount two-year program remained incorporated as a separate institution and received accreditation in 1971 as the independently run Marymount College, Palos Verdes, which is currently operates in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. In 2010, Marymount College, Palos Verdes received accreditation as a four-year institution.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>With the merger of Loyola University and Marymount College in 1973, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange joined the Society of Jesus and the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary as one of the sponsoring religious communities of Loyola Marymount University. Marymount College of Orange was renamed the Orange Campus of Loyola Marymount University. The Orange Campus offered continuing education and summer courses to men and women through the 1980s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_history">Recent history</span></h3>
<p>In 2007, the university reestablished its presence in Orange County, California when the Theological Studies Department began offering a two-year master's program in Pastoral Theology in Orange, California. The first cohort graduated in the Spring of 2009 and the second cohort began the following the fall. The classes are held in the Marywood offices of the Diocese of Orange, not far from the now defunct Orange Campus of Loyola Marymount University.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>In articulating a vision for this collegiate enterprise, the Board of Trustees turned to the history of the four-century-old Jesuit educational philosophy, as well as to the educational philosophies and traditions of the Sisters of Marymount and St. Joseph.

<p>On March 1, 2010, Loyola Marymount President, Father Robert B. Lawton, S.J., announced his retirement as head of the university, effective at the end of the academic year in May 2010. Lawton cited health problems, including a slow recovery from a 2009 back surgery, as the main reason for his departure. He had served as president for eleven years, beginning his tenure in 1999.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>David W. Burcham, a 1984 graduate of Loyola Law School became the first lay president in the school's history. Burcham held the office for five years, from 2010-2015. Burcham, who presided over LMU's centennial in 2011, opted not to stay on after his term ended. The LMU board of trustees elected Timothy Law Snyder, Ph.D., as the 16th president and he took office on June 1, 2015.

<p>LMU sits atop the Del Rey Hills bluffs 150 acres (61 ha) in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles. The original 99 acres (40 ha) were donated to the university by Harry Culver. Xavier Hall, named for St. Francis Xavier, S.J., a companion of St. Ignatius of Loyola, S.J., and St. Robert's Hall, named for St. Robert Bellarmine, S.J., a cardinal and Doctor of the Church, were the first two buildings to be built on the current Westchester Campus. Following their completion in 1929, Xavier Hall housed both the Jesuit Faculty and the students at the time while St. Robert's Hall served as the academic and administrative building.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>Sacred Heart Chapel and the Regents Bell Tower were the next non-residential structures to be built on the campus (1953–55). The Malone Student Center, named for Lorenzo M. Malone, S.J., an alumnus of the university and former Dean of Students and Treasurer of the University, was completed in 1958 and renovated in 1996. LMU now houses 36 academic, athletic, administrative, and event facilities as well as twelve on-campus residence halls (dormitory and suite models) and six on-campus apartment complexes. The campus houses four large open grass areas not reserved exclusively for athletic play. Alumni Mall and Sunken Gardens provide scenery to the campus that is already laden with views of the entire Los Angeles Basin, Marina del Rey, Playa Vista, Playa del Rey, and the Pacific Ocean.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>The university's acquisition of University Hall in 2000 brought the campus a new entrance as well as much-needed office and classroom space. University Hall is a facility unique to any academic institution: It was originally constructed for Hughes Aircraft as their world headquarters and converted from an exclusively corporate facility to a building thriving with academic life.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>LMU acquired the 1,000,000-square-foot (93,000 m) building in January 2000 from Raytheon, which bought Hughes Aircraft. LMU completed the interior remodel of approximately 250,000 square feet (23,000 m) in April 2001. The building, which houses the university's Bellarmine College of Liberal Arts, is constructed of steel and concrete and is divided into seven structures above ground. University Hall has over 500,000 square feet (46,000 m) of floor space and contains over 1,000 parking spaces in three underground levels. The 70,000 square feet (6,500 m) of atrium space is and will continue to be the venue for many LMU events. University Hall was featured in season one, episode two of the television series <i>Bones</i>, as the fictional "Hamilton Cultural Center" in Washington, D.C.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p><i>The Princeton Review</i> has recently ranked LMU as having the 7th-most beautiful campus in America. CampusSqueeze college e-zine ranked LMU as having the 3rd-most beautiful campus in America.

<p>The governing body of the university is the school's independent board of trustees, headed by a chairman. The university's executive officer is the president. Prior to 2009, a prerequisite to serve as the university's president was membership in the Society of Jesus; however, the board of trustees voted to allow educators not a part of the Jesuit Order to become president. These changes were made at the recommendation of the American Assistancy of Jesuits, the collective body of Jesuits in the United States in response to the declining number of Jesuits as well as those prepared to serve as the president of a major university. See a list of past presidents.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></p><p>The president is assisted by the chancellor, assistant to the president, director internal audit, the vice president for mission and ministry (under whose direction the Office of Campus Ministry and the Center for Ignatian Spirituality operates) and the vice president for intercultural affairs.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sponsoring_religious_orders">Sponsoring religious orders</span></h2>
<p>LMU is sponsored primarily by three religious orders that have long been associated with education, the Society of Jesus, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange. However, other religious orders such as the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Carmelites) and the Sisters of Saint Louis have members employed on campus.

<p>The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary also house several religious sisters adjacent campus. From 1968 until 1999 the sisters lived on campus in the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center. In 1999, they donated the building to the university and moved into residential houses off campus. The Western American provincial center, which had been in the Leavey center, was moved to Montebello. The Marymount Sisters sponsor the Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts which attempts to preserve the transformative educational tradition of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and promotes a dialogue between faith and culture as expressed in fine, performing, literary and communication arts.

<p>Loyola Marymount's Office of Campus Ministry is a component to the promotion of the university's mission and identity. Founded in 1911 as the University Chaplain, this division became known as Campus Ministry in 1973 with a stipulation that the Director would be a Jesuit. By 1986 this requirement was waived when Sr. Margaret Mary Dolan, R.S.H.M. became the director. Dolan, an alumna of Marymount College's class of 1958, received her Master's from LMU in 1974 and also served the university as a campus minister, director of alumni relations, residence hall minister, and alumni chaplain since 1973.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">84</span></p><p>In 2008, as part of the university's Centennial Capital Campaign, it was announced that an $8 million fundraising goal was set to endow the office as the "Peg Dolan, RSHM Campus Ministry Center" in honor of Dolan's contributions to the university. The same year, the university asked her to address the class of 2008 at the undergraduate commencement exercises and she was awarded an honorary doctorate. At the dedication ceremony in September 2008, over 700 alumni returned to campus to honor her legacy at the university. When Dolan died in 2009, more than 1,000 people returned to campus for two days of liturgies celebrating her life.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">85</span></p><p>Located at the north end of the university, Sacred Heart Chapel is the main worship space on campus. A basilica-style church, Sacred Heart has two side altars and the Mary chapel, which is located behind the crucifix, in addition to the main chapel space. The chapel is lined by tall stained glass windows. Each window bears the seal of one of the 28 other Jesuit universities in the United States; additionally, following the 1973 merger, edged glass window of the other four Marymount colleges and universities in the United States were added.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Loyola Marymount Lions</div>
<p>Athletic teams at Loyola Marymount are known as Lions; the school's primary athletic affiliation is with the West Coast Conference. While LMU has had success in several sports, it is probably best remembered for its men's basketball teams between 1985 and 1990, with Paul Westhead as coach and for the death of star player Hank Gathers (#44), who collapsed during the second round of the WCC tournament on March 4, 1990, and for his friendship with teammate Bo Kimble (#30). Their jerseys have been retired at LMU.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">91</span></p><p>Especially well-remembered was the 1990 team, led by Gathers and Kimble until tragedy struck in the WCC tournament. Gathers collapsed during a game and died due to a previously diagnosed heart condition. Playing for their fallen teammate, the Lions advanced to the Elite Eight (regional final) of the NCAA tournament before falling to eventual champions UNLV.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">92</span></p><p>The primary indoor athletic facility is the Gersten Pavilion.
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim starting pitcher C. J. Wilson attended and pitched at Loyola Marymount in 2001. LMU Softball holds many records. It owns more titles than any other PCSC (Pacific Coast Softball Conference) team, with three in 2003, 2005, and 2007. In 2007, Tiffany Pagano and LMU beat UCLA 4-2 in the Los Angeles regional in the NCAA Tournament, to mark their first win over the Bruins, and the first time that UCLA had not won a regional and advanced to the Women's College World Series.
