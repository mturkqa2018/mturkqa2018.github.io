<p><i><b>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest</b></i> (original title in Swedish: <i lang="sv">Luftslottet som sprÃ¤ngdes</i>, literally, <i>the air castle that blew up</i>) is the third novel in the best-selling <i>Millennium</i> series by Swedish writer Stieg Larsson. It was published in Swedish in 2007; in English, in the UK, in October 2009; and in the US and Canada on 25 May 2010. The first three novels in the series, <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i> (2005), <i>The Girl Who Played with Fire</i> (2006), and <i>The Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest</i> were written by Stieg Larsson before being shown to a publisher and were published posthumously after his fatal heart attack in 2004. Additionally, all three novels were adapted as films.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>The book begins as Lisbeth Salander is flown to Sahlgrenska Hospital. It picks up where <i>The Girl Who Played with Fire</i> left off.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_the_hospital">In the hospital</span></h3>
<p>After surgery, Salander is moved to an intensive care ward under guard, accessible only to police, doctors, nurses, and her lawyer, Annika Giannini (who is also Mikael Blomkvist's sister). Zalachenko, whom Salander injured with an axe, is two rooms away. Niedermann, thanks to botched responses from the local law enforcement, is on the run after murdering a police officer, and carjacking and kidnapping a woman during his escape. Niedermann seeks help from his old friends at the outlaw SvavelsjÃ¶ Motorcycle Club, kills the treasurer, and steals 800,000 kronor before disappearing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>These events prompt immediate action from "the Section", a secret division of Swedish Security Service (SÃ¤po) created for purposes of counterintelligence, and responsible for Zalachenko's asylum and supervision. Evert Gullberg, founder and former chief of the Section, asks former Section associate Fredrik Clinton to become acting head of the Section and plots to deflect attention away from the Section by silencing Salander, Blomkvist, and Zalachenko.  They form a working alliance with the unsuspecting prosecutor of Salander's case, Richard EkstrÃ¶m. Dr. Peter Teleborian, the psychiatrist who supervised Salander when she was previously institutionalised on the Section's orders, provides EkstrÃ¶m with a false psychiatric examination and recommends that she be reinstitutionalised, preferably without a trial.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Gullberg, who has terminal cancer, murders Zalachenko in his hospital bed and attempts to enter Salander's room to murder her, but is prevented by Giannini. Gullberg then commits suicide in the passage outside Salander's room. A distraught Giannini informs Blomkvist of the shootings. Section operatives murder Gunnar BjÃ¶rk, the junior SÃ¤po officer who had handled Zalachenko after the latter's defection and who was Blomkvist's source of information about the Section; the operatives falsify the death as a suicide. Other Section operatives burgle Blomkvist's apartment and mug Annika Giannini, specifically making off with copies of the classified SÃ¤po file that contains Zalachenko's identity, and plant bugs in the homes and phones of <i>Millennium</i> staff.  The timing of the attacks and the property that was taken cause Blomkvist to realise that the phones are tapped, and he begins to investigate the Section in earnest for a <i>Millennium</i> exposÃ©.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Counterattack">Counterattack</span></h3>
<p>Blomkvist hires Dragan Armansky's Milton Security to handle countersurveillance. Armansky, on his own initiative, informs SÃ¤po Constitutional Protection Director Torsten Edklinth about the constitutional violations. Edklinth, along with his assistant Monica Figuerola, begins a clandestine investigation into the Section. After Figuerola confirms the allegations, Edklinth contacts the Justice Minister and the Prime Minister who approve a full investigation by Constitutional Protection, and later invite Blomkvist to a confidential meeting in which they are to share information. They agree to Blomkvist's deadlineâhe intends to publish his findings about the state's manipulation of Salander's constitutional rights on 15 July, the third day of her trial, and the government agree to arrest any identified ringleaders of the Section at the same time.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Blomkvist convinces Salander's doctor, Dr. Anders Jonasson, to return her Palm Tungsten handheld computer to her. Blomkvist arranges to have a cellular phone placed in a duct near Salander's room, granting her Internet access through the resulting hotspot, which she uses to maintain contact with the outside world and work on a statement for her upcoming trial.  Jonasson also helps her fake complications from her surgery, so that she can remain in the hospital's custody (and out of the police's).  Meanwhile, Blomkvist, Armansky, Bublanski, Edklinth and their allies continue their joint counter-surveillance of the "Zalachenko club," feeding them misinformation about <i>Millennium</i>'s (supposed) passivity regarding Salander's trial.  They identify nine central players in the Section.  Additionally, Blomkvist and Figuerola become romantically involved.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Berger_subplot">Berger subplot</span></h3>
<p>Whilst all of the above is going on, Erika Berger leaves <i>Millennium</i> to be editor-in-chief at Sweden's largest daily paper, the (fictional) <i>Svenska Morgon-Posten</i> (<i>S.M.P.</i>). Though the board hired her to revitalise the paper's sagging circulation numbers, they shut down her every proposal, emphasising profits over sustainability.  Meanwhile, Henry Cortez, junior <i>Millennium</i> reporter, uncovers a story about a Swedish toilet-manufacturing company that engages child labour in Vietnam. His research reveals that the boss of said firm is Magnus BorgsjÃ¶, who is CEO and major shareholder at <i>S.M.P.</i> and hired Berger for her new position. Blomkvist gives a copy of the story to Berger, agreeing to delay its publication until August while she confronts BorgsjÃ¶ and convinces him to resign gracefully.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Berger begins receiving graphic e-mails and threats from an anonymous source within <i>S.M.P.</i>, most of them calling her a "whore." Erika asks her staff to remain on alert, but matters escalate when the stalker breaks into Berger's home and steals private materials, such as high school love letters, a sex tape made with her husband Greger Beckman, and her copy of Cortez's story. Berger engages Milton Security to help secure her home, and Armansky sends over former police officer Susanne Linder to provide protection while Beckman is abroad on business.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Salander, whilst engaged in her own homework, discovers Berger's plight and mobilises the "Hacker Republic," an elite and international group of computer wizards, to assist.  They determine that Peter Fredriksson, <i>S.M.P.</i> employee and former high school classmate of Berger, is the culprit.  Linder steps outside the law to confront Fredriksson and recovers Berger's things. However, Fredriksson has already passed <i>Millennium</i>'s exposÃ© on to BorgsjÃ¶. BorgsjÃ¶ orders Berger to suppress the story at <i>Millennium</i> or lose her job at <i>S.M.P.</i> Berger, her sense of journalistic integrity offended, instead runs the story in that day's issue of <i>S.M.P.</i> under Cortez's byline, and then resigns in protest over both this and her treatment by upper management. BorgsjÃ¶ and Fredriksson are both forced out, whilst Berger is accepted back at <i>Millennium</i> with open arms.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trial">Trial</span></h3>
<p>As Salander's trial approaches, the Section abruptly realise that Blomkvist's and <i>Millennium</i>'s seeming lack of preparation are simply a cover story for their (successful, if now detected) campaign of misinformation. Clinton, having no idea what Blomkvist knows or plans to publish, arranges to plant cocaine in Blomkvist's apartment and simultaneously hire two members of the Yugoslav mafia to murder him; their intention is to frame him as a drug dealer and thus destroy his credibility. The former is easily undermined by the security cameras installed by Milton Security, which capture the plant; the latter requires the intervention of Figuerola, Andersson, Modig and several others from both SÃ¤po and Milton. Blomkvist and Berger are spirited off to a Milton safehouse, allowing SÃ¤po to further the misdirection by claiming that the two hitmen simply had the bad luck to stop for a meal at the same restaurant as the police officers. Berger, meanwhile, intuits Figuerola's and Blomkvist's affair, and promises Figuerola to stay clear of Blomkvist as long as they are together.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The first two days of Salander's trial, on various counts of aggravated violence, proceed with relative calm. However, on the third day, <i>Millennium</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s dual book-and-magazine exposÃ© is published, the officers of the Section are arrested, Channel TV4 runs an hour-long program on the Section using (pre-recorded) interviews and material from Blomkvist, and Giannini systematically destroys Teleborian's testimony, proving that the Section and Teleborian had conspired to commit Salander at age 12 to protect Zalachenko, that Salander's rights had been repeatedly violated, and that they were once again conspiring against her. Blomkvist and Edklinth provide evidence proving that Teleborian's recent "psychiatric assessment" of Salander was fabricated and that he is working with the Section to silence her. Teleborian is then arrested for possession of child pornography, which was found on his computer by Salander and her hacker friends, Plague and Trinity. EkstrÃ¶m, realising that the law is (or should be) on Salander's side, withdraws all charges against her, and her declaration of incompetence is rescinded.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aftermath">Aftermath</span></h3>
<p>With the evidence and credibility of the prosecution shattered, the prosecutor drops all charges against Salander. Freed, Salander embarks on an overseas trip to forget the events. She spends several months at Gibraltar, among other things to pay a visit to the man managing the billions she had stolen from Hans-Erik WennerstrÃ¶m in <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>. She also tracks down Miriam Wu, who is studying at a university in Paris, and apologises for putting her life in danger during the events of <i>Played With Fire</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Salander soon discovers that being a "legally responsible citizen" involves its share of toil and drudgery.  As Zalachenko's daughter, Salander is obliged to inherit half of his properties and wealth, while the other half goes to her twin sister Camilla, whom no one has heard from in more than a decade. Suspicious about an abandoned factory in her father's estate, she goes there to investigate.  There, she discovers two dead women, and Niedermann, who had been hiding there from the police. After a brief struggle and chase, Salander outwits Niedermann by nailing his feet to the plank floor with a nail gun. She is tempted to kill him herself, but instead reports his location to Sonny Nieminen, acting head of the SvavelsjÃ¶ biker gang, and then reports the entire brawl to the police.  She leaves before the stand-off concludes, satisfied that both Niedermann and the SvavelsjÃ¶ bikers have been brought to justice.  (She later learns that Niedermann was killed by the bikers, and Nieminen by the police while resisting arrest.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Back at her apartment in Stockholm, Salander receives a visit from Blomkvist. The story ends with the two reconciling.

<h2><span id="Characters_from_Larsson.27s_life"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Characters_from_Larsson's_life">Characters from Larsson's life</span></h2>
<ul><li>Svante Branden helps Salander "by denouncing the fraudulent analysis of Dr. Peter Teleborian and the arbitrary internment to which he had subjected her." Larsson and his life partner Eva Gabrielsson were loaned a student room by the real Svante Branden who, after being neighbors with Larsson in UmeÃ¥, was a psychiatrist and a friend. In her book <i>"There Are Things I Want You to Know" About Stieg Larsson and Me</i>, Gabrielsson writes that the character and the person were a lot alike because Svante "was against every form of violation of human rights and freedom. When Stieg made him one of the heroes of <i>The Millennium Trilogy</i>, it was a way of paying homage to him." </li>
<li>Anders Jonasson, the doctor who helps Salander significantly throughout her hospital stay, is based on Anders Jakobsson, a longtime friend of Stieg Larsson and Eva Gabrielsson's. His name was changed in the novel to Jonasson after he ran into Erland, Larsson's father, in a supermarket and told him how he felt about Gabrielsson's being denied access to Larsson's estate after his death.</li>
<li>Kurdo Baksi, Kurdish-Swedish publisher of <i>Black and White</i> magazine and collaborator with Stieg Larsson at the Expo Foundation, appears "as himself" in the books, along with his publishing house.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<p><i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</i> was listed at the top of Amazon.com's bestseller list before arriving in bookstores, extremely unusual for an English-language book in translation. Just as unusually, this book was not made available in paperback until 21 February 2012, or more than two years after its original English-language publication in October 2009, probably because it still regularly appeared in Top 10 best seller lists as a hardcover book (e.g., rated #5 in the <i>New York Times</i> best seller list for the week ending 29 January 2012).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The <i>Millennium</i> series is described in a <i>The New York Times</i> review as "utterly addicting", and this, the third in the series, received a good review. Salander is described as "one of the most original characters in a thriller to come along in a while". The combination of her resourcefulness, intelligence and apparent fragility underlies her ability to win the battle to have her re-institutionalised. The compelling character of Salander and her past, completely explained in the volume of the trilogy, is a counterpoint to Blomkvist's more mundane character, writes the reviewer. The novel itself is compared to John LeCarre's cold-war thrillers. Writing for <i>The Guardian</i>, Kate Mosse declares that <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</i> is a "grown-up work for grown-up readers", which she says shows a well-presented plausible narrative. <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> disagrees, describing the plots as "improbable", but notes the popularity of the series, referring to it as "an authentic phenomenon". Writing for <i>The Washington Post,</i> Patrick Anderson claims the third in the series "brings the saga to a satisfactory conclusion".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>The overly long and complicated plot is criticised by Marcel Berlins writing for <i>The Sunday Times</i>. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> critic agrees, pointing at the implausibility of Larsson's plot, the weak writing and characterisations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Publication_history">Publication history</span></h2>
<p>Larsson submitted the book to two Swedish publishers, with Norstedts FÃ¶rlag accepting the manuscript for publication. Norstedts commissioned Steve Murray under the pen-name of Reg Keeland to undertake the English translation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Alfred A. Knopf bought the rights to the book, along with the preceding two volumes in the series, after Larsson's death in 2004. <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest</i> was published with a first print-run of 800,000 copies.
