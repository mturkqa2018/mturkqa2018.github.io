<p><b>WPHI-FM</b> (103.9 FM, "Boom 103.9") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to serve Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Urban One through licensee Radio One Licenses, LLC and broadcasts an urban contemporary format. Studios are located in Bala Cynwyd, and the broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at (<span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">40°02′30.1″N</span> <span class="longitude">75°14′10.1″W</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct">﻿ / ﻿</span><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">40.041694°N 75.236139°W</span><span style="display:none">﻿ / <span class="geo">40.041694; -75.236139</span></span></span></span>). The station has always been short-spaced due to adjacent channel interference from WMGM in Atlantic City, WXCY in Havre de Grace, Maryland, and WNNJ in Newton, New Jersey (all located on 103.7 FM), WAEB-FM in Allentown and WNNK in Harrisburg (both located on 104.1 FM), as well as WRFF (104.5 FM), and co-channel interference from WRCN on Long Island and WNBM in Bronxville, New York. As such, the station broadcasts at only 270 watts, making it the weakest station broadcasting from the Roxborough tower farm.

<p>103.9 originally started out on November 1, 1960 as <b>WIBF-FM</b>, which was owned by Fox Broadcasting, not related to the more recent Fox Broadcasting Company television network.  The call letters stood for the station's owners — brothers William and Irwin Fox and their father Benjamin Fox, a local real estate developer.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the station featured a format of MOR, big bands, Dixieland jazz and the area's first FM country music show, plus religious and ethnic programs.  By the mid-1970s, the station switched to religious and ethnic programming during the day and Spanish music at night. The Barry Reisman Show, featuring Jewish music and programming, was broadcast during the afternoon drive time from 1969 through the station's sale in 1992.  In 1965, the station picked up a television sister in WIBF-TV, channel 29 (now WTXF-TV, a station coincidentally owned by the Fox Broadcasting Company).

<p>The station sold by the Fox family in October 1992 by Jarad Broadcasting, and on November 9, 1992, at Midnight, WDRE from Garden City, New York started simulcasting its programming with WIBF-FM, and shortly after the simulcast began, WIBF's branding was changed to "103.9 WDRE" to match the New York station. The simulcasting was part of a large effort by Jarad called "The Underground Network", a network consisting of seven stations from across the country simulcasting WDRE. In 1995, the network ceased operations, WDRE in New York would change its call letters back to WLIR, and made WIBF-FM in Philadelphia an independent, local modern rock station; WIBF-FM then changed its own callsign to <b>WDRE</b> - "<b>W</b>e <b>D</b>a<b>RE</b> to be Different" - to match its branding.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>WDRE was branded as "Philly's Modern Rock". "Alive" by Pearl Jam was the first song played on WDRE.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The station helped launch the careers of many famous disc jockeys and local personalities.  They include Preston Elliot and Steve Morrison of the Preston and Steve morning show on WMMR, Bret Hamilton of WCAU-TV, Marilyn Russell (formerly of Y100, WXPN, WMGK, now on WOGL), Jim McGuinn (also known as Rumor Boy), the former Program Director of WPLY (now currently programming KCMP in the Twin Cities), and Mel "Toxic" Taylor, who went on to WYSP.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Veteran DJ Mel "Toxic" Taylor (formerly of WPST and WIFI) was the first DJ hired for the only 2 local shows that would be live from Philadelphia each week.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>When WDRE Philadelphia became a local radio station in 1995, talent was hired from within the city (e.g. Bret Hamilton, formerly of WIOQ) and outside of the city.  While WDRE never became a true mainstream radio station in the Philadelphia radio market due to its weak signal, the station gained a cult status in the Philadelphia area, and as a result, events like the station's music festival (known as "DREfest") sold out to a crowd of over 25,000 people.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>However, in December 1996, Radio One bought WDRE from Jarad, and on the 16th of that month, WDRE announced that the station would flip to a then-undisclosed format in February 1997.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Due to the informed notice of the station's flip, the staff at WDRE were able to organize a concert called "Bitterfest", which was to be held at The Electric Factory.  The concert featured local acts G Love and the Fun Lovin' Criminals, and was created to celebrate the life of WDRE as a local institution for modern rock.  On February 7, 1997, "Bitterfest" was held to a sold out crowd of over 3,000 people, with all of the WDRE staff present at the event.  At Midnight on February 8, 1997, as the crowd at Bitterfest chanted "'D-R-E! 'D-R-E! 'D-R-E!", a lucky (or unlucky) listener was selected to "pull the plug" on WDRE, with the station ending with the first song that started the format: Pearl Jam's "Alive". Two of the WDRE disc jockeys (Preston Eliot, Bret Hamilton) went to Y100, as did 'DRE Program Director Jim McGuinn, and midday and Sunday night DJ Marilyn Russell (as Promotions Director for Y100). Y100 was also bought out by Radio One in 2000, and flipped in 2005 to urban contemporary.

<p>On February 10, 1997, after a weekend of stunting with classic soul music, the station flipped to Urban Contemporary, branded as "Philly 103.9." The call letters were soon changed to <b>WPHI</b>. When the station rebranded as <b>The Beat</b> in April 2002, it shifted to rhythmic top 40. By 2006, Radio &amp; Records/Nielsen BDS moved it to the urban contemporary panel, but Mediabase followed suit in 2011, completing the rhythmic to urban shift.

<p>On February 27, 2005, Radio One moved the "Beat" format to the 100.3 frequency, which was formerly Y100. 103.9 then flipped to urban gospel, branded as "Praise 103.9". The callsign was changed to <b>WPPZ-FM</b> on March 3.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Except for "The Yolanda Adams Morning Show" and CeCe McGhee weekday afternoons, the station ran jockless throughout the day until August 2007. In late August, the addition of performer Lonnie Hunter from Chicago was made to be the mid-day personality along with Sheik Meah. Famous speaker Les Brown was also added to be on Sunday nights from 7–9pm. In September, Pastor Alan E. Waller joined the staff to do a Saturday morning show from 10–11am and two more weekend shows were added. The "Holy Hip-Hop Show" was added on Saturday nights from 7–9pm and a Christian dating show was added on Sundays from 9–11pm.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>WPPZ's current staff includes Lonnie Hunter, Brother Marcus, and CeCe Magee. Former DJs include Church Lady (2007–2008), Ed Long (2005–2007), CoCo Brother (2011–2013), and Les Brown and B.I.G. C.I.T.Y. (2008–2009; 2009–present).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>On September 27, 2016, at Midnight, WPPZ and WPHI swapped frequencies, with "Praise" moving to 107.9 FM, and "Boom" moving to 103.9 FM (it also marked the return of the WPHI call letters to the frequency that originated the call letters). With the change, WPHI's classic hip hop format shifted to urban contemporary; the classic hip hop songs have been reduced to just a few per hour, with the station now emphasizing currents and recurrents. This marks the fourth attempt by Radio One to compete against long dominant WUSL.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Eight months after WPHI's format switch, WISX flipped to a classic hip hop-leaning rhythmic AC on June 30, 2017.
