<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Broadbent was born on 24 May 1949 in Holton cum Beckering, in Lincolnshire, the second son of Doreen "Dee" Broadbent (nÃ©e Findlay), a sculptor, and Roy Laverick Broadbent, an artist, sculptor, interior designer and furniture maker. Broadbent's parents were both amateur actors who co-founded the Holton Players acting troupe at Holton. The two have been described by the BBC as conscientious objectors who "worked the land" rather than participate in World War II. In Wickenby, a former Methodist Chapel was purchased in 1970 by Holton Players, who converted it into a 100-seat theatre, named Broadbent Theatre in memory of Roy Broadbent, who designed the conversion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Broadbent had a twin sister who died at birth. Broadbent was educated at Leighton Park School, a Quaker school in Reading, and briefly attended art college before transferring to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He graduated in 1972. His early stage work included appearances as Patrick Barlow's assistant in the mock <i>National Theatre of Brent</i>.

<p>Broadbent's early stagework included a number of productions for The National Theatre of Brent as the downtrodden assistant Wallace to Patrick Barlow's self-important actor/manager character Desmond Olivier Dingle. Broadbent and Barlow played many male and female character roles in comically less-than-epic tellings of historical and religious stories, such as <i>The Complete Guide to Sex</i>, <i>The Greatest Story Ever Told</i>, <i>Revolution!!</i>, and <i>All The World's A Globe</i>. These were hits at the Edinburgh Fringe, in London, and on tour. Later stage work included the original productions of <i>Kafka's Dick</i> (1986) and <i>Our Country's Good</i> (1988) at the Royal Court Theatre and work for the Royal National Theatre including "The Government Inspector".

Based on a true story, the drama tells of the author Deric Longden's final years of marriage to his first wife Diana (Julie Walters) in the early 1980s and her fight against an illness which doctors then did not understand, later believed to be a form of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis. The film also featured Thora Hird as Deric Longden's mother Annie and Sian Thomas who played Aileen Armitage, the novelist who would become Longden's second wife in 1990.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>He proved his ability as a character actor in films including  <i>The Crying Game</i> (1992), <i>Enchanted April</i> (1992), <i>Bullets over Broadway</i> (1994), <i>The Borrowers</i> (1997), and <i>Little Voice</i> (1998) before taking a leading role in another Mike Leigh film, <i>Topsy-Turvy</i> (1999), playing dramatist Sir William S. Gilbert. He played "The Shy Doctor" in the 1999 Comic Relief parody <i>Doctor Who</i> sketch, <i>Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death</i>.

He had originally been offered the lead role of Del Boy in the series, but he turned it down due to other commitments. He has also played a role in the Inspector Morse series. Other comic roles include the lead role in the sitcom <i>The Peter Principle</i> and occasional guest appearances in <i>Not The Nine O'Clock News</i>, <i>Only Fools and Horses</i>, and <i>Victoria Wood As Seen on TV</i>.
