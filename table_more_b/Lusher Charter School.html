<p><b>Lusher Charter School</b> is a K-12 charter school in uptown New Orleans, Louisiana, in the university area. Lusher is chartered by Advocates for Arts Based Education (AABE), which acts as the board for the entire school. Lusher School has three uptown campuses; the K-5 program is housed at the Willow Street campus, the middle and high schools are both located at the Fortier campus on Freret Street, and a temporary campus was housed at the Jewish Community Center on St. Charles Avenue.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Danielle Dreilinger of <i>The Times Picayune</i> described the school as "exceptionally popular" and "one of the best public elementary schools in Louisiana".

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h3>
<p>Lusher was founded in 1917 and for its first few decades only taught grades K-6 at its Willow Street campus. Then, in 1990, Lusher moved its sixth grade class into the unused Carrollton Courthouse building at 719 South Carrollton Avenue; the school then expanded to include seventh and eighth grades while keeping the Willow Street campus for its K-5 program.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In 2003 however, the school community began discussing the possibility of opening a high school and later began discussing applying to become a charter school. In early August 2005, the school applied to the Orleans Parish School Board to become a charter school. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the schoolâ€™s charter application was granted and the school added grades 9 through 12. Lusher Charter High School opened its doors for the first time on January 17, 2006 with 48 students and only 9th and 10th grades and six high school only teachers (one for each subject: math, science, social studies, English, French and Spanish). The high school was housed at the Carrollton Courthouse with the middle school for its first semester. Due to space limitations at the Carrollton campus, both the middle school and high school had to find a new home. In August 2006, both schools moved to their new campus, the defunct Alcee Fortier High School, on Freret Street.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Filming for <i>Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant</i> took place at Lusher's Fortier campus during spring 2008.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In May, Lusher's first senior class of thirty-five students was offered over two million dollars in college scholarships and included three national merit winners and a semifinalist for a Presidential Scholarship in the Arts. The class of 2011 earned over $11.9 million in scholarship and merit awards. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In summer of 2009, the Brees Family Field was completed with the assistance of Drew and Brittany Brees and the Brees Dream Foundation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>According to the Louisiana Department of Education's academic ratings, Lusher, K-12, was a 4 star high school from 2007-2009 and became a 5 star school (highest possible rating) in 2010. In fall, 2010, Lusher was rated an A+ school by the Louisiana Department of Education and is the highest performing K-12 school in the state of Louisiana.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>As of December 2015 the school did not disclose the name of its admissions test. That month the Louisiana Attorney General ruled that the school must disclose the test's name. In Louisiana schools are not permitted to use IQ tests for admissions purposes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Admissions">Admissions</span></h2>
<p>As of 2014 Kindergarten admissions is based on three levels: the first priority goes to siblings of students already admitted, the second priority goes to residents of the Lusher attendance zone, and the third goes equally to students testing into the school and to children of staff of Tulane University.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 2013 there were 152 spaces for admission and 1,336 applicants for these spaces. In 2015 the kindergarten had 104 spaces, and it had 300 to 350 applicants. When the following were subtracted from the 104 spaces: the 25-35 zoned students, siblings of already admitted students, the 15 students with parents/guardians working for Tulane, and those who scored well on a kindergarten scorecard; only 15 spaces remained for "ordinary" applicants. In 2016 Dreilinger stated that due to the admissions requirements, "the average child, with no special status, has had very little chance of getting in."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>As of 2016 Lusher was one of several New Orleans public schools that did not participate in OneApp, the common application system for New Orleans public schools. Dreilinger stated that Lusher's application procedure was "so complicated that parents have made spreadsheets to keep track of the steps". In 2015 the OPSB voted to require all charter schools to participate in OneApp.

<p>In the post-Hurricane Katrina period, Lusher Charter retained its pre-Katrina attendance boundaries for elementary school students; no such boundary existed for its secondary school. This boundary included parts of Uptown New Orleans, including sections of East Carrollton, and all on-campus residences of Tulane University and Loyola University. In 2016 the kindergarten, which had 104 places, had 25 to 35 students who were zoned to Lusher.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The Greater New Orleans Collaborative of Charter Schools director, Ken Ducote, stated that this boundary may have been established after public schools in New Orleans were desegregated. The attendance boundary was preserved because parents and employees voted to make Lusher a charter school just prior to the hurricane's arrival. All of the other New Orleans schools lost their attendance boundaries after Katrina hit New Orleans. In the post-Katrina period the attendance area, previously economically mixed, became wealthier. In 2010 the board of Lusher Charter voted to extend the attendance boundary so that only Kindergarteners received automatic admissions based on their residences. In 2011 the CEO of Lusher, Kathy Riedlinger, criticized families who moved into Lusher's attendance zone specifically to gain admission for their children, arguing that the attendance zone was only meant to be used by longtime families already living in the area. At that time OPSB officials had discussed the possibility that the attendance zone could be discontinued.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In 2014 members of the Advancement Project filed a federal civil rights complaint that criticized several aspects of New Orleans school admissions, including Lusher Charter's attendance boundary; the group argued that the boundary was intended to inhibit the enrollment of African-Americans. The head of the Louisiana Department of Education, John White, criticized the complaint, referring to it as a "joke". That year Lusher officials stated that the attendance boundary would remain.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>On September 10, 2015 the Orleans Parish School Board voted to end Lusher's attendance boundary effective fall 2017.
