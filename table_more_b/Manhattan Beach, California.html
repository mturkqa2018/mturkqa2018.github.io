<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>In 1863, a Scottish immigrant, Sir Robert Burnett, purchased Rancho Sausal Redondo and Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela from Avila's heirs for $33,000. Ten years later in 1873, Burnett leased the ranch to a Canadian, Daniel Freeman (not the American Daniel Freeman, who was the first to file a claim under the Homestead Act of 1862). Burnett returned to Scotland. Freeman moved his wife and three children onto the ranch and started growing various crops. On May 4, 1885, Freeman bought the ranch from Burnett for $140,000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>George H. Peck owned a lot of the land that became part of the north section of Manhattan Beach. A coin flip decided the town's name. Around 1902, the beach suburb was named "Manhattan" after developer Stewart Merrill's home, the New York City borough of Manhattan. "Beach" was appended to the city's name in 1927 at the behest of the postmaster.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The land in Manhattan Beach was formerly sand dunes. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kuhn Brothers Construction Company leveled uneven sandy sites and some excess sand was sold and shipped to Waikiki, Hawaii, to convert their reef and rock beach into a sandy beach. The sand was also used to build the Los Angeles Coliseum and portions of the Pacific Coast Highway.

<p>Manhattan Beach benefits from ocean breezes that provide clean air and summer temperatures that are 10 to 20 °F (5.6 to 11.1 °C) cooler than the inland regions of Southern California. The Manhattan Beach Unified School District has test scores ranked #3 in the state of California according to California Department of Education statistics. <i>Forbes</i> magazine ranked Manhattan Beach Unified as the sixth best School District in the U.S. According to a July 5, 2014, article in the <i>Beach Reporter</i> newspaper, the city of Manhattan Beach has more educated residents (according to percentage of residents with bachelor's degree or higher) than any other Los Angeles suburb.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Many high-profile individuals in the sports and entertainment industry live in Manhattan Beach due to its oceanfront desirability, top performing school district, and commuting distance to Los Angeles. GQ Magazine named Manhattan Beach one of the nation's six best beaches in their July 2014 issue.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The city has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10 km). Manhattan Beach features 2.1 miles (3.4 km) of ocean frontage.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beach_and_sand_dunes">Beach and sand dunes</span></h3>
<p>Manhattan Beach is a hotspot for beach volleyball and surfing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>A majority of the land in Manhattan Beach was once exposed sand dunes which now lie beneath the city's buildings and streets. The underlying dunes afford residents ocean views throughout western portions of the city. The tallest hill is 244 feet high and located in the city's southwest region. The only remaining exposed sand dune is at Sand Dune Park, where sand resembling the original landscape can also be found. In the late 1920s, Manhattan Beach excess sand was purchased by Hawaiʻian developers, who negotiated a deal with the Kuhn Brothers Construction Company to ship the sand across the Pacific Ocean from Manhattan Beach via Los Angeles Harbor to Waikiki Beach over a 10-year period.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The beach is approximately 400 feet wide and 2.1 miles long. In the early part of the last century, the beach was narrow (approximately 150 feet) and sloping. From 1938 to 1989, it more than doubled in width when large quantities of sand were placed on beaches to the north during construction of the Hyperion Treatment Plant, Marina Del Rey, and Scattergood Power Plant. The sand was carried southward by the ocean's natural littoral flow and widened Manhattan Beach.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Every August, the city hosts the Manhattan Beach Open Volleyball Tournament and the International Surf Festival.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The "Hill Section" is known for its high priced homes where many of the residences are remodeled or newly constructed. The steep hills allow panoramic ocean and city views.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The nearby "Sand Section" is notable for its quiet walk-street neighborhoods adjacent to the ocean. Oceanfront homes stretch along the bike path and walking lane of "The Strand". "The Strand" section of Manhattan Beach includes some of the most expensive real estate per square foot in the United States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Since 2010, new property developments in Manhattan Beach cannot exceed two lot parcels.
