<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>According to its organisers, Open Mic UK is the largest music search in the United Kingdom for vocal groups and solo artists. The competition was originally devised by Chris Grayston as a spin-off from the Live and Unsigned competition as a result of the high number of solo singers and vocalist entrants to that competition, who were without their own songs. Entrants compete in a series of local and regional heats for a chance to perform at the National Grand Final, and the chosen acts in each category compete at the final event. The competition attracts around 10,000 competing acts each year, but in recent years has substantially grown; with an estimated 12,000 acts set to compete in 2015.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The competition can now boast having acts such as Birdy, Luke Friend, Lucy Spraggan and Jahmene Douglas all as winners or having performed within the competition.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Judging">Judging</span></h2>
<p>Acts can perform either covers or their own original material live, and demos and recorded material are not accepted. Judges from the music industry, celebrities and record labels score all performances on the basis of vocal/musical talent, stage performance, star quality, and individuality, and the winning acts in the age categories must earn the most points from judges. There is also a point where the audience can vote in order to aid those in the judges' top scores to make it to the next round of the competition.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Prizes">Prizes</span></h2>

In 2009, this included recording an album in professional studios with an industry vocal specialist. The winner also received a £25,000 investment, a recording contract and a management deal. In 2010, there was an overall £50,000 pool of prizes for winners, with a grand prize investment of up to £30,000. the prize was the same for the 2011 &amp; 2012 competitions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Since the 2013 competition the main prize has been £5,000 for the winner to spend on music development, as well as an extensive publicity &amp; development package.
