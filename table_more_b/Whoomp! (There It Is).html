<p>"<b>Whoomp! (There It Is)</b>" is a song by the Miami bass group Tag Team. The song reached #2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 charts in 1993. The song's critical reception has been mixed, appearing on both best and worst of all time lists. It is frequently parodied and has also become a staple of sporting events. Tag Team tried to prolong the success of "Whoomp! (There It Is)" with Addams Family and Disney versions, but none of those cracked the Top 40 and the group is considered a one-hit wonder.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>The song sampled a beginning synthesizer line from the 1980 Italo disco hit "I'm Ready" by Kano. The chorus is almost the same as the song "Whoot, There It Is" released by fellow Miami-based 95 South a month earlier, but the verse lyrics are very different.  Both songs charted on the <i>Billboard</i> chart at the same time, but "Whoot, There It Is" peaked at #11 and "Whoomp! (There It Is)" peaked at #2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Members of 95 South claim that Tag Team copied their work. "Whoot, There It Is" was released in March 1993, two months before "Whoomp! (There It Is)". Both singles were recorded in Atlanta. Tag Team member DC claimed that the phrase, 'Whoomp! There It Is' was coined by strippers from Florida working in Atlanta. DC was a DJ at an adult entertainment establishment in Georgia during that time. 95 South, however, were Miami-based, which led most to believe DC was either simply lying and knew about the track, or he was actually unaware that the phrase the Florida strippers were repeating in Georgia was from an already-released track. It seemed highly unlikely, if not impossible, for a professional DJ to be unaware of such a widely-played track, especially considering that the Florida strippers he DJed for requested their own music to dance to.

<p>"Whoomp! (There It Is)" was rated #97 in VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders. The song listed at #58 on "Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_video">Music video</span></h2>
<p>The video for the song features a large outdoor party. It was filmed at an Atlanta fairground. Extras were recruited by word-of-mouth and also by an announcement on a local radio station. More than a thousand extras showed up for the shoot.

<p>The song has been featured in many facets of popular culture since its release.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In Brazil, throughout the 1990s, the song's chorus was adapted into a popular crowd chant (phonetically morphed into "uh, tererÃª").
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The song was used extensively during the Philadelphia Phillies run to the 1993 World Series.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The song has also been featured in several films, such as <i>Shark Tale</i>, <i>Beverly Hills Chihuahua</i> and <i>Rio</i> and <i>Elf</i>. DC did not realize that <i>Elf</i> had used the song until he saw the scene, where Will Ferrell dances to the song on top of a mailroom table, until he saw it in theaters.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Derek Dorsett of the Vancouver Canucks used the song as his goal song for the 2015-16 NHL season, as the organization had begun to use specific goal songs for each of its main-stay players.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The Chicago Cubs uses the song when a player hits a home run.

<ul><li>Within a year of the release of "Whoomp! (There It Is)", Tag Team remixed the backing music with a version of the theme song from the original <i>Addams Family</i> television series to create the song "Addams Family (Whoomp!)" for the film <i>Addams Family Values</i>. Actors Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman reprised their film roles as Wednesday Addams and Pugsley Addams (respectively) for the song's music video. This version appears as the closing track on the soundtrack album <i>Addams Family Values: Music from the Motion Picture</i>. "Addams Family (Whoomp!)" won the 1994 Razzie Award (Worst Original Song) for its writers (Ralph Sall, Stephen Gibson and Cecil Glenn).</li>
<li>In 1994, when the Houston Rockets won their first NBA Championship, Tag Team remixed their song yet again. This was titled "Hoop! (There It Is)". It was released on a CD honoring the team by Houston radio station 97.9 The Box and Mobile One.</li>
<li>In 1995, Tag Team made an alternate version of the song called "Whoomp! (There It Went)" together with several Disney characters. It is basically the same song, but with several of its profane lyrics altered for children to depict Donald Duck's party in this version rather than a generic one in the original.</li>
<li>British dance group Clock released a Eurodance cover of the track in July 1995, with the slightly altered title of "Whoomph! (There It Is)".</li>
<li>It was covered in 1998 by Triple S.</li>
<li>In 2001, a UK garage version was released by BM Dubs and Mr Rumble which contained a sample of the Timo Maas remix of "Dooms Night".</li>
<li>The song was again covered in 2005 by Crazy Frog for the album <i>Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits</i>.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chart_performance">Chart performance</span></h2>
<p>The hit song spent one week at #1 on the US R&amp;B chart in 1993. On the Hot 100 chart dated July 10, "Whoomp! (There It Is)" reached a new peak at number two, sandwiched between Janet Jackson's "That's the Way Love Goes" above and UB40's "Can't Help Falling in Love" beneath - all three songs ended up next to each other at the Year-End edition of the chart, occupying exactly the same positions, albeit in slightly different orders. It eventually spent seven weeks at #2 in September through October, 1993 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, but was kept out of the top slot by "Can't Help Falling in Love" and Mariah Carey's "Dreamlover". The single is certified 4Ã— Platinum in the US for shipments of over 4,000,000 copies and, despite never reaching number one on the pop chart, the song spent 24 non-consecutive weeks in the top ten  becoming the longest running top ten song of all time until Toni Braxtonâ€™s â€œUn-Break My Heartâ€ spent a week longer in 1997. It was ranked the second biggest song of 1993, behind Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You". It has sold over 3.5 million copies in the United States.
