<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>The musical is based on the 2007 indie film <i>Waitress</i>. The film was produced on a budget of just $1.5 million, earning over $23 million in global box office receipts. The film starred Keri Russell, and was written and directed by Adrienne Shelly. The film follows Jenna, a waitress and pie chef living in the American South, who unexpectedly becomes pregnant and feels trapped in an unhappy marriage. Looking for a way out, she sees a pie contest and its grand prize as her chance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Following the 2013 Tony Awards, producers Barry and Fran Weissler announced that a musical version of the film was in the works, with Paula Vogel writing the book, Sara Bareilles writing the music and lyrics, and direction by Diane Paulus. The Weisslers purchased the stage rights to the film shortly after its release in 2007. Paula Vogel withdrew from the project in January 2014. On December 11, 2014, the musical was officially confirmed, and it was announced that the show would receive its world premiere at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as part of their 2015â€“2016 season, with Jessie Nelson now writing the book. A workshop was held the same month in New York City, with Jessie Mueller, Keala Settle, Christopher Fitzgerald, Bryce Pinkham and Andy Karl, among others, taking part. Nelson, with the blessing of the late Adrienne Shelly's husband, used some of Shelly's unfinished scripts to help bring "her voice" to the project.

<p>During Cambridge previews, it was announced that the production would transfer to Broadway in March 2016. Broadway previews began on March 25, 2016 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, with the official opening slated for April 24 â€“ just in time for the April 28 Tony Award cut-off date. Tickets went on sale on February 15. Changes to the creative team for the Broadway run included Lorin Latarro replacing Chase Brock as choreographer and Christopher Akerlind replacing Kenneth Posner as lighting designer. For the Broadway production, elements of the book were rewritten, new choreography developed, and a new song written by Bareilles. Manhattan baker Stacy Donnelly and small business owner Dawn Mayo of Everythingdawn Bakery Candles &amp; Treats were hired for the project. Donnelly was hired to ensure that the baking scenes were realistic. She taught the cast how to work and roll pie dough, as the role of Jenna required Mueller to crack eggs, sift flour and roll out dough on stage. Mayo was hired to create all of the realistic prop pies used throughout the show.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>To help immerse audiences, real pies are warming as they enter the theater, creating the aroma of a pie shop; slices of pie are for sale. Cast changes included Nick Cordero taking over the role of Earl, Kimiko Glenn as Dawn, and Christopher Fitzgerald, who took part in the New York workshop, as Ogie. During previews, the production set a new record for a single performance at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, taking in $145,532. The production had required an initial investment of $12 million. During a technical halt at a preview performance, composer and lyricist Sara Bareilles performed two songs, including "Down at the Diner", previously cut from the production.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p><i>Waitress</i> made history on Broadway with the four top creative spots in a show being filled by women (Sara Bareilles, Jessie Nelson, Lorin Latarro, and Diane Paulus). In addition, the costume designer and musical director were women. Sara Bareilles said she was proud to be part of an all-female team: "It's really fun to be an example of the way it can look. We're a bunch of women who are deeply committed to finding a way to build a unified vision." Only the 1978 Broadway musical <i>Runaways</i> had a similar history, with book, music, lyrics, choreography and direction all by Elizabeth Swados.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Synopsis">Synopsis</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Act_I">Act I</span></h3>
<p>Jenna is a  waitress and expert pie baker at Joe's Diner in the  American South who imagines tough situations as pie ingredients (â€œWhat's Insideâ€). She begins another day at the diner with her boss Cal and waitresses Becky and Dawn (â€œOpening Upâ€). After she almost throws up, Becky and Dawn convince her to take a  pregnancy test which, to Jenna's dismay, comes back positive due to a drunken night with her abusive husband, Earl (â€œThe Negativeâ€). Earl comes to the diner and suggests he may make Jenna quit and give up her passion for baking. She decides not to tell him about the pregnancy and recalls her late mother, who also found solace from an unhappy marriage in baking (â€œWhat Baking Can Doâ€).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>At her  OB/GYNâ€™s office, Jenna is taunted by other pregnant women (â€œClub Knocked Upâ€) and meets Dr. Jim Pomatter, a new doctor from Connecticut. Jenna explains she does not want her baby but is going to keep it, and leaves Dr. Pomatter with a Mermaid Marshmallow pie, which, despite the fact that he is off sugar, eats and loves ("Pomatter Pie").
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Word of Jenna's pregnancy reaches Joe, the dinerâ€™s curmudgeonly owner, who suggests she enter a local pie-baking contest with a large reward which would allow her to leave her husband. Dawn has turned to  online dating but is terrified of what could happen (â€œWhen He Sees Meâ€).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Jenna runs into Dr. Pomatter at the bus stop. She tells him about her unhappy marriage, and he compliments her pie and her resilience (â€œIt Only Takes a Tasteâ€). Jenna arrives home to learn Earl has been fired. He berates her, and his anger almost turns physical until she confesses she is pregnant. He makes her promise not to love the baby more than him (â€œYou Will Still Be Mineâ€). Jenna tells Dawn and Becky her plan to enter the pie contest and use the winnings to leave Earl for a new life with the baby. The three waitresses see their dreams of a better life within reach (â€œA Soft Place to Landâ€).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Dawnâ€™s date Ogie visits the diner and insists he get to know Dawn better (â€œNever Ever Getting Rid Of Meâ€). Dawn and Ogie realize they both enjoy American Revolution reenactments and how much they have in common. Jenna makes an appointment with Dr. Pomatter, where she impulsively kisses him. Though both married, they decide to escape their frustrating lives, and have sex in his office (â€œBad Ideaâ€).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Act_II">Act II</span></h3>
<p>After her tryst, Jenna discovers Becky and Cal having sex at the diner. The married Becky is unashamed of giving in to passion (â€œI Didn't Plan Itâ€). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair, as do Becky and Cal, and Dawn and Ogie (â€œBad Idea (Reprise)â€). Jenna wonders if their affair is a mistake, but Dr. Pomatter reassures her (â€œYou Matter To Meâ€). She begins writing a mental note to her baby.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Several months pass and Dawn and Ogie marry (â€œI Love You Like a Tableâ€). At the reception, Jenna asks if Cal, despite his affair, is truly happy; he responds that he is â€œhappy enough.â€ Joe tells Jenna his sincere hopes for her (â€œTake it From an Old Manâ€). Earl drags Jenna home and uncovers the money she has been hiding. She meekly tells him she has been saving for the baby, but Earl leaves with the money (â€œDear Babyâ€). Jenna breaks down, lamenting her long-lost control over her life (â€œShe Used To Be Mineâ€).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Jenna goes into labor. She sees Joe at the hospital on his way to surgery; knowing he is dying, he gives her an envelope to open later. Earl, Becky and Dawn, and even Dr. Pomatter's wife crowd the delivery room, and Jenna cries out in distress. Silence falls, broken by the newbornâ€™s cries ("Contraction Ballet"). Jenna names her daughter Lulu. Earl reminds her of her promise not to love Lulu more than him, and Jenna finally tells him she wants a divorce. He reacts poorly, and she vows to run him over if she ever sees him again. Dr. Pomatter asks Jenna to continue their relationship, but Jenna refuses to remain "happy enough" and ends the affair. As thanks for his positive impact on her life, she gives him a moon pie. Jenna remarks on her change in outlook with Lulu in her life (â€œEverything Changesâ€).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Jenna opens Joeâ€™s note to discover he has left her the diner, asking her to name a pie after him. A few years later, the diner has been rechristened â€œLulu's Piesâ€ and Jenna, the owner and head chef, is content that her life has finally turned around ("Opening Up (Finale)").

<p><i>Waitress</i> features an original score, with music and lyrics by American singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recordings">Recordings</span></h3>
<p>Bareilles recorded her fifth studio album, <i>What's Inside: Songs from Waitress</i>, featuring songs from the musical. It was released through Epic Records on November 6, 2015. The album debuted at number ten on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart with 30,000 equivalent album units in its first week of release, giving Barellies her fifth top-ten album. The lead single from the album, "She Used to Be Mine", was released digitally on September 25, 2015. Speaking about the release of the album, Bareilles stated that her decision to record an album of the songs came because it "proved impossible for me to imagine handing over the songs to the show before selfishly finding a way to sing them myself."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>In April 2016, it was announced that a cast album would be recorded the following month. The original Broadway cast recording was released as a digital download on June 3, and the physical release followed on July 1, 2016. The album was produced by Bareilles with Neal Avron, and recorded by DMI Soundtracks.

<p>The show garnered generally mixed-to-positive reviews in both runs. Frank Rizzo, reviewing the Boston production for <i>Variety</i>, wrote: "...making Earl so relentlessly horrible makes Jenna's inability to leave him not just indecisive but something more worrisome... Meanwhile, there's little evidence for the good doctor being Jenna's lost soulmate, despite his loving bedside manner,... Mueller's performance transcends the show's imperfections. She's funny, frisky and likable. She sings Bareilles' songs beautifully... director Diane Paulus fills the production with clever touches â€“ a scalloped pie-crust proscenium, a fluid and easygoing flow and a natural truthfulness in the performances."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>For the Broadway production, many critics found Bareilles' score and Mueller's performance to be the highlights of the show. Charles Isherwood of <i>The New York Times</i> gave a mixed review of the show, but called Mueller's performance "a high point of the Broadway season". <i>Time Out New York</i> gave the production four stars and said "...<i>Waitress</i> has an excellent ratio of sweet to tart; supporting characters who provide crustiness (Dakin Matthews's grumbly store owner) and flakiness (Christopher Fitzgerald's loony admirer of another waitress); and cooked-to-perfection staging by Diane Paulus. The whole dish isâ€”please forgive meâ€”love at first bite."  David Rooney of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> said "...the material is anchored at every step by Bareilles' melodious pop score and Mueller's supremely natural performance as Jenna. While the stock characters that surround her may be familiar, they're a winsome bunch played by sterling performers..."
