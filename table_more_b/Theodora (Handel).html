<p>Handel wrote <i>Theodora</i> during his last period of composition. He was sixty-four years old when he began working on it in June 1749. He had written the oratorios <i>Solomon</i> and <i>Susanna</i> the previous year. <i>Theodora</i> would be his penultimate oratorio.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p><i>Theodora</i> differs from the former two oratorios because it is a tragedy, ending in the death of the heroine and her converted lover. It is also Handel's only dramatic oratorio in English on a Christian subject.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>

<p>Thomas Morell (1703â€“1784) had worked with Handel before on several oratorios. He and Handel were good friends; the composer left the librettist 200 pounds in his will. Morell's source for the libretto was <i>The Martyrdom of Theodora and of Didymus</i> (1687) by Robert Boyle, a prominent scientist and theologian. He also borrowed from Corneille's <i>ThÃ©odore, Vierge et Martyre</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Handel finished the oratorio on 31 July 1749, and its premiere was on 16 March 1750. <i>Theodora</i> was a failure with the public and only played three times. There are at least two explanations for this. First, the theme of the persecution and martyrdom of a Christian saint may have been too removed from the Old Testament narratives that Londoners had become accustomed to from Handel's dramatic oratorios. Second, an earthquake that transpired about a week before the premiere had caused some of Handel's usual patrons to flee the city.   It was the least performed of all his oratorios, being revived only once in 1755.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Some of Handel's patrons appreciated the work, however. Lord Shaftesbury wrote in a letter to a friend
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<blockquote><p> "I can't conclude a letter and forget "Theodora". I have heard the work three times and will venture to pronounce it as finished, beautiful and labour'd [well worked-out] a composition as ever Handel made. To my knowledge, this took him up a great while in composing. The Town don't like it at all, but ... several excellent musicians think as I do."<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p></blockquote>
<p>One of Handel's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters, Mary Delany, wrote to her sister Ann saying "Don't you remember our snug enjoyment of "Theodora?" Her sister replied "Surely "Theodora" will have justice at last, if it was to be again performed, but the generality of the world have ears and <i>hear not</i>".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>There are two surviving quotes of Handel about <i>Theodora</i>. Morell quotes Handel as saying "The Jews will not come to it because it is a Christian story; and the ladies will not come because it is a virtuous one." Handel's colleague Burney took note when two musicians asked for free tickets for <i>Messiah</i> and Handel responded "Oh your servant, meine Herren! you are damnable dainty! you would not go to <i>Theodora</i> - there was room enough to dance there, when that was perform"!
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p><i>Theodora</i> was actually Handel's favorite of his oratorios. The composer himself ranked the final chorus of Act II, "He saw the lovely youth," "far beyond" "Hallelujah" in <i>Messiah</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>It has sometimes been staged as an opera, most notably in the highly acclaimed 1996 production by Peter Sellars at Glyndebourne. This production, conducted by William Christie, starred Dawn Upshaw as Theodora, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as Irene and David Daniels as Didymus. The plot has some elements of a rescue opera.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The original libretto included an extra scene in which Septimius converted to Christianity himself, but it was never set by Handel, though it was printed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The second scene in Act 2 was also subject to several revisions by Handel.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Act_1">Act 1</span></h3>
<p>The 4th century AD. Valens, the Roman governor of Antioch, issues a decree that in honour of Diocletian's birthday all citizens will offer sacrifice to Venus, the Roman goddess of love, and Flora, a fertility goddess of the spring, on pain of death, and puts Septimius in charge of enforcing this.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Didymus, a soldier secretly converted to Christianity, asks that citizens whose consciences prevent them making sacrifices to idols be spared punishment, which Valens dismisses. Septimius suspects Didymus is a Christian and affirms his own loyalty to the law although he pities those who will be condemned to die by the decree and wishes he could be allowed to extend mercy to them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Theodora, a nobly-born Christian and her friend Irene are worshipping with their fellow believers in private rather than joining in the festival for the emperor's birthday when a messenger brings news of Valens' decree.  Septimius comes to arrest them - Theodora expects to be put to death but is informed that instead she has been sentenced to serve as a prostitute in the temple of Venus. Theodora would much have preferred to die, but is led away to the temple. Irene informs Didymus who goes in the hope of either rescuing her or dying with her. The first Act closes with a chorus of Christians praying for the mission's success.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Act_2">Act 2</span></h3>
<p>At the start of the second Act the festival in honour of the emperor and the goddesses is being enjoyed by the pagans. Valens sends Septimius to tell Theodora that if she doesn't join in with the festival by the end of the day, he will send his guards to rape her. The crowd expresses their satisfaction at this sentence. In the temple of Venus which serves as a brothel, Theodora is frightened, but her mood changes as she contemplates the afterlife. Didymus confesses to his friend and superior officer Septimius that he is a Christian and appeals to the other man's sense of decency. Septimius allows Didymus to visit Theodora. At first Theodora appeals to Didymus to kill her and put an end to her suffering, but instead Didymus persuades her to conceal her identity by putting on his helmet and his uniform and escaping, leaving Didymus in her place. Back at their hideout, Irene and the Christians recall the miracle of The Widow of Nain and hope that, should the lovers die, they will find a new life in heaven.

<p>As the third part opens the Christians celebrate Theodora's safe return. However she feels guilty that she endangered Didymus's life in order to save her own. A messenger informs them Didymus has been captured and that Valens has changed Theodora's punishment to death. Theodora goes to offer herself in Didymus' place, despite the protests of her faithful friend Irene. As Valens sentences Didymus to be executed, Theodora enters demanding that she die and Didymus be saved. Both Didymus and Theodora argue that they should die in place of the other. Septimius is moved by this, and pleads for clemency. Valens, however, condemns both Didymus and Theodora to death and they sing a duet to their immortality.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_and_musical_characterisation">Music and musical characterisation</span></h2>
<p>The oratorio is scored for 2 sections of violins, violas, cellos, double basses, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord, and organ. A harpsichord and violoncello play the continuo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Handel's music gives the choruses of Roman pagans, presented in the libretto as evil people gloating over the torture of Christians, "immense verve and charm". This is contrasted with the quiet, deep conviction of the music for the choruses of Christians. The chorus "He saw the lovely youth", Handel's favorite of all the choruses he wrote, depicts Jesus' raising from the dead of the widow's son in Luke, chapter 7. Beginning with slow and solemn chromatic figures in a minor key, the music switches to major as the youth returns to life and ends with joy as the boy is restored to his mother.
The work is notable for many passages of exalted and radiant beauty as well as for skilled characterisation through music. 
There are three duets, the last being a sublime piece in which Theodora and Didymus die.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Handel uses trumpets, horns, and drums in the Roman scenes. Flutes are introduced in the prison scene, but some arias are very lightly accompanied which raises them far above the text.

<p>(Note: "Symphony" in this context means a purely instrumental piece. "Accompagnato" is a recitative accompanied by the orchestra, rather than by continuo instruments only, as in the passages marked "recitative.")
