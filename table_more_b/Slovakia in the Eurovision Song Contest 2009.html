<p><b>Slovakia</b> returned to the <b>Eurovision Song Contest 2009</b> after an 11-year absence in the Eurovision Song Contest.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>After withdrawing from the Eurovision Song Contest after three poor results from 1994 to 1998, SlovenskÃ¡ TelevÃ­zia (STV) was reluctant to return to the contest due to budget problems in the broadcaster, however, after 11 years, Slovakia returned to the contest in Moscow. The program director of STV stated that pressure from local artists was the driving force behind the country's return.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The fourth Slovak entry at Eurovision was chosen through a national final, held between 15 February and 8 March. the final winner was Kamil MikulÄÃ­k and Nela PociskovÃ¡ with "LeÅ¥ tmou".

<p>A national final was held to select the fourth Slovak Eurovision entry, where the Slovak public will choose the winner through televoting. An open call of songs was launched, with the final deadline for entries to STV expiring at 20 January. All entries submitted to STV will compete in a number of semi-finals held before a grand final, set to be held on 8 March. The original plan was for three semi-finals to be held for <i>Eurosong</i>, set for 15 February, 22 February and 1 March 2009. Thirty songs were to compete in the semi-finals, with four songs qualifying to the final: three of the songs from televoting results while the fourth qualifier decided by a nine-person jury.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>After 117 songs had been entered for <i>Eurosong</i>, STV decided to increase the number of semi-finals to five, each containing 10 songs, a total of 50 competing acts over the five semi-finals. The dates for the semi-finals were Sunday 15 February, Friday 20 February, Sunday 22 February, Friday 27 February and Sunday 1 March. From each semi-final, three songs qualified for the final, two by televoting and one by a jury, with 15 final songs competing in the final. The list of competing songs was released on 3 February.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Semi-final_1">Semi-final 1</span></h3>
<p>The first semi-final of Eurosong was held on 15 February. Three songs qualified to the final from the nine acts that competed, two selected by televoting and one selected by a jury. Desmod &amp; Lucia NovÃ¡kovÃ¡ was supposed to perform during the show, however they did not due to an accident during rehearsals.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Andrea ZimÃ¡nyiovÃ¡ and Robo Å imko &amp; MassRiot were the two acts that qualified by televoting, while VIP was selected by the jury to qualify, after coming ninth and last in the televote.
