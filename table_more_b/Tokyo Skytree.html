<p><b>Tokyo Skytree</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">æ±äº¬ã‚¹ã‚«ã‚¤ãƒ„ãƒªãƒ¼</span><span style="display:none">,</span> <i>TÅkyÅ SukaitsurÄ«</i>)</span> is a broadcasting, restaurant, and observation tower in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan. It became the tallest structure in Japan in 2010 and reached its full height of 634.0 metres (2,080Â ft) in March 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa (829.8Â m/2,722Â ft).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the KantÅ region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012.  The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK.  Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station.  The complex is 7Â km (4.3Â mi) north-east of Tokyo Station.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Design">Design</span></h2>
<p>The design was published on 24 November 2006, based on the following three concepts:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<ul><li>Fusion of neofuturistic design and the traditional beauty of Japan</li>
<li>Catalyst for revitalization of the city</li>
<li>Contribution to disaster prevention â€“ "Safety and Security"</li></ul>
<p>Tokyo Skytree also resembles a 5-storey pagoda from historical Japan. The base of the tower has a structure similar to a tripod; from a height of about 350Â m (1,150Â ft) and above, the tower's structure is cylindrical to offer panoramic views of the river and the city.
There are observatories at 350Â m (1,150Â ft), with a capacity of up to 2000 people, and 450Â m (1,480Â ft), with a capacity of 900 people. The upper observatory features a spiral, glass-covered skywalk in which visitors ascend the last 5 meters to the highest point at the upper platform.  A section of glass flooring gives visitors a direct downward view of the streets below.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Earthquake_resistance">Earthquake resistance</span></h3>
<p>The tower has seismic proofing, including a central shaft made of reinforced concrete. The main internal pillar is attached to the outer tower structure for the first 125 meters (410Â ft) above ground. From there until 375 meters (1,230Â ft) the pillar is attached to the tower frame with oil dampers, which act as cushions during an earthquake. Additional resilience is achieved through an "added mass control mechanism" (or tuned mass damper) â€“ a damping system which, in the event of an earthquake, moves out of step with the building's structure, to keep the center of gravity as central as possible to the tower's base. According to the designers, the dampers can absorb 50 percent of the energy from an earthquake.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Color">Color</span></h3>
<p>The exterior lattice is painted a colour officially called "Skytree White". This is an original colour based on a bluish-white traditional Japanese colour called <i>aijiro</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">è—ç™½</span>)</span>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Illumination">Illumination</span></h3>
<p>The illumination design was published on 16 October 2009. Two illumination patterns <i>Iki</i> (chic, stylish) sky blue and <i>Miyabi</i> (elegance, refinement) purple will be used, alternating daily. The tower is illuminated using LEDs.

<p>From October to November 2007, suggestions were collected from the general public for the name to be given to the tower. On 19 March 2008, a committee chose six final candidate names: <i>TÅkyÅ SukaitsurÄ«</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">æ±äº¬ã‚¹ã‚«ã‚¤ãƒ„ãƒªãƒ¼</span>, "Tokyo sky tree")</span>, <i>TÅkyÅ Edo TawÄ</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">æ±äº¬EDOã‚¿ãƒ¯ãƒ¼</span>, "Tokyo Edo tower")</span>, <i>Raijingu TawÄ</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">ãƒ©ã‚¤ã‚¸ãƒ³ã‚°ã‚¿ãƒ¯ãƒ¼</span>, "Rising tower")</span>, <i>Mirai TawÄ</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">ã¿ã‚‰ã„ã‚¿ãƒ¯ãƒ¼</span>, "Tower of the future")</span>, <i>Yumemi Yagura</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">ã‚†ã‚ã¿ã‚„ãã‚‰</span>, "Dream lookout")</span>, <i>Raijingu Äªsuto TawÄ</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">ãƒ©ã‚¤ã‚¸ãƒ³ã‚°ã‚¤ãƒ¼ã‚¹ãƒˆã‚¿ãƒ¯ãƒ¼</span>, "Rising east tower")</span>.  The official name was decided in a nationwide vote, and was announced on 10 June 2008 as "Tokyo Skytree". The name received around 33,000 votes (30%) out of 110,000 cast, with the second most popular name being "Tokyo Edo Tower".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The height of 634Â m (2,080Â ft) was selected to be easily remembered. The figures 6 (mu), 3 (sa), 4 (shi) stand for "Musashi", an old name of the region where the Tokyo Skytree stands.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Opening">Opening</span></h2>
<p>As the Skytree's opening approached, people reportedly waited in line for a week to get tickets. By the opening, trips up the tower were fully booked for the first two months of operation.  The opening day drew a crowd of tens of thousands, despite rainy conditions which blocked the view from the tower's observation deck. Strong winds also forced two elevators to be shut down, leaving some visitors briefly stranded on the observation deck.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>According to Tobu, 1.6 million people visited Skytree in its first week.  Local residents reported that the influx of visitors disturbed the peace of their community and had, so far, generated little economic benefit for the local area.
