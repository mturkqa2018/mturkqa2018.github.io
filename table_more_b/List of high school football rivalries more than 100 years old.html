The game is held at Mitchell Stadium, which is within West Virginia by a mere 500 feet but serves as the home stadium for both schools throughout the season. The first match between the two teams was held in 1911 and was the only game played that year. The rivalry resumed between Bluefield and Graham in 1928 and has been played continuously ever since. In 1991, the two schools were featured on the ESPN show "Scholastic Sports America" as having one of the largest high school football rivalries on the east coast. The annual meeting between the two schools is also a long-running featured battle in the Great American Rivalry Series. Drawing crowds of 10,000+ each season, the game is the talk of the town year after year with alumni from both schools traveling back home from around the globe just to attend the contest. The Bluefield Beavers hold a winning record over the Graham G-Men.
