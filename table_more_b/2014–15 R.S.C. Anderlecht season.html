<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pre-season">Pre-season</span></h3>
<p>It was announced that Anderlecht would play six matches in preparation for the 2014-15 season, with games against Royal Knokke, Oudenaarde, Mons, Dynamo Kyiv, RFC LiÃ¨ge and Deinze with the pre-season matches starting from 28 June 2014 and ending on 22 July 2014.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Anderlecht kicked off their pre-season campaign with a 1-4 victory away to Royal Knokke on 28 June at Stadion Olivier. The club followed that with a 0-2 win at Oudenaarde, with goals coming from Youri Tielemans and Frank Acheampong. Anderlecht then drew 0-0 with Mons in match remembered less so for the result but more so for the return of MatÃ­as SuÃ¡rez who had been out injured since October 2013 due to a serious knee injury he suffered in training at that time. On 11 July, Anderlecht faced Dynamo Kyiv in Austria. A match they won 2-1 thanks to a brace from Frank Acheampong.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>On the following Wednesday, Anderlecht won their penultimate pre-season fixture when they beat RFC LiÃ¨ge 0-2 at the Stade du Pairay, with goals coming from Aleksandar MitroviÄ‡ and Samuel Armenteros. Anderlecht won their sixth and final friendly match on July 22, beating Deinze 0-1 at the Burgemeester Van de Wiele Stadion thanks to a goal from Nathan Kabasele. Which meant the club ended pre-season unbeaten, winning five and drawing just one.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transfers">Transfers</span></h4>
<p>Anderlecht's first summer signing was Brazilian Wigor Alan do Nascimento who was signed from Brazilian club Capivariano after a successful trial. The club also signed goalkeeper Mulopo Kudimbana on a permanent contract in June, with the Congolese international joining from Oostende. Samuel Armenteros, MichaÃ«l Heylen, Mehdi Tarfi and Fede Vico all returned from their loan spells at Feyenoord, Kortrijk, Zulte Waregem and Oostende respectively while Demy de Zeeuw left in the opposite direction following the completion of his loan spell from Spartak Moscow.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Numerous outgoings were completed also. Fernando Canesin completed a permanent transfer to Oostende, Nabil Jaadi left the club to join Italian Serie A side Udinese while Jordan Lukaku joined Oostende permanently after a successful loan spell. Four other players also completed permanent moves away from the club, Massimo Bruno to Red Bull Salzburg, Cheikhou KouyatÃ© to West Ham United, David Pollet to Gent and Dalibor VeselinoviÄ‡ to Mechelen. Elis Koulibaly and Youri Lapage were loaned to Eendracht Aalst, the Belgian Second Division side also claimed to have signed Jonathan Kindermans on loan but Anderlecht later confirmed Kindermans was to join Eerste Divisie side Telstar on loan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Guillaume Gillet also left the club on loan, he joined French Ligue 1 side Bastia on a season-long loan deal on 10 July.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="July">July</span></h3>
<p>On 20 July, Anderlecht played their first competitive fixture of the season in the 2014 Belgian Super Cup against Lokeren, a match they won 2-1 at their home ground of Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. Aleksandar MitroviÄ‡ gave Anderlecht the early lead on twenty-nine minutes after a byline pass from Cyriac. Lokeren equalised on seventy-three minutes thanks to a looping header from Tunisian striker Hamdi Harbaoui. As the match was heading for extra time Anderlecht found a ninety first-minute winner, Andy Najar put in a cross which was met by Lokeren's Denis Odoi who put the ball into his own net for an own goal. That won Anderlecht their twelfth Belgian Super Cup triumph.
