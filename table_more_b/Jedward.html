<p>In 2008 John and Edward formed a duo and the following year they auditioned in Glasgow as a group for the sixth series of <i>The X Factor</i>, under the name John &amp; Edward. Despite being described by judge Simon Cowell as "not very good and incredibly annoying", John &amp; Edward were put through to bootcamp, then made it to judges' houses, where Louis Walsh selected them for the live shows. The twins' inclusion in the final 12 was a controversial decision, due to their lack of experience, but Walsh stood by them, saying "I don't know how people can hate two nice young kids from Ireland. They've been edited really badly and come across as the people everyone loves to hate... but they're just raw, naïve and innocent and they have the potential to be really good." John &amp; Edward became known for their unpolished but enthusiastic performances, famously including a version of Britney Spears' "Oops!... I Did It Again", during which they reenacted the <i>Titanic</i> monologue. After their departure from <i>The X Factor</i>, Jedward were signed to Modest! Management, however it was later announced that Louis Walsh had reached "an amicable agreement", which allowed him to take the twins on.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>From February until April 2010, they performed on the <i>X Factor</i> Live tour, where they were credited with the boost in demand for tickets, that led to an extension in the tour run. Their debut single "Under Pressure (Ice Ice Baby)" was a mashup of "Under Pressure" and "Ice Ice Baby", with Vanilla Ice contributing guest vocals. In March Jedward's Sony contract ended, but the following day Universal Music Ireland signed them on a three-album contract. In April 2010, Jedward began their first solo tour, a 27-date tour of Ireland called the Planet Jedward Tour. Due to popular demand, it was extended with a second 43-date leg in the UK and Ireland. The <i>Irish Independent</i> rated the tour positively, saying that "Jedwardmania is right up there with Beatlemania." Jedward's second single, a cover of the Blink-182 song "All the Small Things", was released in July 2010 and peaked at number 21 on the Irish charts and number 6 on the UK Indie Chart. The same week, Jedward released their debut album <i>Planet Jedward</i>, consisting of cover versions. It which went straight to number one on the  Irish Albums Chart and number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. In August 2010, Jedward appeared in their own ITV2 documentary, entitled <i>Jedward: Let Loose</i>, a three-part series in which they moved out of their home for ten days.

<p>Their fans include Pixie Lott and Robbie Williams. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also backed the singers, while Leona Lewis said that she worried about them. Two leading British political parties, Labour and the Conservatives, each released campaign posters parodying the twins. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown came under fire in November 2009 for describing Jedward as "not very good" and later apologised for doing so. Following this, Walsh stated "So Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell both have something in common: neither of them know what the public want." Former Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that he enjoyed watching <i>The X Factor</i> and that Jedward were his favourite act. Cameron also bought a T-shirt with their faces on it. <i>The Irish Independent</i> called Jedward "tone-deaf twins", even though the pair were voted more popular than The Beatles in a teenage poll. Comedian Oliver Callan has parodied them on his RTÉ 2 show <i>Nob Nation</i>. Their 2017 court case was later the subject of a stage musical starring comedians Kevin McGahern and Tony Cantwell.
