<p><b>Avenged Sevenfold</b> (sometimes abbreviated as <b>A7X</b>) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i> and continued this sound through their second album <i>Waking the Fallen</i>. However, Avenged Sevenfold's style had evolved by the band's third album and first major label release, <i>City of Evil</i>, into a heavy metal and hard rock style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, James "The Rev" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), and released and toured in support of its fifth album <i>Nightmare</i> in 2010, which debuted on the top spot of the <i>Billboard</i> 200, Avenged Sevenfold's first number one debut. In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. Avenged Sevenfold's sixth studio album <i>Hail to the King</i>, which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Arin Ilejay. <i>Hail to the King</i> charted as number 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change wasn't announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album titled <i>The Stage</i> on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart in the US. <i>The Stage</i> is their first conceptual album and it marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards the progressive metal sound.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>To date, Avenged Sevenfold has released seven studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide. Avenged Sevenfold was ranked No. 47 on <i>Loudwire's</i> list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time. Avenged Sevenfold have released an original song for each game in the <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> series.

<p>The band was formed in March 1999 in Huntington Beach, California by Matt Sanders, The Rev and Matt Wendt. Although they are not a religious band, Sanders came up with the name as a reference to the story of Cain and Abel from the Bible, which can be found in Genesis 4:24. Shortly after their formation, they were joined by an acquaintance from high school, Zachary Baker, who played in the punk-band MPA at the time.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Avenged Sevenfold's first creative output was a three-track-demo, some months later, they were asked by Sadistic Records to contribute to two compilations. To that end, they recorded two new songs and released them along with the previously recorded songs on a second demo in early 2000. They sent this demo to the Belgian label Good Life Recordings and were subsequently signed. Shortly afterward, Matt Wendt left for college and Justin Meacham, the previous bassist of Suburban Legends joined Avenged Sevenfold. In late 2000, the foursome took on their initial stage names and recorded their debut album, <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i>. In early 2001, lead guitarist and old friend Synyster Gates joined the band and they re-recorded the introductory track "To End the Rapture" for the album's lead-single/EP, <i>Warmness on the Soul</i>, released in April. Although their debut album was initially planned for a late April release, it was pushed back multiple times and eventually released in June or July 2001 on Good Life Recordings.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Around August 2001, Meacham attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt was the reason for Avenged Sevenfold to join the Take Action Tour in 2003. During Meacham's hospitalization, he remained in poor condition and had to leave the band. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all around you, and it makes you want to do something to prevent it from happening to other people." His replacement was Dameon Ash, who performed with the band for the following months, but does not appear on any releases.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>On January 18, 2002, Avenged Sevenfold left Good Life Recordings and signed with Hopeless Records. They re-released their debut album on March 19 and also appeared on the <i>Hopelessly Devoted To You Vol. 4</i> sampler in April. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall. They spent the year touring in support of their debut album and participated in the Vans Warped and Take Action tours. Towards the end of the year, Dameon Ash left Avenged Sevenfold and in November, their current bassist Johnny Christ joined them, completing their best known line-up.

<p>Having found a new bassist, the group released their second studio album titled <i>Waking the Fallen</i> on Hopeless Records in August 2003. The album featured a more refined and mature sound production in comparison to their previous album. The band received profiles in <i>Billboard</i> and <i>The Boston Globe</i>, and again played on the Vans Warped and Take Action tours. In 2004, Avenged Sevenfold toured again on the Vans Warped Tour and recorded a video for their song "Unholy Confessions" which went into rotation on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball. Shortly after the release of <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, Avenged Sevenfold left Hopeless Records and were officially signed to Warner Bros. Records on November 1, 2003.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p><i>City of Evil</i>, the band's third album and major label debut, was released on June 7, 2005 and debuted at No.30 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, selling over 30,000 copies in its first week of release. It utilized a more classic metal sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous albums, which had been grouped into the metalcore genre. The album is also notable for the absence of screamed and growled vocals; M. Shadows worked with vocal coach Ron Anderson—whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell—for months before the album's release to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having the tone". The album received positive reviews from several magazines and websites and is credited for propelling the band into international popularity.

<p>After playing Ozzfest in 2006, Avenged Sevenfold memorably beat out R&amp;B Singers Rihanna and Chris Brown, Panic! at the Disco, Angels &amp; Airwaves and James Blunt for the title of Best New Artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, thanks in part to their Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas-inspired song "Bat Country." They returned to the Vans Warped Tour, this time headlining and then continued on their own "Cities of Evil Tour." In addition, their lead single "Bat Country" reached No.2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Rock Charts, No.6 on the <i>Billboard</i> Modern Rock Charts and the accompanying video made it to No.1 on MTV's Total Request Live. Propelled by this success, the album sold well and became Avenged Sevenfold's first gold record. It was later certified platinum in August 2009.
Avenged Sevenfold was invited to join Ozzfest tour on the main stage, alongside other well known rock/heavy metal acts such as DragonForce, Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Disturbed and System of a Down for the first time in 2006. That same year they also completed a worldwide tour, including the US, The United Kingdom (as well as mainland Europe), Japan, Australia and New Zealand. After a sixteen-month promotion of <i>City of Evil</i>, the band announced that they were cancelling their Fall 2006 tour to record new music. In the interim, the band released their first DVD titled <i>All Excess</i> on July 17, 2007. <i>All Excess</i>, which debuted as the No.1 DVD in the USA, included live performances and backstage footage that spanned the band's eight-year career. Two tribute albums, <i>Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: Bat Wings and Broken Strings</i> and <i>Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: The String Tribute</i> were also released in October 2007.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>On October 30, 2007, Avenged Sevenfold released their self-titled album, the band's fourth studio album. It debuted at No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with over 90,000 copies sold. Two singles, "Critical Acclaim" and "Almost Easy" were released prior to the album's debut. In December 2007, an animated video was made for "A Little Piece of Heaven". Due to the song's controversial subject matter, however, Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, "Afterlife" and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, "Dear God", was released on June 15, 2008. Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and was awarded "Album of the Year" at the Kerrang! Awards.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour with Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, Blessthefall and Idiot Pilot. They used the footage from their last show in Long Beach for <i>Live in the LBC &amp; Diamonds in the Rough</i>, a two-disc B-sides CD and live DVD which was released on September 16, 2008.

Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an "acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol". In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the death of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan's family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</span></h2>
<p>Members of Avenged Sevenfold cite In Flames, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Slayer, Elton John, Leonard Cohen, At the Gates, Helloween, Pennywise, NOFX, Pantera, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, The Beatles, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and the Rolling Stones as influences.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i> consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound. However, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in "Streets", which shows a punk rock style, and "Warmness on the Soul", which is a piano ballad. On <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD <i>All Excess</i>, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: "When I met the band after <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i> had come out before they had recorded <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>On <i>City of Evil</i>, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from <i>City of Evil</i>, most notably in "Dear God", which shows a country style and "A Little Piece of Heaven", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. <i>Nightmare</i> contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called "Fiction", progressive metal-oriented track "Save Me" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on "God Hates Us". The band's sixth studio album <i>Hail to the King</i> shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album <i>The Stage</i>, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Avenged Sevenfold has been criticized for "not being metal enough". In response to this, vocalist M. Shadows said: "we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.
