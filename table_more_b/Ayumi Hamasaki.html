<p><b>Ayumi Hamasaki</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">æµœå´Žã‚ã‚†ã¿</span><span style="display:none">,</span> <i>Hamasaki Ayumi</i>, born October 2, 1978)</span> is a Japanese singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, model, spokesperson and entrepreneur. Through her entire career, she has written almost all her lyrical content, and has sometimes composed her music.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Born and raised in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki moved to Tokyo at fourteen in 1993 to pursue a career in singing and acting. In 1998, under the tutelage of Avex CEO Max Matsuura, Hamasaki released her debut single "Poker Face" and debut major-label album <i>A Song for XX</i>. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, <i>Duty,</i> selling nearly three million. <i>A Best</i>, her first compilation album, is her best-selling album, with more than four million copies sold in Japan. Since 2006, after her album <i>Secret</i> was released, album and single sales have declined.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Hamasaki has sold over 50 million records, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist of all time. Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (twenty-five), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the charts. Hamasaki is the first female recording artist to have ten studio albums since her debut to top the Oricon and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut. Hamasaki's second remix album, <i>Super Eurobeat Presents Ayu-ro Mix</i>, is recognized as one of the best selling remix albums of all time and remains her only album to be recognized in a worldwide accreditation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>During the height of her career, Hamasaki has been dubbed as the "Empress of J-pop" because of her popularity in Japan and Asia. Following an ear infection in 2000, she has suffered worsening hearing loss and is completely deaf in one ear.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Childhood_and_early_endeavors">Childhood and early endeavors</span></h3>
<p>Born in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki was raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother. Her father had left the family when she was three and never again came into contact with her. Hamasaki's mother worked to support the family, so Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother. She described herself as a "tomboy" when she was a teenager, and as a â€œstrange kidâ€ who â€œliked to be aloneâ€.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>At age seven, Hamasaki began modeling for local institutions, such as banks, in order to supplement the family's income. She continued this career path by leaving her family at fourteen and moving to Tokyo as a model under SOS, a talent agency. Her modeling career did not last long; SOS eventually deemed her too short for a model and transferred her to Sun Music, a musicians' agency. Under the name of "Ayumi", Hamasaki released a rap EP, <i>Nothing from Nothing</i>, on the Nippon Columbia label in 1995. She was dismissed from the label when the album failed to chart on the Oricon. After this failure, Hamasaki took up acting and starred in B-movies such as <i>Ladys Ladys!! SÅcho Saigo no Hi</i> and television dramas such as <i>Miseinen</i>, which were poorly received by the public. From August 1995 to March 1996, Hamasaki also co-hosted the SoundLink "magazine" <i>HÅkago no ÅŒsama</i> (<i>After-school King</i>) for the Nintendo Satellaview once a week with Shigeru Izumiya. Growing dissatisfied with her job, Hamasaki quit acting and moved in with her mother, who had recently moved to Tokyo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Hamasaki was initially a good student, earning good grades in junior high school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped out in the first year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>At Velfarre, she was introduced to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.

<h3><span id="1998.E2.80.9399:_Musical_beginnings.2C_A_Song_for_xx_and_Loveppears"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="1998â€“99:_Musical_beginnings,_A_Song_for_xx_and_Loveppears">1998â€“99: Musical beginnings, <i>A Song for xx</i> and <i>Loveppears</i></span></h3>
<p>Hamasaki made her debut under Avex at 19 on April 8, 1998 with the single "Poker Face". Itâ€”and the following four singlesâ€”were not major hits, however each release was better than the last, thus gradually increasing her exposure and presence on the market. Hamasaki's debut album, <i>A Song for Ã—Ã—</i> (1999), was likewise "unassuming": the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of Da Pump), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of Every Little Thing), were "cautious" pop-rock songs. However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public. The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies. For her achievements, she earned a Japan Gold Disc Award for "Best New Artist of the Year".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>With <i>Ayu-mi-x</i> (March 1999), the first of a series of remix albums, Hamasaki began moving beyond the pop-rock of <i>A Song for Ã—Ã—</i> and began to incorporate different styles including trance, dance, and orchestra. Hamasaki began to experiment with different musical styles in her singles as well, releasing dance tunes and ballads as well as remixes on the singles which spanned reggae and house. The singles were milestones: Hamasaki earned her first number-one single ("Love: Destiny") and first million-selling single ("A"). Her second studio album, <i>Loveppears</i> (November 1999), not only topped the Oricon charts, it sold nearly 3 million copies. The album also showcased a change in Hamasaki's lyrics. Though the lyrics of <i>Loveppears</i> still dealt with loneliness, many of them were written from a third-person perspective. In support of <i>Loveppears</i>, she held her first tour, <i>Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 A</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>A Film for XX is the first video clip collection by Ayumi Hamasaki, it was released on September 15, 1999.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span id="2000.E2.80.9302:_Duty.2C_compilation_releases.2C_I_Am..._and_Rainbow"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="2000â€“02:_Duty,_compilation_releases,_I_Am..._and_Rainbow">2000â€“02: <i>Duty</i>, compilation releases, <i>I Am...</i> and <i>Rainbow</i></span></h3>
<p>From April to June 2000, Hamasaki released the "Trilogy", a series of singles consisting of "Vogue", "Far Away", and "Seasons". The lyrics of these songs focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a sense of shame of her public image. Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album, <i>Duty</i> (September 2000), involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities. She described her feelings after the writing as "unnatural" and "nervous". The musical style was darker as well; in contrast with <i>Loveppears</i>, <i>Duty</i> was a rock-influenced album with only one dance song, "Audience". <i>Duty</i> resonated with fans: the "Trilogy" were "hit singles" ("Seasons" was a million-seller), and the album became Hamasaki's best-selling studio album. At the end of 2000, Hamasaki held her first New Year countdown concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In 2001, Avex forced Hamasaki to release her first compilation album, <i>A Best</i>, on March 28, putting the album in "competition" with Hikaru Utada's second studio album, <i>Distance</i>. The "competition" between the two singers (which both claimed was merely a creation of their record companies and the media) was supposedly the reason for the success of the albums; both sold over 5 million copies. In support of <i>Duty</i> and <i>A Best</i>, Hamasaki held a tour of Japan's domes, making her one of few "top-drawer" Japanese artists to hold a concert at the Tokyo Dome.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<p><i>I Am...</i> (January 2002) marked several milestones for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased her control over her music by composing all of the songs on the album under the pseudonym "Crea", of which the 2000 single "M" was the first. "Connected" (November 2002) and "A Song Is Born" (December 2001) were the exceptions. <i>I Am...</i> also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of "loneliness and confusion" of some of her earlier songs. Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of <i>I Am...</i>, focusing on issues such as faith and world peace. "A Song Is Born", in particular, was directly influenced by the events. The single, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex's non-profit Song Nation project, which raised money for charity. She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a "peace muse", explaining, <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><blockquote><p>I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed my mind. I knew it wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes. It sounds odd coming from me, but I realize what I say and how I look has a great impact.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The outlook inspired by the September 11 attacks extended beyond <i>I Am...</i>. In 2002, Hamasaki held her first concert outside Japan, at the MTV Asia music awards ceremony in Singapore, a move interpreted as the beginning of a campaign prompted by a sluggish Japanese market. At the ceremony, she received the award for "Most Influential Japanese Singer in Asia". In support of <i>I Am...</i>, Hamasaki held two tours, <i>Ayumi Hamasaki Arena Tour 2002 A</i> and <i>Ayumi Hamasaki Stadium Tour 2002 A</i>. In November 2002, as "Ayu", she released her first European single, "Connected", a trance song from <i>I Am...</i> composed by DJ Ferry Corsten. It was released in Germany on the Drizzly label. Hamasaki continued to release singles (all of them remixes of previously released songs) in Germany on Drizzly until 2005.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In April 2002, Hamasaki released the single "Free &amp; Easy". In collaboration with the magazine <i>Free&amp;Easy</i>, Hamasaki also released <i>Hamasaki Republic</i>, a photobook that was actually a special issue of <i>Free&amp;Easy</i>, in conjunction with the single. "H", Hamasaki's next single, became the best-selling single of 2002. Hamasaki released her last single of 2002, "Voyage", on September 26. In lieu of a regular-length music video, the short film <i>Tsuki ni Shizumu</i>, starring Hamasaki, was created for "Voyage" and was released at a select theater in Shibuya. Hamasaki's next studio album, <i>Rainbow</i> (December 2002) was her first to use English lyrics. After performing at the 2002 MTV Asia music awards, Hamasaki felt that by writing only Japanese lyrics, she was not able to bring her "message" to other countries. Realizing that English was a "common global language", she included English lyrics in three songs. The album was stylistically diverse; Hamasaki included rock- and trip hop-influenced tracks as well as "summery", "up-tempo" and "grand gothic" songs and experimented with new techniques such as gospel choruses and the yells of an audience. The lyrics were also varied: themes in the album included freedom, the struggles of women, and "a summer that ends in sadness".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h3><span id="2003.E2.80.9306:_Decline_in_sales.2C_My_Story.2C_.28Miss.29Understood_and_Secret"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="2003â€“06:_Decline_in_sales,_My_Story,_(Miss)Understood_and_Secret">2003â€“06: Decline in sales, <i>My Story</i>, <i>(Miss)Understood</i> and <i>Secret</i></span></h3>
<p>In 2003, Hamasaki released three singles, "&amp;", "Forgiveness", and "No Way to Say". To celebrate the release of her thirtieth single ("Forgiveness"), Hamasaki held the <i>A Museum</i> concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium. Her mini-album <i>Memorial Address</i> (December 2003) was her first album to be released in CD+DVD format in addition to the regular CD-only format, a decision that came from her increased interest in the direction of her music videos. Like her previous albums, <i>Memorial Address</i> topped the Oricon chart and sold over a million copies. Sales of Hamasaki's singles began to wane. Although all three of the album's singles topped the Oricon charts, "&amp;" was Hamasaki's last single to sell over 500,000 copies.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>By the end of her <i>Arena Tour 2003â€“2004</i>, Hamasaki had grown dissatisfied with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person. Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin work on <i>My Story</i> (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, <i>My Story</i> had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write "something good" or even "something that would give people hope"; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly. As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album's notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music. She was so pleased with the result that she declared <i>My Story</i> the first album she felt satisfied with. <i>My Story</i> and its singles, "Moments", "Inspire", and "Carols", all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, <i>My Story</i> became Hamasaki's last million-selling studio album according to Oricon. From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide <i>My Story</i> arena tour, her first album-based tour. Also in January, she began working with Lamoureux Orchestra to create <i>My Story Classical</i>, a classical version of <i>My Story</i>; the album served as an "alter-ego" of the mostly aggressive <i>My Story</i>. The orchestra also created a classical version of "A Song Is Born", which was included on <i>My Story Classical</i> and which Hamasaki performed at the opening of the Expo 2005.

<p><i>(Miss)understood</i> (January 2006), Hamasaki's seventh studio album, showed new musical directions. Wanting to sing a tune like those of the group Sweetbox, Hamasaki obtained the permission of Sweetbox composer Roberto "Geo" Rosan to use demo songs he had intended to use in Sweetbox's upcoming album. She edited the songs to fit her personal vision, rewriting the lyrics and rearranging some of the songs. The result was more musically diverse than the previous album; <i>(Miss)understood</i> included ballads, funk, dance-pop, R&amp;B, and rock songs. All of <i>(Miss)understood'</i>s singles reached the top of the Oricon; "Bold &amp; Delicious" became Hamasaki's twenty-fifth number-one single, tying her with Seiko Matsuda for the record of most number-one singles by a solo female artist. Though <i>(Miss)understood</i> also reached the top of the charts, Oricon stated that it sold fewer than a million copiesâ€”Hamasaki's first studio album to do so. In support of the album, Hamasaki held the <i>(Miss)understood</i> arena tour, which spanned three months with thirty concerts, from Saitama on March 11, 2006, to Yoyogi on June 11, 2006.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Hamasaki's first single of 2006, "Startin'", became Hamasaki's twenty-sixth number-one single, setting a new record for most number-one singles held by a solo female artist. The subsequent studio album, <i>Secret</i>, was released in November 2006. "Secrets" was, appropriately, the theme of the album; the album also explored strong female figures, love, and sadness; songs depicted the artist's struggles and were written to encourage women. Although <i>Secret</i> was originally intended to be a mini-album, Hamasaki "began brimming with things to say" while producing the album and wrote five more songs. The album consisted mostly of rock songs and ballads; to complement these, Hamasaki experimented with new vocal techniques. The album also topped the Oricon weekly charts, making Hamasaki the only artist to have eight consecutive number-one studio albums. Her sales, however, continued to decline: according to both Oricon and the RIAJ, <i>Secret</i> failed to sell a million copies.

<p>On February 28, 2007, Hamasaki released <i>A Best 2</i>, a pair of compilation albums containing songs from <i>I Am...</i> to <i>(Miss)understood</i>. The two versions, <i>White</i> and <i>Black</i>, debuted at the first and second positions on the Oricon weekly charts, making Hamasaki the first female artist in thirty-six years to hold the top two positions on any Oricon album chart. At the end of 2007, the pair became Japan's fifth and seventh best-selling albums of the year respectively. In support of <i>A Best 2</i> and <i>Secret</i>, Hamasaki held the four-month-long <i>Tour of Secret</i> from March to the end of June. It was her first international tour, and aside from Japan, she performed in Taipei, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Her foreign fanbase highly anticipated the concerts, and tickets for the Taipei and Hong Kong performances sold out in less than three hours.

<p>In July 2007, Hamasaki released her first single in over a year, "Glitter/Fated". A short film, <i>Distance Love</i>, was used as the music video for "Glitter" and "Fated". The film, shot in Hong Kong, co-starred Hong Kong actor Shawn Yue as Hamasaki's romantic interest. "Glitter/Fated" and the following single "Talkin' 2 Myself" reached the top of their respective charts, continuing Hamasaki's streak of number-one singles. In December, Hamasaki released her first digital-only single, "Together When...", which topped the RIAJ's monthly download chart. Unlike its predecessors, the writing of Hamasaki's ninth studio album, <i>Guilty</i> (January 2008), was not an emotional experience for her, nor did it have a set theme. However, she said later that the album's tracks appeared to tell a story. Most of the songs were dark; the album had a notable rock tinge. It contained some upbeat dance tracks and ballads, though the latter also had rock overtones. <i>Guilty</i> peaked at the number-two position on the weekly Oricon charts, making it Hamasaki's first studio album not to reach the top and ended Hamasaki's streak of 8 consecutive number-one albums. <i>Guilty</i> was later released as a digital album in twenty-six countries outside Japan, nineteen of them Western nations. That, along with Hamasaki's decision to employ western DJs such as The Young Punx, Coldcut, Para One and Armand Van Helden for her 2008 remix albums <i>Ayu-mi-x 6: Gold</i> and <i>Ayu-mi-x 6: Silver</i>, has been interpreted as her first step into the global market.

<p>From April 7, 2018 to July 22, 2018, Hamasaki embarked on her arena tour titled Power of Music, in celebration of her 20th anniversary.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>In July 2018, Hamasaki participated in a special concert alongside the likes of Crystal Kay, Daichi Miura, LiSA, as well as King &amp; Prince. Later that same month, she announced the release of her seventh extended play, TROUBLE, which was released on August 15, 2018.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Image_and_artistry">Image and artistry</span></h2>
<p><i>Time</i> magazine has noted that Hamasaki lacked talents such as the dance moves of Namie Amuro, the "supermodel allure" of Hitomi, and the "vocal pyrotechnics" of Hikaru Utada. Her own fans even considered her high-pitched voice screechy. However, her music is sometimes considered one of the major forces in shaping Japan's current music trends; this has been attributed to her constantly changing image as well as her self-penned lyrics, though critics credit clever marketing strategies. Hamasaki is also noted for the visual aspects of her artistry: she is considered a fashion trendsetter, with her influence extending beyond Japan. <i>The Guardian</i> says that Hamasaki has "married accessible, mainstream hits with over-the-top costumes and high-concept videos". The widespread influence of her music and her constantly changing image has meant that Hamasaki has often been compared to Madonna.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>Hamasaki's lyrics and image have gained a following predominantly among the Generation X of Asia, mainly because of the "conflicting or inharmonious beauty" of her fashion and lyrics; Hamasaki's fashions combine Eastern and Western elements, and her songs, unlike those of many of her contemporaries, mostly all have English titles but contained no English lyrics (until <i>Rainbow</i>). Music critic Tetsu Misaki believed that the juxtaposition of her fashionable appearance and her personal lyrics was one of her most important selling points. The popularity of her music extends beyond Japan; she has a "sizable [following] across Asia" and is one of the few Japanese singers whose albums have sold over 10,000 copies in Singapore. In 2002, however, Hamasaki's domestic sales began declining due to a sluggish Japanese market and increasing piracy in Japan. As a result, she began moving toward the Asian market in 2002, performing at the 2002 MTV Asia awards in Singapore, at South Korea's "Asia Song Festival", and at a concert in Beijing to celebrate Sino-Japanese relations. With her popularity declining (due in part to the rising popularity of other singers), she made a foray into the Asian market, starting with her first tour of Asia in 2007.

<div class="quotebox-quote left-aligned" style="">In the beginning, I was searching for myself in my music. My music was for me. I didn't have the mental room to be conscious of the listener; I wrote to save myself. I didn't understand what it was to write songs. But over time I began to see many things, my influence, the responsibilities that gave me.</div>
<p><cite class="right-aligned" style="">â€” Hamasaki on the new lyrical directions in <i>I Am...</i>.</cite>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p>
</div>
<p>Hamasaki's lyrics, all her own, have resonated among her fans, who praise them as being honest and heartfelt and "expressing determination"; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki's lyrics as their favorite aspect of her artistry. Steve McClure of <i>The Japan Times</i> noted that Hamasaki has "developed a reputation as a thoughtful, introspective lyricist"; Barry Walters of <i>The Village Voice</i> comments that Hamasaki's lyrics "pack unlikely insights". Having "trouble voicing her thoughts", Hamasaki uses her lyrics as an outlet; she draws inspiration from her own (and occasionally her friends') experiences and emotions and tries to put them "honestly into words". She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, "If I write when I'm low, it will be a dark song, but I don't care. I want to be honest with myself at all times." This meant that she did not use English lyrics until her album <i>Rainbow</i>, as she felt that she could best express herself in Japanese. As with her musical style, the themes of her lyrics have varied. Her debut album <i>A Song for Ã—Ã—</i> dealt mostly with themes of "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album <i>Loveppears</i>. <i>Duty</i> likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums <i>I Am...</i> and <i>Rainbow</i>, branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace. Music critic Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in her lyrics style between her debut album <i>A Song for Ã—Ã—</i> (1999), which mostly dealt with personal problems, and her following albums <i>Loveppears</i> and <i>Duty</i>. Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun thinking about her influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using first person pronouns as much, and instead using the words <i>bokura</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">åƒ•ã‚‰</span>, "we")</span> and <i>tsutaeru</i><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span lang="ja">ä¼ãˆã‚‹</span>, "convey")</span> more often. As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women. With <i>Guilty</i>, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in <i>Next Level</i> as well. In songs such as "Talkin' 2 Myself" and "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" to encourage listeners; in "Rollin'" (from <i>Next Level</i>), Hamasaki writes, "The age is rolling around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other". In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for "Free &amp; Easy", while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for "M"; the September 11 attacks inspired "A Song Is Born".

<p>In addition to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has also involved herself in other aspects of production such as artistic direction. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I think really we should say 'Produced by [A]yumi [H]amasaki'." Until her single "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for "M" that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. <i>I Am...</i> is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after <i>I Am...</i>: whereas nearly all of <i>I Am...</i> was her work, only nine of <i>Rainbow'</i>s fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved in the composition of subsequent albums, composing two tracks on <i>Memorial Address</i>, three on <i>My Story</i>, and one on <i>(Miss)understood</i>; since <i>Secret</i>, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself. Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above &amp; Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France, and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra. Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R&amp;B, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.

<p>Hamasaki is often involved in the artistic direction of her music videos. They are often artistic productions through which Hamasaki tries to convey the meaning or feeling of their respective songs. The themes of the videos are varied; she has made "sad and fragile" or "emotional" videos ("Momentum", "Endless Sorrow"), "refreshing" summer videos ("Blue Bird", "Fairyland"), surreal or "scary" videos ("1 Love", "Marionette"), and humorous videos ("Evolution", "Angel's Song", "Beautiful Fighters"). Additionally, many of the videos contain short storylines, some of which use symbolism to convey their respective messages. The video of "Voyage" depicts Hamasaki as a woman in a mental hospital whose previous incarnation was a woman in feudal Japan who was sacrificed to the moon; the video of "Endless Sorrow" features a young boy living in a society where speaking is forbidden by law. In the video for "Free &amp; Easy", Hamasaki portrayed a "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" to convey her message "freedom cannot be easily obtained; there is a price to pay for it" and to express her opposition to her marrying at the time; the video for "Ourselves" featured masked people destroying "effigies of [Hamasaki's] past" such as photographs and album covers to symbolize destruction and rebirth. Additionally, the videos of "Fairyland", "My Name's Women", "Jewel", "Green", and "Virgin Road" are among the top twenty or so most expensive music videos, making Hamasaki the only non-American artist to hold such a distinction. Hamasaki is also involved in the production and artistic direction of her live performances; they, like her videos, are often lavish productions and use a variety of props, extravagant costumes, and choreographed dances. She has used large video screens, fireworks, simulated rain drops, trick stage floors, and suspended devices.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_image">Public image</span></h3>
<p>Hamasaki's influence goes beyond music; she is often considered a fashion icon and trend-setter, a status attributed to her tight control over her image. Besides her frequent appearances in fashion magazines, such as <i>Vivi</i>, <i>Popteen</i>, and <i>Cawaii!</i>, Hamasaki has often been lauded for her trendy choices in apparels and accessories; Oricon has repeatedly named her the "Most Fashionable Female Artist". Many aspects of Japan's fashionsâ€”including clothing, hair, nails, and accessoriesâ€”have in some way been influenced by her. As with her music, trends Hamasaki started have spread to Asian countries as Taiwan, China, and Singapore. Among the trends Hamasaki has started is <i>hime-kei</i> (a look inspired by the fashions of 18th century French aristocracy); she has also heavily influenced the <i>kogal</i> subculture. Hamasaki's constantly changing image is apparent not only in her fashion photo shoots and commercial endorsements but also in her record covers, an element she considers essential in conveying her message. She has portrayed herself as a vine-clad "peace muse" or "Greek goddess" (on her album <i>I Am...</i>), as a "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" (for her single "Free &amp; Easy"), and as a "funky Lolita". Though Hamasaki has portrayed herself in earlier releases as a "girl next door", she has adopted a more sexualized image since the release of <i>Loveppears</i>. The covers for records including <i>Loveppears</i>, <i>I Am...</i>, <i>Rainbow</i>, and <i>Party Queen</i> feature Hamasaki in states of partial nudity, for which she has generated controversy. Hamasaki also garnered criticism after she modeled bra for lingerie manufacturer Wacoal, though most of the criticism alleged that Hamasaki was only trying to "play catch-up" with Kumi Koda, who gained popularity for her overtly sexual image.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>Hamasaki has accepted offers by numerous brands to endorse their products. Throughout her career under Avex, she has promoted products that ranged from electronics (Tu-Ka cell phones and Panasonic) to various snack foods. Among the products she has advertised on television are the Honda Crea scooter, KOSÃ‰ cosmetics, Mister Donut donuts, and Boss coffee. As well as serving as background music for television advertisements, some of Hamasaki's songs have been used as themes for video games, television shows and motion pictures, such as <i>Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams</i>, <i>InuYasha</i>, <i>Shinobi: Heart Under Blade</i> and <i>Tales of Xillia</i>. Although Hamasaki initially supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, saying that it was "necessary that [she is] viewed as a product", she eventually opposed Avex's decision to market her as a "product rather than a person".

<p>In 2002, Hamasaki created Ayupan, a cartoon version of herself that appeared in a line of merchandise (mainly figurines) and in a 2003 cartoon. For her 2007 tour <i>Tour of Secret</i>, Hamasaki collaborated with Sanrio to create a line of merchandise, "Ayumi Hamasaki x Hello Kitty/", that features Ayupan and Hello Kitty together. The merchandise included cell phone straps and Lumix cameras decorated with a picture of Hello Kitty behind Hamasaki's "A" logo; the former product was a result of a collaboration with Sanrio and Japanese fashion brand Ash &amp; Diamonds, the latter a collaboration with Sanrio and Panasonic.

<p>From October 2002 to March 2004 she was also the host of her own talk and variety TV show, <i>Ayuready?</i>, on Fuji Television. The talk show, aired on Saturday nights from 11:30 to midnight, often featured her performing songs with guests, among whom were Goto Maki, Puffy, and Akina Nakamori. To promote the program (and her album <i>Rainbow</i>), Hamasaki opened a restaurant, Rainbow House, on ShÅnan Beach on July 1, 2003, which was open through August 31, 2003. After less than two years, the last episode of <i>Ayuready?</i> aired in March 2004.

<p>On January 1, 2011, Hamasaki announced her engagement to Austrian actor and model Manuel Schwarz, whom Hamasaki met in August 2010 on the set of her music video for "Virgin Road". On January 2, her office announced that she and Schwarz had married in the United States the day before. However, on January 16, 2012, Hamasaki announced on her website that she would divorce Schwarz. The reason for the divorce was that, initially, Hamasaki wanted to move in with Schwarz in the United States but due to the earthquake and tsunami that hit her home country in March, 2011, she strongly desired not to leave Japan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>On December 13, 2013, it was announced on her official TeamAyu site that Hamasaki had become engaged to an American medical student 10 years her junior, whom she had been with since the spring of that year, adding: "As my partner is an ordinary student, I would be very happy if you could watch over us quietly."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>On March 3, 2014, the singer announced on her fan club site "Team Ayu" that she was officially married. According to her agency, the couple already finished their marriage procedure in the United States near the end of February. On the 3rd, Hamasaki's mother, as a deputy, submitted the marriage registration to Japan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>On September 11, 2016, Hamasaki announced that she and her husband had separated. On September 30, 2016, she announced that her divorce had been finalized; however, a motion for dissolution of the marriage was not filed until April 2017, in Los Angeles, California. As of September 2017, their marital status remains legally unresolved.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hearing_loss">Hearing loss</span></h3>
<p>In January 2008, Hamasaki announced on her blog that an inoperable condition, possibly tinnitus or MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, had caused complete deafness in her left ear. She had been diagnosed with the condition in 2006 and that the problem dated to 2000, when she developed an ear infection but continued to perform against the advice of doctors. Despite the setback, Hamasaki stated that she wished to continue singing, and that "as a professional", she wanted to "deliver the best performance for everyone". On May 20, 2017, she wrote that she is also losing hearing in her right ear, and had experienced dizziness and nausea. She vowed to continue performing, writing: "The stage is where I belong. It's the only place I really, truly exist. I don't know anything else."
