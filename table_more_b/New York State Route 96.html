<p><b>New York State RouteÂ 96</b> (<b>NYÂ 96</b>) is a 126.01-mile (202.79Â km) northwestâ€“southeast state highway in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with NYÂ 17 (Future I-86) in the Southern Tier village of Owego, Tioga County. Its northern terminus is at a junction with East Main Street in the city of Rochester, Monroe County. Between the two endpoints, NYÂ 96 passes through the city of Ithaca and the villages of Waterloo, Victor, and Pittsford. NYÂ 96 is signed northâ€“south for its entire length, although most of the route in Ontario County travels in an eastâ€“west direction.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>All of NYÂ 96, except from Candor to Ithaca and from northwest of Victor to Pittsford, was originally designated as part of <b>New York State RouteÂ 15</b> in 1924. NYÂ 15 was originally routed on modern NYÂ 96B between Candor and Ithaca, and modern NYÂ 64 and NYÂ 251 between Victor and Pittsford. It was realigned onto the modern alignment of NYÂ 96 between Victor and Pittsford in 1930. NYÂ 15 was renumbered to <b>New York State RouteÂ 2</b> c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;">â€‰1939</span> to eliminate duplication with U.S. RouteÂ 15 (USÂ 15). NYÂ 2 was subsequently redesignated as NYÂ 96 in 1942 as the alignments of NYÂ 2 and NYÂ 96, a route in Rensselaer County, were swapped. NYÂ 96 was realigned again in the early 1950s, this time between Candor and Ithaca, to serve the village of Spencer west of Candor. Near Rochester, NYÂ 96 followed what is now InterstateÂ 490 (I-490) for a short time during the 1950s and early 1960s.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Route_description">Route description</span></h2>
<p>Most of NYÂ 96's 126 miles (203Â km) are maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, three sections of the route in Tompkins County and Monroe County are maintained by local highway departments. In the Tompkins County city of Ithaca, NYÂ 96 is city-maintained from the southern city line to the start of the Fulton/Meadow Street one-way couplet, at which point maintenance of the highway reverts to NYSDOT. The route is also maintained by Ithaca from Park Road to the western city limits. The last locally owned section is in the Monroe County city of Rochester, where the entirety of NYÂ 96 within the city is city-maintained.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tioga_County">Tioga County</span></h3>
<p>Though unsigned at this point, NYÂ 96 begins at the eastbound onramp to NYÂ 17 at exitÂ 64 on Southside Drive across the Susquehanna River from the Tioga County village of Owego. The route remains unsigned until the intersection of Court Street and Southside Drive, the western terminus of NYÂ 434. NYÂ 434 continues east along Southside Drive while NYÂ 96, now fully signed, turns north onto Court Street and crosses the Susquehanna River. On the opposite side of the river, NYÂ 96 intersects Front Street. The configuration of NYÂ 96 between Front Street and East Main Street is unorthodox in that NYÂ 96 splits at Front Street to follow a one-way couplet around the Tioga County Courthouse to Main Street, where both streets terminate. NYÂ 96 turns onto Main Street for half a block to North Avenue, where it resumes its northward path. The route shares the parallel one-way streets with NYÂ 17C, which enters Owego from the west via Main Street and leaves via Front Street to the east.

<p>Now on North Avenue, NYÂ 96 passes through the heart of Owego before leaving the village and following Owego Creek into a long stretch of rural country. Just over 1 mile (1.6Â km) north of Owego village in the town of Owego, NYÂ 96 meets the southern terminus of NYÂ 38. At this point, NYÂ 38 becomes the creekside highway while NYÂ 96 passes over Owego Creek and follows Catatonk Creek northwest into the town of Candor. Once in Candor, the route and the creek turn northward toward the village of Candor, where NYÂ 96 meets NYÂ 96B, an alternate route of NYÂ 96 between Candor and the city of Ithaca. Past NYÂ 96B, NYÂ 96 turns to the west and crosses over Catatonk Creek as it exits the village. West of Candor, NYÂ 96 follows an eastâ€“west alignment through a creek valley to the village of Spencer, where the route converges with NYÂ 34 and heads north into another valley leading to Tompkins County.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tompkins_County">Tompkins County</span></h3>
<p>The two routes remain concurrent as they snake to the northwest through Tompkins County. Southwest of the city of Ithaca in the town of Ithaca, NYÂ 34 and NYÂ 96 meet NYÂ 13. The three routes continue northeast through the town, intersecting NYÂ 327 and NYÂ 13A before crossing over the inlet of Cayuga Lake and entering the city of Ithaca on Meadow Street. Here, NYÂ 96B reconnects to its parent at the junction of Clinton and Meadow Streets. North of this point, Meadow Street splits into a one-way couplet, with Fulton Street carrying southbound traffic and Meadow Street handling northbound traffic. NYÂ 79, also routed on a one-way couplet here, crosses NYÂ 96 at Green and Seneca Streets, with NYÂ 79 eastbound using one block of Fulton Street to travel from State Street to Green Street.

<p>One block north of NYÂ 79, NYÂ 96 splits from NYÂ 13 and NYÂ 34 and heads to the west at Buffalo Street. NYÂ 89 begins here, and NYÂ 96 overlaps with NYÂ 89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NYÂ 13 and NYÂ 34, NYÂ 89 and NYÂ 96 run parallel to and a few feet to the north of NYÂ 79. NYÂ 89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NYÂ 96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NYÂ 79. They do not intersect in this areaâ€”known locally as The Octopusâ€”though they once did. At one time, NYÂ 96, NYÂ 79, NYÂ 89, NYÂ 13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NYÂ 13A and NYÂ 79 intersect there while the stub of former NYÂ 89 is now a park access road that intersects with NYÂ 96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Unlike NYÂ 89, which runs along the base of the valley and parallels the west shore of Cayuga Lake, NYÂ 96 heads away from the lake, increasing the distance between itself and the water body as it proceeds northwestward to the highlands overlooking the lake. The route heads across open fields and past isolated pockets of homes toward Trumansburg, where NYÂ 96 crosses over Taughannock Creek and serves Taughannock Falls State Park southeast of the village. In Trumansburg itself, the highway becomes Main Street and meets the northern terminus of NYÂ 227 in the center of the community. NYÂ 96 continues on, exiting Trumansburg just 250 yards (229Â m) before crossing the Seneca County line.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Seneca_County">Seneca County</span></h3>
<p>NYÂ 96 proceeds northwest through a lightly populated section of Seneca County and the town of Covert to the village of Interlaken, home to the southern terminus of NYÂ 96A, a more westerly alternate route of NYÂ 96 between Interlaken and Geneva. Outside of the village, NYÂ 96 continues on a northwesterly path for another 4.5 miles (7.2Â km) to the Ovidâ€“Romulus town line, where it turns due west for 2 miles (3.2Â km) to access the village of Ovid. The route mostly bypasses the village, with NYÂ 96A and NYÂ 414 serving as its Main Street instead. The three routes meet at a junction on the northern fringe of the community, at which point NYÂ 96A leaves NYÂ 414 and turns west to follow the town line toward Seneca Lake while NYÂ 96 joins NYÂ 414 and heads north into the town of Romulus.

<p>Midway between the village of Ovid and the hamlet of Romulus, the two routes split, allowing NYÂ 414 to continue due north to Seneca Falls. NYÂ 96, meanwhile, turns to the northwest, following the eastern edge of the Seneca Army Depot for most of the distance to Romulus hamlet. Just south of the community's center, NYÂ 96 separates from the depot grounds and continues north through the hamlet and into the town of Varick. The route uneventfully crosses the town, passing by open fields on a predominantly northward alignment on its way to the Fayette town line and a junction with NYÂ 336, an eastâ€“west connector between NYÂ 96A and NYÂ 414. NYÂ 96 continues across rural terrain to the outskirts of the village of Waterloo, where the number of homes rises as the route enters the village on Fayette Street.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In the southern half of the village, the highway follows a zig-zag routing as it leaves Fayette Street at River Road before returning to the north at Washington Street one block to the east. While on Washington Street, the route passes over the Cayugaâ€“Seneca Canal and enters the village's center, changing names to Virginia Street in the process. Not far to the north, NYÂ 96 heads into Waterloo's central business district, built up around the junction of Virginia and Main (USÂ 20 and NYÂ 5) Streets. Past RoutesÂ 5 andÂ 20, NYÂ 96 continues north as a residential street to the village line, where the route turns to the west with a slight trend to the north. At this point, the scenery surrounding NYÂ 96 shifts from house-lined streets to rural countryside once again, an appearance that follows the road to the northwest through the town of Waterloo and across the county line.

<p>Although NYÂ 96 travels mostly in an eastâ€“west direction throughout Ontario County, it is still signed as a northâ€“south highway. Less than 1 mile (1.6Â km) into the county, NYÂ 96 connects to NYÂ 14 by way of a cloverleaf interchange, an oddity considering the rural location of the interchange. West of NYÂ 14, NYÂ 96 begins to parallel the paths of both the New York State Thruway (I-90) and the Canandaigua Lake outlet to the north. The highway follows both entities across the town of Phelps to the village of the same name, where NYÂ 96 meets the southern terminus of NYÂ 88. Just west of the village, NYÂ 96 intersects the northern terminus of NYÂ 488, formerly part of NYÂ 88. West of the intersection, a northward reverse S-curve draws NYÂ 96 closer to the Thruway and the outlet as the route heads toward the village of Clifton Springs, which NYÂ 96 bypasses to the north.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>4 miles (6Â km) to the west in the village of Manchester, NYÂ 96 crosses over the outlet (which roughly follows NYÂ 21 south to Canandaigua Lake from this point out) and indirectly connects to the Thruway by way of a junction with NYÂ 21 located north of the village center and just south of where NYÂ 21 meets the Thruway at exitÂ 43. West of NYÂ 21, NYÂ 96 curves gently to the south, crossing the Ontario Central Railroad before resuming its westward alignment near the grade crossing. At this point, NYÂ 96 enters the town of Farmington and begins to parallel the Thruway once more. The route passes by Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track, located between County RouteÂ 8 (CRÂ 8) and NYÂ 332, prior to intersecting NYÂ 332 itself 0.5 miles (0.8Â km) west of the race track.

<p>From this point northwestward to Rochester, NYÂ 96 passes through substantially more developed areas. The first of these is the nearby village of Victor, which NYÂ 96 enters by way of an overpass carrying it over the Ontario Central Railroad. In the village itself, the route meets the northern terminus of NYÂ 444, which travels northâ€“south between Victor and Bloomfield. West of the village in the town of Victor, NYÂ 96 runs along the base of a valley separating it from the Thruway, where it intersects the eastern terminus of NYÂ 251. The route continues on a northwesterly track for another mile (1.6Â km) before curving to the north and widening from two to four lanes as it passes under the Thruway near exitÂ 45. I-490, which begins at Thruway exitÂ 45, is accessible from NYÂ 96 by way of exitÂ 29, the eastern-most exit on I-490.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The section of NYÂ 96 between exitÂ 29 and NYÂ 250 in Perinton serves as a major commercial strip, anchored by the presence of Eastview Mall, one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along this stretch of NYÂ 96 are a series of plazas, beginning with one just north of I-490 featuring a Walmart and a Kohl's. Continuing northward, NYÂ 96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a Kmart. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes the mall, and crosses into Monroe County at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by high-voltage power lines and a large ditch.

<p>Roughly a quarter of a mile (0.4Â km) from the county line, the commercial surroundings end as NYÂ 96 intersects the southern terminus of NYÂ 250 in the town of Perinton. 0.75 miles (1.21Â km) to the northwest, NYÂ 96 meets I-490 once again, this time at exitÂ 28. West of the exit, NYÂ 96 parallels I-490 for roughly 1.25 miles (2.01Â km), serving several office parks and Powder Mills Park before reconnecting to the freeway at exitÂ 27, located on the southern edge of Bushnell's Basin, a small hamlet located directly on NYÂ 96. North of the exit, NYÂ 96 breaks from I-490 and parallels the Erie Canal through slightly less developed areas between Bushnell's Basin and Mitchell Road in the town of Pittsford, where it narrows to two lanes and becomes East Jefferson Road.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>West of Mitchell Road, NYÂ 96 takes a more southerly alignment than the canal as it enters the densely populated village of Pittsford and meets the northern and eastern termini of NYÂ 64 and NYÂ 252, respectively, at the intersection of Jefferson Road and South Main Street. NYÂ 64 heads to the south along South Main Street and NYÂ 252 continues along Jefferson Road to the west while NYÂ 96 turns north, proceeding into the heart of the village along South Main Street. In the village center, NYÂ 96 intersects Monroe Avenue and State Street, which carry NYÂ 31 eastâ€“west through Pittsford. The route continues on, becoming North Main Street as it crosses the Erie Canal and passes under the CSX Transportation-owned West Shore Subdivision. Just north of the railroad overpass is a junction with the southern terminus of NYÂ 153, the most direct route between Pittsford and nearby East Rochester.

<p>Past NYÂ 153, NYÂ 96 exits the village of Pittsford and becomes East Avenue, a name the route retains to its terminus in downtown Rochester. It proceeds northward through the heavily residential town, passing by Nazareth College and meeting the western terminus of NYÂ 31F (Fairport Road) at a junction adjacent to the campus of St. John Fisher College. East Avenue, and likewise NYÂ 96, takes on the northwesterly, four-lane alignment set by Fairport Road and begins to parallel the routing of I-490 once more as both enter the town of Brighton. Not far to the northwest of the town line, NYÂ 96 meets Elmwood and Linden Avenues, the latter carrying NYÂ 441. About 1 mile (1.6Â km) to the northwest, NYÂ 96 intersects Penfield Road, the pre-expressway alignment of NYÂ 441. One block from this point is Clover Street, which carries NYÂ 65 south of East Avenue.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>At the Brighton townâ€“Rochester city line, NYÂ 96 passes through the center of the Can of Worms, a complex interchange that links I-490 to I-590. Here, I-590 passes under NYÂ 96 while I-490 flies over NYÂ 96. On the other side of the interchange in Rochester, East Avenue becomes a commercial strip once again, but to a lesser extent than in Victor. At North Winton Road, NYÂ 96 is signed for the last time by way of a "NorthÂ 96" reassurance assembly directing traffic to stay on East Avenue. Despite this fact, the route officially continues northwestward toward downtown Rochester.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>West of Winton, NYÂ 96 passes through the East Avenue Historic District, a primarily residential area with historic upper-class houses, including the George Eastman House. This stretch of the route was narrowed in mid-2010 from four lanes to two, to improve the residential feel and reduce automobile speeds. At Alexander Street, the environment turns more commercial as the route enters the downtown area. After crossing the Inner Loop, the route passes the Little Theatre before terminating at a Y-junction with East Main Street.

<p>In 1908, the New York State Legislature created RouteÂ 36, an unsigned legislative route that extended from Owego to Seneca Falls via Candor, Ithaca, and Ovid. South of Romulus, RouteÂ 36 utilized what is now NYÂ 96 and NYÂ 96B. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owegoâ€“Interlaken and Ovidâ€“Romulus portions of legislative RouteÂ 36 became part of NYÂ 15, which began in Owego and proceeded northwest from Romulus to Rochester by way of Waterloo, Phelps, Victor, Mendon, and Pittsford. From Mendon to Rochester, NYÂ 15 followed the path of legislative RouteÂ 14, another highway dating back to 1908 that continued south from Mendon on what is now NYÂ 64 and used Monroe Avenue between Pittsford and Rochester. Another section of NYÂ 15â€”from the village of Phelps east to NYÂ 14â€”utilized what had been designated as part of legislative RouteÂ 6-a from 1911 to 1921.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>By 1926, NYÂ 31 was assigned across western and central New York, utilizing Monroe Avenue from downtown Rochester to Pittsford. Although NYÂ 96's modern routing via East Avenue was state-maintained and formerly part of legislative RouteÂ 20 from current NYÂ 31F westward, NYÂ 15 initially remained on Monroe Avenue, creating an overlap between NYÂ 15 and NYÂ 31. It was realigned at some point between 1927 and 1932 to follow East Avenue to Rochester instead. In southern Seneca County, NYÂ 15 initially passed through Lodi on its way from Interlaken to Ovid. It was realigned in the late 1920s to bypass Lodi to the northeast on the former alignment of legislative RouteÂ 36.

Prior to 1930, NYÂ 15 entered this intersection from the east (right) and left to the north (straight).</div></div></div>
<p>In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NYÂ 15 basically remained intact. The only change made at this time was the straightening out of the Victorâ€“Pittsford segment, which now bypassed Mendon in favor of a more direct alignment between the two villages via Bushnell's Basin. The former alignment of NYÂ 15 became part of NYÂ 251 east of Mendon and part of NYÂ 64 north of the hamlet. USÂ 15 was extended into New York c.<span style="white-space:nowrap;">â€‰1939</span>; it replaced NYÂ 2, which had extended from the Pennsylvania state line to Rochester. NYÂ 15 was renumbered to NYÂ 2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the U.S. Highway.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The NYÂ 96 designation was originally assigned to present-day NYÂ 2 from NYÂ 7 in Troy to RouteÂ 2 at the Massachusetts state line. In 1942, the alignments of NYÂ 2 and NYÂ 96 were swapped, placing NYÂ 96 on the Owegoâ€“Rochester routing. The only major change to NYÂ 96 since that time came in the early 1950s, when the route was realigned between Candor and Ithaca to follow a new routing via Spencer. The Candorâ€“Spencer portion of the alignment had been part of NYÂ 53 during the 1920s and part of NYÂ 223 since 1930. NYÂ 223 was truncated to its current eastern terminus at NYÂ 224 near Van Etten as part of NYÂ 96's realignment. Between Spencer and Ithaca, NYÂ 96 overlapped with NYÂ 34, which had occupied that segment of highway since the 1930 renumbering.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In the 1950s, NYÂ 96 was temporarily moved onto the Eastern Expressway as sections of the freeway opened to traffic. The first section extended from Bushnell's Basin to NYÂ 31F and opened to traffic in tNovemberÂ 1955, at which time NYÂ 96 was routed onto the new highway and NYÂ 252 and NYÂ 64 were extended eastward and northward, respectively, to cover NYÂ 96's old surface alignment. NYÂ 31F, meanwhile, was truncated to begin at the expressway. A northwest extension to what is now the Can of Worms was completed c.<span style="white-space:nowrap;">â€‰1957</span> as a realignment of NYÂ 96, resulting in the re-extension of NYÂ 31F to its original terminus and an extension of NYÂ 64 along East Avenue to the eastern edge of Rochester. NYÂ 64, NYÂ 96, and NYÂ 252 were restored to their pre-1950s alignments c.<span style="white-space:nowrap;">â€‰1961</span> when the freeway was designated as I-490.
