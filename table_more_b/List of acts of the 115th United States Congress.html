<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Acts include public and private laws, which are enacted after being passed by Congress and signed by the President; however, if the President vetoes a bill it can still be enacted by a two-thirds vote in both houses. The Senate alone considers treaties, which are ratified by a two-thirds vote.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The first public law enacted in the 115th Congress (Pub.L. 115–1) was the last law signed by President Barack Obama, and he signed it into law in the Capitol in the last hour of his presidency on January 20, 2017, shortly before the inauguration of his successor. All subsequent acts of this Congress signed into law (beginning with Pub.L. 115–2 which was signed later the same day) were signed by President Donald Trump. the 115th Congress enacted 442 statutes and ratified 6 treaties.
