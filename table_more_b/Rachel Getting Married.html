<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Kym Buchman is released from drug rehab for a few days so she can go home to attend the wedding of her older sister, Rachel. Kym's past drug- and alcohol-fueled antics have more or less made her the black sheep of her family. Kym's father, Paul, shows intense concern for her well-being and whereabouts, which Kym interprets as mistrust. Kym also resents her sister's choice of her best friend to be her maid of honor instead of her. Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's drug addiction is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the rehearsal dinner, where Kym, amid toasts from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her twelve-step program.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred years previously, which Kym retells at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her younger brother, Ethan, who was left in her care one day; driving home from a nearby park, an intoxicated Kym had lost control of the car, driving over a bridge and into a lake, where her brother drowned. The day before the wedding, as Rachel, Kym, and the other bridesmaids are getting their hair done, Kym is approached by a man whom she knew from an earlier stint in rehab. He thanks her for the strength she gave him through a story about having been molested by an uncle and having cared for her sister, who was anorexic. Rachel, hearing this, storms out of the hair salon. The story turns out to be a lie, an apparent attempt by Kym to evade responsibility for her addiction.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The tension between the sisters comes to a head that night at Paul's house, when Kym comes home. Rachel reveals she has never forgiven Kym for their brother's death and suggests Kym's rehab has been a hoax since she has been lying about the cause of her problems. Kym acknowledges the amount of progress she makes may never make her worthy of forgiveness. She gets into her father's car and leaves, heading to the home of their mother, Abby, hoping to find solace with her. However, a fight breaks out there when Kym eventually asks Abby why she left Ethan in her care the day he died despite knowing she was a drug addict. She makes it clear that she believes Abby is partly responsible for what happened and that his death could've been avoided if she kept him in Rachel's care. Abby claimed Kym was good to him and that she thinks Rachel is a spoiled hypocrite. When Kym makes her accusations clear again that Ethan's death was her mother's fault, Abby becomes furious at this and punches Kym in the face. Kym hits her back and drives off. Heavily distraught over Abby's denial over her part in her brother's death, she drives the car off the road in an attempted suicide and crashes into a boulder. She survives and spends the night sleeping in the crashed car. The next morning, the day of the wedding, the police awaken Kym, and she is given a field sobriety test, which she passes. She gets a ride home with the driver of the tow truck that is towing the wrecked car. She makes her way to Rachel's room as Rachel prepares for the wedding.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Seeing Kym's bruised face prompts her previous anger to vanish, and Rachel tenderly bathes and dresses her sister. Amid a festive Indian theme, Rachel and her fiancÃ©, Sidney, are wed. Kym is the maid of honor and overcome with emotion as the couple exchanges their vows. She tries to enjoy herself throughout the wedding reception but continues to feel out of place and is plagued by the dispute with Abby, who is also there. Ultimately, Abby leaves the reception early despite Rachel's effort to bring the two together, and the feud between Kym and Abby is left unresolved. The next morning, Kym returns to rehab. As she is leaving, Rachel runs out of the house to hug her.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>The screenplay was written by Jenny Lumet, the daughter of director Sidney Lumet and granddaughter of Lena Horne. Lumet, a junior high school drama teacher, has written four earlier screenplays, but this was the first to be produced. The film is directed by Jonathan Demme, and was shot in Stamford, Connecticut in a naturalistic style. The working title for the film was originally <i>Dancing with Shiva</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Sidney Lumet himself approached Demme about his daughter Jenny's script. Demme has commented that he loved Jenny's flagrant disregard for the rules of formula, her lack of concern for making her characters likable in the conventional sense, and for what he considered to be her bold approach to truth, pain, and humor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Filming took 33 days and occurred in late 2007.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Casting">Casting</span></h3>
<p>Demme had wanted to work with Anne Hathaway ever since he spotted her in a crowd at a screening five years earlier. He immediately took her in consideration for the lead role. Hathaway later said of her first reading Lumet's script: "I was in my old apartment in the West Village Manhattan, just pacing back and forth between the kitchen table and the couch. I somehow wound up on the floor sobbing by the last page."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Rosemarie DeWitt was considered by the film's casting directors. Demme and the rest of the crew were impressed and immediately wanted her to play Rachel. Bill Irwin is a personal friend of Demme's.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Tunde Adebimpe's role, Sidney, was originally offered to American film director Paul Thomas Anderson while he was working on the post-production of the movie <i>There Will Be Blood</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Demme was concerned about Debra Winger's interest in doing the film, but he pumped up his courage to ask her because they had met several times before at the Jacob Burns Center, a film center close to their homes. Winger later accepted the role of Abby.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h3>
<p>The music-loving director Demme invited musicians to compose the score live on set, to support the film's storyline.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>"For the longest time," Demme has said, "I've had this desire to provide the musical dimension of a movie without traditionally scored music. I thought: wait a minute; in the script, Paul [father of the bride] is a music-industry bigwig, Sidney's a record producer, many of his friends will be gifted musicians, so of course there would be non-stop music at this gathering. We have music playing live throughout the weekend, but always in the next room, out on the porch or in the garden."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Throughout the unconventional filming and loosely staged scenes, a New Yorkâ€“based Middle Eastern ensemble, including Palestinian musician Zafer Tawil, and Iraqi Amir ElSaffar, who played the score of Demme's documentary <i>Man from Plains</i>, compose the score on set. Always present at the filming, the musicians had the freedom â€“ and were encouraged â€“ to play whenever they were inspired to, and to ignore the camera.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>According to Demme on the DVD, during filming of a dramatic scene, Hathaway complained about the music interfering with the mood, to which Demme responded "Tell her to do something about it!" Hathaway, in that scene, responded by improvising the line, "Can you tell them to knock it off?!" to which another actor not heavily involved in the scene went off-screen and told the band to stop.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Well-known acting faces mingle anonymously on-screen with musicians, artists, and dancers. Among them are the New Orleanian saxophonist Donald Harrison Jr., and the Brooklyn-based TV on the Radio's lead singer Tunde Adebimpe.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Singer-songwriter Robyn Hitchcock plays a wedding guest. At the ceremony Hitchcock, at the request of his old friend Demme, performs the song "America" from his 1982 album <i>Groovy Decay</i>. He also plays "Up To Our Nex", written for the movie. "It's my micro-encapsulation of the movie. The song is trying to be a voice in Kym's head." Filmed in one take at the wedding party, he is spontaneously joined by the hip-hop star Fab 5 Freddy, and the dancehall singers Sister Carol, ElSaffar and Tawil.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Hitchcock recalled,

<td style="vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;">My memory of the whole thing is of being at a real wedding, although without the alcohol. A lot was shot in real time and the end result was the whole thing seemed as if it really had happened. It's as real as it gets. By the time I did 'Up To Our Nex' in the tent I had 15 people. Amir did a horn arrangement and Demme's son Brooklyn Demme was on electric guitar. We hadn't all played together before. The line between reality and fiction â€“ it was a door you could walk in and out of as much as you liked. The idea that they are just playing live, that's the beauty of it. The thing I really liked about the music in the movie is that it all happens in real time. The moments of real tension in the film are not signposted by the score. It's not telling you how you're going to react when the music comes. The music is very organic, not manipulative.

<p>For Demme, it was about creating evocative music in the moment.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_response">Critical response</span></h3>
<p>The film received critical acclaim and appeared on many "Best Film of 2008" lists. Michael Phillips of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> called the film "a triumph of ambience," and that Hathaway, DeWitt, Irwin and especially Winger are working at a very high level. Roger Ebert's four-star rating added, "apart from the story, which is interesting enough, 'Rachel Getting Married' is like the theme music for an evolving new age." Other critics praised Jonathan Demme. Andrew Sarris noted in the <i>New York Observer</i> "his career of cinematic good works" and Owen Gleiberman of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> observed "a fight scene that's as raw as Ingmar Bergman and as operatic as Mildred Pierce"... and "Demme's finest work since <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> noted that <i>Rachel Getting Married</i> is "a home run ... [it goes] deep into the joy and pain of being human." A.O. Scott of <i>The New York Times</i> said that the film "has an undeniable and authentic vitality, an exuberance of spirit, that feels welcome and rare".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Many reviewers praised the film for its organic feel; <i>Salon</i> reviewer Stephanie Zacharek noted that "with 'Rachel Getting Married,' Demme has once again scaled back, making a picture that has some of the ease and warmth of his earlier movies, although it also feels stripped down and direct in a way that's new for Demme." <i>USA Today</i> proclaimed: "After a foray in documentary films, director Jonathan Demme has returned to narrative storytelling, assuming a decidedly cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© style that has echoes of Robert Altman. The film's greatest asset is the sense of cringing realism in portraying dinner parties and interpersonal encounters that can throw family members off-kilter." The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> noted:

The director chose not to plan shots in advance, instead giving Quinn (whose credits include Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding") the ability to respond in the moment to what was going on with the actors, and it's a tribute to his ability (and that of editor Tim Squyres) that his camera always seems to be in the right place at the right time.

<p>Anne Hathaway won raves for her work as Kym. <i>USA Today</i> found her wonderful in the role and wrote "Her nervous laughter, edginess and quick temper blend convincingly with her need for attention and vulnerability." <i>Newsweek</i> commented: "Kym is a major pain in the ass, and Hathaway's raw, spiky performance makes no attempt to ingratiate. Yet she makes Kym's inner torment so palpable you can't help but feel for her, however insufferable she may be. It's a terrific performance ...". <i>Empire</i> felt that "Kym is a peach of a roleâ€”she sleeps with the best man, fights with the maid of honor, quips, 'You're so thin, it's like you're Asian'â€”and Hathaway squeezes it for all the juice it's worth, making this raw-nerved, narcissistic Tasmanian Devil not just believable, but somehow likable."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>As of JuneÂ 10, 2014, the film holds an overall 85 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes. The film received a score of 82, indicating "universal acclaim", on the critical aggregator website Metacritic.
