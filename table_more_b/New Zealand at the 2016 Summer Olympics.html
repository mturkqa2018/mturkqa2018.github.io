<p><b>New Zealand</b> competed at the <b>2016 Summer Olympics</b> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's twenty-third appearance as an independent nation at the Summer Olympics, having made its debut at the 1920 Games and competed at every Games since. The New Zealand team consisted of 199 athletes, 100 women and 99 men, across twenty sports, the first time New Zealand was represented by more women than men at the Summer Olympics.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The New Zealand team collected a total of 18 medals, four gold, nine silver and five bronze, at these Games, surpassing a record of 13 gained at both the 1988 and 2012 Summer Olympics; it also exceeded High Performance Sport New Zealand's (HPSNZ) target of 14 medals for the Games. Athletics (track and field) and sailing led the sports with four medals each, with three medals in each of canoeing and rowing, and one medal in each of cycling, golf, rugby sevens and shooting. Rowers MahÃ© Drysdale, Hamish Bond and Eric Murray, and sprint canoeist Lisa Carrington successfully defended their Olympic titles, while sailors Peter Burling and Blair Tuke ran away in the 49er class standings and secured their gold-medal victory before the final two races. New Zealand women won the majority of the medals (11), the second time this has happened in the nation's Olympic history (the first was in 1952).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Delegation">Delegation</span></h2>
<p>The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) confirmed a team of 199 athletes, 99 men and 100 women, to compete in twenty sports. It is the largest delegation New Zealand has sent to the Olympics, surpassing the 184 athletes who were sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The nation participated in four more sports than 2012: while not qualifying any competitors in boxing, New Zealand qualified competitors in golf and rugby sevens (both new to the 2016 Games), diving, gymnastics and wrestling. Also missing from the 2016 team is the men's football squad, having been disqualified after fielding an ineligible player in the Olympic qualifying tournament. Rowing had the largest delegation with 36 competitors; diving, judo, taekwondo and wrestling had the smallest delegations with only one competitor each.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>For individual sports, the NZOC's overarching selection policy meant it would only consider selecting athletes that were proven capable of making the top 16. For team sports, the NZOC would only consider selecting teams proven capable of advancing beyond the first round.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Seventeen-year-old gymnast Courtney McGregor is New Zealand's youngest competitor, while 62-year-old equestrian dressage rider Julie Brougham is the oldest competitor. Forty-one competitors (20.5 percent) are of MÄori descent, including 17 of the 24 rugby sevens players.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>A number of past Olympic medallists returned, including defending champions: Valerie Adams (women's shot put), sailors Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie (women's 470 class), flatwater canoeist Lisa Carrington (women's K-1 200m), and rowers MahÃ© Drysdale (men's single sculls), and Hamish Bond and Eric Murray (men's pair). Sailors Peter Burling and Blair Tuke, who won silver in 2012, were selected as co-captains of the New Zealand team, with Burling acting as flagbearer for the opening ceremony.

<p>New Zealand qualified one mountain biker for the men's Olympic cross-country race, as a result of his nation's seventeenth-place finish in the UCI Olympic Ranking List of 25 May 2016. One additional spot was awarded to the female mountain biker, who won the cross-country race for New Zealand at the 2015 Oceania Championships. With Olympic selection criteria requiring riders to show top eight potential, the NZOC decided to only nominate one mountain biker to the Olympic roster, who was Sam Gaze for the men's cross-country event.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Equestrian at the 2016 Summer Olympics</div>
<p>New Zealand equestrians qualified a full squad in the team eventing competition through the 2015 Asia and Pacific Eventing Championships in Boekelo, Netherlands. One dressage rider was later added to the squad by virtue of a top finish from Asia &amp; Oceania in the individual FEI Olympic rankings. New Zealand's equestrian team was named on 27 June 2016. Jock Paget withdrew on 5 August 2016 after his horse, Clifton Lush, cut its cheek at the Rio stable and did not recover in time for the event. Reserve Tim Price and his horse Ringwood Sky Boy subsequently replaced Paget in the individual and team eventing.

Only three nations qualified through this route, but South Korea had already secured qualification as continental champions and Brazil failed to meet IOC and FIH criteria to qualify as host nation, opening places up for the fourth-placed teams.

<p>New Zealand qualified ten out of a possible fourteen boats for each of the rowing classes listed below. The majority of the rowing crews confirmed Olympic places for their boats at the 2015 FISA World Championships in Lac d'Aiguebelette, France, while a women's single sculls rower had added one more boat to the New Zealand roster as a result of a top three finish at the 2016 European &amp; Final Qualification Regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland. The crews had to have also competed at the NZ Rowing Championships, held in Lake Karapiro, to assure their selection to the Olympic team for the Games.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>The rowing team was named on 4 March 2016, featuring 2012 Olympic champions MahÃ© Drysdale in men's single sculls and Hamish Bond and Eric Murray in the men's pair.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>On 1 July 2016, the Russian men's quadruple sculls boat was disqualified due to a doping violation, resulting in New Zealand gaining the men's quadruple sculls slot as the next-best non-qualifier.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>For the first time in Olympic history, New Zealand rowers participated in the men's lightweight four and the women's eight.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Sailing at the 2016 Summer Olympics</div>
<p>New Zealand qualified one boat for each of the following classes at the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships, bringing the maximum quota of 15 sailors, in ten boats. The first ten sailors competing in five double-handed classes were named on 14 March 2016, including defending Olympic champions Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie and 2012 silver medallists Peter Burling and Blair Tuke The remaining two sailors competing in the single-handed classes were named on 10 May 2016.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>On 12 March 2016, London 2012 windsurfer JP Tobin announced his decision not to compete at the Games, citing a lack of financial support from Yachting New Zealand (YNZ). On 2 June 2016, the NZ Sports Tribunal and YNZ had upheld their decision not to nominate windsurfer Natalia Kosinska and Laser Radial sailor Sara Winther on the sailing team for failing to achieve the federation's selection standards, following appeals. As a result, New Zealand did not field any windsurfers at the Olympics for the first time in 36 years.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics</div>
<p>New Zealand swimmers achieved qualifying standards in the following events (up to a maximum of 2 swimmers in each event at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST)): To assure their selection to the Olympic team, swimmers attained an Olympic qualifying cut in each of their individual events at the New Zealand Olympic Trials in Auckland (March 28 to April 1) and the Canadian Olympic Trials in Toronto (April 5 to 10).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p><p>The NZOC announced the full swimming team on 15 April 2016, including two-time Olympic breaststroker Glenn Snyders and distance freestyle ace Lauren Boyle. Open water swimmer Kane Radford earned an additional place on the NZ Olympic team, as Oceania's top-ranked representative outside the world's top ten of the men's 10Â km marathon at the World Olympic Qualifier in Setubal, Portugal, which was eventually rejected by Swimming New Zealand. On 27 June 2016, Radford was nominated to the NZOC, following his successful appeal to the NZ Sport Tribunal. Boyle, one of New Zealand medal hopes, struggled with illness during her Olympic preparations and did not advance beyond the heat.

The berth was awarded to Craig Miller, who finished third at the 2016 African &amp; Oceania Qualification Tournament in Algiers, Algeria, after Australian wrestler Vinod Kumar Dahiya was disqualified due to a doping violation.

<p>The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) sold exclusive New Zealand broadcasting rights to Sky Television. The games are being screened across 12 subscription based channels: Sky Sport 3 and 4, plus 10 "pop-up" channels. Sky is also showing highlights on its free-to-air channel, Prime.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">73</span></p><p>Sky TV's exclusive rights caused problems with New Zealand's other media outlets. Whilst copyright law allows for "fair dealing", i.e. the reporting of short extracts, Sky TV offered contracts to media outlets that would restrict reporting to well below what the law allows. Sky TV argued that the deal offered to New Zealand media was one of the most accommodating worldwide â the terms were described by Sky TV as "the most reasonable in the world," â however, other media outlets saw it differently. On 19 July, Fairfax New Zealand (owners of Wellington's <i>The Dominion Post</i> and Christchurch's <i>The Press</i> among other newspapers, as well as the Stuff.co.nz website) and New Zealand Media and Entertainment (NZME; owners of <i>The New Zealand Herald</i> and The Radio Network) announced that they would not send their staff to Rio to report the Olympics. After Fairfax and NZME refused to sign Sky TV's agreement, both companies were served legal papers on 29 July, alleging intended copyright breaches and threatening court injunctions unless they signed the agreement by the following Monday. In a Fairfax editorial published in its newspapers, the blame for the situation was partly put to the NZOC that gave away an exclusive contract but refused to step in when Sky TV offered deals below what was allowed by law.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">74</span></p><p>Sky TV filed for an injunction against Fairfax Media using its footage, saying it was undermining its copyright. Fairfax countered Sky's argument saying the use of its footage was allowed under fair dealing provisions. On 12 August 2016, the High Court dismissed Sky's injunction bid.
