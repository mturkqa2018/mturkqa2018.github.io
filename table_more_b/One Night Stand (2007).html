<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Storylines">Storylines</span></h2>
<p>The main feud heading into the event on the Raw brand, was between WWE Champion John Cena and The Great Khali. This was a rematch of their encounter at Judgment Day, the pay-per-view two weeks before One Night Stand. At the event, Cena defeated Khali by forcing him to submit to the STFU. When Khali submitted to the STFU, however, his feet were underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have broken the submission hold. Referee Mike Chioda was focusing on Khali's arm and did not see Khali's feet underneath the bottom rope. The following night on <i>Raw</i>, believing he should not have lost the match, Khali challenged Cena to a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match. After Cena's acceptance, Khali Chokeslamed Cena. Heading into One Night Stand, Khali Chokebombed Cena again to win a non-title match against Cena on the June 2 episode of <i>Saturday Night's Main Event</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand heading into the pay-per-view was between Edge and Batista, with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. The two fought each other at Judgment Day for the title, and Edge won the bout with a school boy pin. On the May 25 episode of <i>SmackDown!</i>, General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would defend the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand. Batista won a Fatal Four-Way match against Finlay, Kane, and Mark Henry to face Edge at the pay-per-view. Batista was a guest on Edge's talk show <i>The Cutting Edge</i> on the June 1 episode of <i>SmackDown!</i>. Towards the end of the segment, Batista punched Edge and sent him to the floor. The following night, on <i>Saturday Night's Main Event</i>, Batista and Chris Benoit defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a tag team match. During the match, Edge walked out, leaving MVP on his own against Batista and Benoit. Benoit gained the pinfall after performing a flying headbutt on MVP.

<p>The other primary feud featured on the One Night Stand card consisted of both Raw and ECW superstars. ECW's Bobby Lashley battled Raw's Vince McMahon for the ECW World Championship. Lashley faced Team McMahon (ECW World Champion Vince McMahon, Shane, and Umaga) in a 3-on-1 tag team Handicap match at Judgment Day, with the ECW World Championship on the line. Lashley won the match, pinning Shane after a Dominator powerslam. After the match, however, Vince declared that Lashley had not won the title and that he was still the ECW World Champion, as he had not been pinned. In the match, Lashley could have won the title, but not a member of Team McMahon. The following night, on the May 21 edition of <i>Raw</i>, Lashley was put into a Gauntlet match by Vince McMahon, with the stipulation that if he won all four of the matches in the gauntlet, he would face Vince at One Night Stand. Lashley won all four matches, defeating Chris Masters, Viscera, Umaga and Shane McMahon in succession. As a result, Lashley gained a title shot at One Night Stand in a Street Fight. On the May 28 edition of <i>Raw</i>, Lashley teamed with WWE Champion John Cena to take on Umaga, Shane McMahon and The Great Khali in a Handicap match. Shane won the match, pinning Lashley after an elbow drop. Vince was scheduled to face Lashley in an arm wrestling contest on the June 2 edition of <i>Saturday Night's Main Event</i>. Moments before the contest began, however, Vince booked Mark Henry as Lashley's opponent instead. During the contest, Vince attacked Lashley, hitting him with a steel chair.

<p>The first match that aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The next match was CM Punk and The ECW Originals (Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman) against the New Breed (Elijah Burke, Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von) in a Tables match. Towards the end, Cor Von looked to Alpha Bomb Punk through a table, but Sandman hit Cor Von with a Singapore cane. With Burke on the table, Punk suplexed Striker off the top rope and through the table and Burke to win.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The third match was The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship.  The Hardys had the advantage for most of the match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Next on the card was Mark Henry versus Kane in a Lumberjack match with twelve lumberjacks at ringside; Chris Benoit, Val Venis, Santino Marella, Balls Mahoney, Stevie Richards, The Miz, Kevin Thorn, Chris Masters, Johnny Nitro, Chavo Guerrero, Kenny Dykstra and Carlito. Kane chokeslamed Henry towards the end of the contest and attempted to pin Henry. Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered, however, and attacked Kane. Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra, but Henry locked Kane in a bear hug. The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out.

<p>The next match was Vince McMahon (accompanied by Shane McMahon and Umaga) against Bobby Lashley in a Street Fight for the ECW World Championship. Shane and Umaga interfered in the match, helping Vince gain the advantage. Shane performed a flying elbow drop, sending Lashley through the announce table at ringside.

Team McMahon kept the upper hand, as Umaga performed a Samoan Drop onto Lashley, which was followed by a spear from Vince.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aftermath">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>A storyline involving Vince McMahon's "death" began the following night on <i>Raw</i>. He appeared traumatized from losing the ECW World Championship, acting strangely as a result. This behavior continued in McMahon's appearances on all brands and culminated in a segment on the June 11 edition of <i>Raw</i> with McMahon entering a limousine moments before it exploded. On the June 25 edition of <i>Raw</i>, Vince McMahon revealed that his death was part of a storyline, and that Chris Benoit and his family were legitimately dead. The show, originally scheduled to be a three-hour special dedicated to McMahon's "death," was dedicated to Benoit and highlighted matches throughout his career.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The WWE Draft also took place on <i>Raw</i> and resulted in The Great Khali being drafted to SmackDown!, thus ending his feud with John Cena. Bobby Lashley was drafted to Raw and was forced to relinquish his ECW World Championship. Lashley, along with King Booker, Randy Orton and Mick Foley entered a feud with John Cena. On the June 18 episode of <i>Raw</i>, all men began cutting promos on how they deserved to be the number one contender to the WWE Championship.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>On the June 8 episode of <i>SmackDown!</i>, Vince McMahon announced that Edge would be defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista in a "Last Chance" match at Vengeance. On an episode of <i>SmackDown!</i>, Batista and Ric Flair defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). Midway through the match, Flair and MVP brawled outside the ring, leaving Edge on his own against Batista. Batista gained the pinfall after hitting Edge with a Batista Bomb.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>As part of the WWE Draft, Chris Benoit was drafted from SmackDown! to ECW. In his debut on the ECW brand, Benoit teamed up with CM Punk in a tag team match against Elijah Burke and Marcus Cor Von, in which Benoit and Punk won. On the June 19 episode of <i>ECW</i>, an ECW qualifying match was held in which it would determine the opponents for Vengeance for the vacant ECW title. The first qualifying match saw Benoit defeat Elijah Burke by submission and thus for advancing to the Vengeance finals. That same night, CM Punk went on to defeat Marcus Cor Von to advanced to the finals. At Vengeance, Benoit was replaced by Johnny Nitro, after he withdrew from the match for "personal reasons". At the event, Nitro defeated Punk to win the vacant ECW title.
