<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_career">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Maybin played high school baseball for T. C. Roberson High School in Asheville, North Carolina. As a freshman, he led his team to a state title and was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Joe Hayden, his manager with the Midland Redskins, said he had "the same instincts in the outfield and at the plate" as Ken Griffey Jr., who Hayden also coached in the Connie Mack Division, an amateur baseball league for players 18 and younger. The summer before his senior season, Maybin won the Connie Mack batting title and the 2004 Connie Mack World Series MVP award. Maybin was also named the 2004 <i>Baseball America</i> Youth Player of the Year.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_leagues">Minor leagues</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the 2005 MLB draft, <i>Baseball America</i> tabbed Maybin as the most promising available outfielder and the third-best hitting prospect overall. He fell to the Tigers in tenth spot in the 2005 draft in part due to speculation he would be difficult to sign. He signed in September for a $2.65Â million bonus.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In 2006, Maybin played his first professional season for the Class-A West Michigan Whitecaps, helping them win the Midwest League championship. He had a batting average of .304, hit nine home runs and stole 27 bases. He was chosen to participate in the All-Star Futures Game.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In late November 2006, Cameron was given the Class A Playoff Performer Award by MiLB.com. He began the 2007 season with the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the High-A Florida State League. On August 9, 2007, Maybin was promoted from the Single-A Lakeland Flying Tigers to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves where he played six games before his call up to the Major League.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Maybin was consistently ranked as the Tigers top minor league prospect while in the organization.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Maybin also played in the minors in 2008 for the Marlins Double-A affiliate Carolina Mudcats where he hit .277 with 13 home runs, 49 RBIs and 21 stolen bases to go along with a hefty 124 strikeouts in 390 at-bats (108 games).

<p>Maybin was called up to the Tigers on August 17, 2007, and made his Major League debut that day, going 0-for-4. He was the youngest player in the American League (20 years old). In his second game, August 18, 2007, Maybin picked up his first career hit, (a single), and first career home run, both off of Roger Clemens. During his next plate appearance, he was hit by a Clemens fastball. Thus, Maybin received his first Major League hit, home run and hit-by-pitch in the same game.

<p>On December 5, 2007, the Tigers traded Maybin, Andrew Miller, Mike Rabelo, Dallas Trahern, Eulogio De La Cruz, and Burke Badenhop to the Florida Marlins for Dontrelle Willis and Miguel Cabrera.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>On September 16, 2008, Maybin was called up to the Florida Marlins. He went 16 for 32 (.500 average) with 4 stolen bases in 8 Major League games.  On September 28, 2008, playing in center field, he caught the final out in the final game played at Shea Stadium â€“ a fly ball from New York Mets right fielder Ryan Church.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 2009, Maybin was the starting center fielder for the Florida Marlins when they faced the Washington Nationals on Opening Day.  Maybin was sent down to the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs on May 10 after a poor start to the 2009 season, hitting .202 in 22 starts.  Maybin was called back up to the Marlins on August 31 after hitting .319 in Triple-A and finished out the season with the big league club.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Maybin again began 2010 as the Marlins starting center fielder, but was sent to Triple-A New Orleans on June 17 after hitting .225 with the club. He hit .340 in the minors and rejoined the Marlins on August 24.  In his final season with the Marlins, Maybin finished the year hitting .234 with 9 stolen bases over 82 total games.

<p>Following the 2010 season, Maybin was traded to the Padres for Ryan Webb and Edward Mujica. In 2011, he became the ninth player in Padres history to steal 40Â bases. He hit .264 with nine home runs and 40Â RBIs and was the Padres' 2011 nominee for the Hank Aaron Award. The <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> praised Maybin's defense and called his acquisition "one of the best trades in Padres history" and named him the team's MVP. <i>MLB.com</i> wrote that his defense in center field was "Gold Glove-caliber".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>On March 3, 2012, Maybin and the Padres agreed on a 5-year deal worth $25Â million with a club option for a 6th year.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Maybin began the 2012 season in a prolonged slump, hitting .212 in the first half of the season, but he rebounded in the second half, batting .283, and finished the year with a .243/.306/.349 batting line and 26 stolen bases.  He removed a high leg kick from his swing in July and credited the adjustment with his improved results. Maybin was also hampered during the season by a lingering sore wrist that caused him to miss a handful of starts in late May and in July and a sore Achilles' tendon that cost him time in September. Maybin made 136 starts in center field on the year.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Maybin lost most of the 2013 season to injuries. He started 10 games in center field before going on the disabled list in mid-April with inflammation and an impingement in his right wrist.  He returned for 4 games in early June before he tore a posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee diving for a ball. While rehabbing the knee, Maybin decided to have surgery on the wrist in September as it continued to trouble him. The surgery found loose particles and loose cartilage and a recovery time of 8â€“12 weeks was expected.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>On July 23, 2014, Maybin was suspended 25 games for using amphetamines, a violation of the Major League Baseball drug policy.  He said the failed test was the result of treatment for attention deficit disorder (ADD), but added: "I understand that I must accept responsibility for this mistake". Maybin was activated from the restricted list on August 20, 2014.
