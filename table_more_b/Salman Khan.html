<p><b>Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan</b> (<small>pronouncedÂ </small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[sÉ™lËˆmaËn ËˆxaËn]</span>; born 27 December 1965) is an Indian film actor, producer, occasional singer and television personality. In a film career spanning over thirty years, Khan has received numerous awards, including two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two Filmfare Awards for acting. He has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide, and is cited in the media as one of the most commercially successful actors of both world and Indian cinema. According to the <i>Forbes</i> 2018 list of Top-Paid 100 Celebrity Entertainers in world, Khan was the highest ranked Indian with 82nd rank with earnings of $37.7 million. He is also known as the host of the reality show, <i>Bigg Boss</i> since 2010.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan, Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in <i>Biwi Ho To Aisi</i> (1988) and achieved breakthrough with a leading role in <i>Maine Pyar Kiya</i> (1989). Khan went on to establish himself in Bollywood in the 1990s with roles in several top-grossing productions, including the romantic drama <i>Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</i> (1994), the action thriller <i>Karan Arjun</i> (1995), the comedy <i>Biwi No.1</i> (1999), and the family drama <i>Hum Saath-Saath Hain</i> (1999). After a brief period of decline in the 2000s, Khan achieved greater stardom in the 2010s by playing the lead role in successful films <i>Dabangg</i> (2010), <i>Ready</i> (2011), <i>Ek Tha Tiger</i> (2012), <i>Kick</i> (2014), <i>Sultan</i> (2016) and <i>Tiger Zinda Hai</i> (2017), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. He's the only actor to star in the highest-grossing Bollywood films of ten separate years. According to the <i>Forbes</i> 2015 list of Top-Paid 100 Celebrity Entertainers in world, Khan was the highest ranked Indian with 71st rank with earnings of $33.5 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In addition to his acting career, Khan is a television presenter and promotes humanitarian causes through his charity, Being Human Foundation. Khan's off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. In 2015 he was convicted of culpable homicide for a negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car, killing one, but his conviction was set aside on appeal. On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He is currently out on bail while an appeal is being heard.

<p>On 28 September 2002, Khan was arrested for rash and negligent driving after his car ran into a bakery in Mumbai; one person who was sleeping on the pavement outside the bakery died and three others were injured in the accident. Charges of culpable homicide were laid against him, but later dropped. On 24 July 2013, he was formally charged with culpable homicide in the case, to which he pleaded not guilty.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>On 6 May 2015, Khan was found guilty of all charges in the case. The Bombay Sessions Court concluded that Khan was driving the car under the influence of alcohol, causing the death of one and serious injury to four homeless persons. Sessions judge DW Deshpande convicted the actor for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to five years in prison. Later in the same day, Khan, being represented by Senior Counsel Amit Desai was granted bail by the Bombay High Court till 8 May 2015, on which the court suspended his prison sentence until the final appeal hearing in July. His driver Ashok Singh, who had given the testimony that it was himself who was driving the car at the time of accident, was charged with perjury for misguiding the Court with false testimony and was arrested. The kidnapping and eventual death of prime witness Police Constable Ravindra Patil remains a mystery, with some suspecting the involvement of organised crime. In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case due to lack of evidence. The Supreme Court on Tuesday 5 July 2016 admitted a plea by the Maharashtra government that challenged the acquittal of Salman Khan in this hit-and-run case by the Bombay High Court. The court refused to fast-track the case.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_with_Aishwarya_Rai">Relationship with Aishwarya Rai</span></h3>
<p>His relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicized topic in the Indian media. After their breakup in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their breakup and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him. In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government's Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake.
