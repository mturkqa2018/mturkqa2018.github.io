<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>White Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1913, from portions of Oxford Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 1, 1913, making it the second-youngest township in the county.  The township was named after Alexander White, who came to the area sometime before 1760 and built a stone mansion called "The White House" near a place called Roxburg.
