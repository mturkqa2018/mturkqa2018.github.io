<p><b>American football</b>, referred to as <b>football</b> in the United States and Canada and also known as <b>gridiron</b>,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">&#91;nb 1&#93;</a></sup> is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field</a> with goalposts at each end.  The offense</a>, which is the team controlling the oval-shaped football</a>, attempts to advance down the field by running</a> with or passing</a> the ball, while the defense, which is the team without control of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and aims to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs</a>, or plays, and otherwise they turn over</a> the football to the defense; if the offense succeeds in advancing ten yards or more, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone</a> for a touchdown</a> or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal</a>. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of association football</a> (known in the U.S. as soccer) and rugby football</a>. The first match of American football was played on November 6, 1869</a>, between two college teams, Rutgers</a> and Princeton</a>, under rules based on the association football rules of the time.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> During the latter half of the 1870s, colleges playing association football switched to the Rugby Union code</a>, which allowed carrying the ball. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880</a> onward by Walter Camp</a>, the "Father of American Football", established the snap</a>, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs; later rule changes legalized the forward pass</a>, created the neutral zone</a>, and specified the size and shape of the football. The sport is closely related</a> to Canadian football</a>, which evolved parallel and contemporary to the American game, and most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>American football as a whole is the most popular sport in the United States</a>. The most popular forms of the game are professional</a> and college football</a>, with the other major levels being high school</a> and youth football. As of  2012<sup class="plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">&#91;update&#93;</a></sup>, nearly 1.1&#160;million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the sport in the United States annually, almost all of them men, with a few exceptions</a>. The National Football League</a>, the most popular American football league, has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world</a>; its championship game, the Super Bowl</a>, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world, and the league has an annual revenue of around US$10&#160;billion.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_history">Early history</span></h3>
<p>American football evolved from the sports of association football (soccer) and rugby football</a>. Rugby football, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.<sup id="cite_ref-The_basics_of_rugby_union_9-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>What is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869</a> between Rutgers</a> and Princeton</a>, two college teams. The game was played between two teams of 25 players each and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the ultimate goal being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6 goals to 4.<sup id="cite_ref-Rutgers_10-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-No_Christian_End_11-0" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Collegiate play continued for several years in which matches were played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, Columbia</a>, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873 to create a standard set of rules for all schools to adhere to. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet (122&#160;m ×&#160;76&#160;m) were specified. Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.<sup id="cite_ref-No_Christian_End_11-1" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The introduction of the snap resulted in unexpected consequences. Prior to the snap, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they now could hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, both teams in a game between Yale-Princeton used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records. Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0–0 tie. This "block game" proved extremely unpopular with the spectators and fans of both teams.<sup id="cite_ref-Camp_and_His_Followers_12-3" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum was considered. However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three downs</a>, or tackles, to advance the ball five yards. Failure to advance the ball the required distance within those three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team. This change effectively made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field to measure distances made it resemble a gridiron</a> in appearance. Other major rule changes included a reduction of the field size to 110 by 53.333 yards (100.584&#160;m ×&#160;48.768&#160;m), and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a goal following a touchdown</a>, and five for a goal from field</a>; additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized.<sup id="cite_ref-Camp_and_His_Followers_12-4" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The last, and arguably most important innovation, which would at last make American football uniquely "American", was the legalization of interference, or blocking</a>, a tactic which was highly illegal under the rugby-style rules.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The legal forward pass</a> was introduced in 1906, although its impact was initially limited due to the restrictions placed on its use.

<p>On November 12, 1892, William "Pudge" Heffelfinger</a> was paid $500 to play a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association</a> in a match against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club</a>. This is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football</a>, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits, such as helping players attain employment, giving out trophies or watches that players could pawn for money, or paying double in expense money. Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not outright prohibited.<sup id="cite_ref-birth_21-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Over time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The National Football League</a> (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team.<sup id="cite_ref-The_First_25_Years_22-0" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> By 1922, the NFL had established itself as the premier professional football league.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The dominant form of football at the time was played at the collegiate level</a>, but the upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925 when an NFL team, the Pottsville Maroons</a>, defeated a team of Notre Dame</a> all-stars in an exhibition game</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Curse_24-0" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to further distinguish itself from the college game during the late 1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-The_First_25_Years_22-1" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Football in general became increasingly popular following the 1958 NFL Championship game</a>, a match between the Baltimore Colts</a> and the New York Giants</a> that is still referred to as the "Greatest Game Ever Played". The game, a 23–17 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major impact on the popularity of the sport. This, along with the innovations introduced by the new American Football League</a> (AFL) in the early 1960s, helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.<sup id="cite_ref-Greatest_game_ever_played_25-0" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>The rival American Football League</a> arose in 1960 and challenged the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, with an initial television contract with the ABC</a> network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States: official time on the scoreboard clock, rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL. The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets</a> signed rookie Joe Namath</a> to a then-record US$437,000 contract. A five-year, $40&#160;million NBC</a> television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966, when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one</a> that would take full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. That game began play at the end of the 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues, and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the Super Bowl</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Second_25_Years_26-0" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>College football maintained a tradition of postseason bowl games</a>. Each bowl game would be associated with a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition</a>, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance</a>, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS).<sup id="cite_ref-BCS_27-0" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial</a>, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff</a> (CFP).<sup id="cite_ref-Presidents_get_playoff_plan_right_28-0" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>

The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner</a> (KR).<sup id="cite_ref-The_Role_of_Special_Teams_in_a_Football_Game_51-0" class="reference">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In American football, the winner is the team that has scored the most points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>The touchdown</a> (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered in the end zone of the opposing team.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_in_a_nutshell_41-4" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> The scoring team then attempts a try</a> or conversion</a>, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>A PAT is most commonly attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point.<sup id="cite_ref-Duke_53-0" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion</a><sup id="cite_ref-Duke_53-1" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be snapped from the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt, although under a rare set of circumstances it is possible to score a safety, worth one point, if the defense takes the ball back into its own end zone and is downed there.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_Rules_2012,_p._56-57_54-0" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NCAA_Rules_2011–2012,_pp._77-79_55-0" class="reference">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NFHS_Rules_2012,_pp._65-66_56-0" class="reference">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.<sup id="cite_ref-Duke_53-2" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>A field goal</a> (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is placekicked or dropkicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_Rules_2012,_p._57-59_57-0" class="reference">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NCAA_Rules_2011–2012,_p._79-80_58-0" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NFHS_Rules_2012,_p._66_59-0" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.<sup id="cite_ref-Beginner&#39;s_Guide_to_Football_60-0" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>

Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_in_a_nutshell_41-5" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NFL_Rules_2012,_p._60_61-0" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a whistle</a> and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white. Each carries a weighted yellow flag</a> that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul</a> has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal.<sup id="cite_ref-American_Football_Officials_107-0" class="reference">&#91;106&#93;</a></sup> The seven officials on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:<sup id="cite_ref-American_Football_Officials_107-1" class="reference">&#91;106&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p>
<ul><li>The <b>referee</b> is positioned behind and to the side of the offensive backs. The referee is charged with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and any and all rule interpretations in discussions between the other officials. The referee announces all penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team's captain, monitors for illegal hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head coach whenever a player is ejected. The referee positions themselves to the passing arm side of the quarterback. In most games, the referee is responsible for spotting the football prior to a play from scrimmage.</li>
<li>The <b>umpire</b> is positioned in the defensive backfield, except in the NFL, where the umpire is positioned lateral to the referee on the opposite side of the formation. The umpire watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield</a> on pass plays. The umpire monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding</a> penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.</li>
<li>The <b>back judge</b> is positioned deep in the defensive backfield, behind the umpire. The back judge ensures that the defensive team has no more than 11 players on the field and determines whether catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a pass interference</a> violation occurred. The back judge is also responsible for the play clock, the time between each play, when a visible play clock is not used.</li>
<li>The <b>head linesman</b> is positioned on one end of the line of scrimmage. The head linesman watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.</li></ul>

The number on the marker is changed using a dial.</div></div></div>
<ul><li>The <b>side judge</b> is positioned twenty yards downfield of the head linesman. The side judge mainly duplicates the functions of the field judge. On field goal and extra point attempts, the side judge is positioned lateral to the umpire.</li>
<li>The <b>line judge</b> is positioned on the end of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. The line judge notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half</a>. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.</li>
<li>The <b>field judge</b> is positioned twenty yards downfield from the line judge. The field judge monitors and controls the play clock</a>, counts the number of defensive players on the field, and watches for offensive pass interference and illegal use-of-hands violations by offensive players. The field judge also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries, the ball spot when a player goes out of bounds, and illegal touching of fumbled balls that have crossed the line of scrimmage. On field goal and extra point attempts, the field judge is stationed under the upright opposite the back judge.</li>
<li>The <b>center judge</b> is an eighth official used in the top level of college football. The center judge stands lateral to the referee, the same way the umpire does in the NFL. The center judge is responsible for spotting the football after each play, and has many of the same responsibilities as the referee, except announcing penalties.</li></ul>
<p>Another set of officials, the chain crew</a>, are responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Orchestration_of_the_Chain_Gang_86-1" class="reference">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rival_professional_leagues">Rival professional leagues</span></h3>
<p>Several professional football leagues have been formed as rival leagues to the NFL. The most successful rival league was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL became a significant rival in 1964</a> before signing a five-year, US$36&#160;million television deal with NBC. AFL teams began to sign NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL. The two leagues merged in the 1970 season</a>, and all AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference</a>, was in play from 1946 to 1949. After the league dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns</a> and the San Francisco 49ers</a>, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts</a> joined the league, but folded after just a year in the NFL.<sup id="cite_ref-Off-the-field_competition_yields_game-changing_merger_132-0" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>Other attempts to start rival leagues have been far less successful.
