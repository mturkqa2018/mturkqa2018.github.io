<p><b>Literature</b> refers to writing considered to have artistic merit, or "published on a particular subject: the literature on environmental epidemiology".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Its Latin root <i>literatura</i>/<i>litteratura</i> (derived itself from <i>littera</i>: <i>letter</i> or <i>handwriting</i>) was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature</a>). The concept has changed meaning over time: nowadays it can broaden to have non-written verbal art forms, and thus it is difficult to agree on its origin, which can be paired with that of language or writing itself. Developments in print technology</a> have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction</a> or non-fiction</a>, and whether it is poetry</a> or prose</a>. It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel</a>, short story</a> or drama</a>; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic</a> features or expectations (genre</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definitions">Definitions</span></h2>
<p>Definitions of literature have varied over time: it is a "culturally relative definition".<sup id="cite_ref-Leitch_&#39;&#39;et_al.&#39;&#39;,_&#39;&#39;The_Norton_Anthology_of_Theory_and_Criticivser_bad_I_don&#39;t_know_a_cboy_this_topic_go_away_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> In Western Europe</a> prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing.<sup id="cite_ref-Leitch_&#39;&#39;et_al.&#39;&#39;,_&#39;&#39;The_Norton_Anthology_of_Theory_and_Criticism&#39;&#39;,_28_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> A more restricted sense of the term emerged during the Romantic period</a>, in which it began to demarcate "imaginative" writing.<sup id="cite_ref-Ross,_The_Emergence_of_Literature:_Making_and_Reading_the_English_Canon_in_the_Eighteenth_Century,_406_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEagleton200816_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions; Cultural studies</a>, for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres, in addition to canonical works</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The value judgment</a> definition of literature considers it to cover exclusively those writings that possess high quality or distinction, forming part of the so-called <i>belles-lettres</a></i> ('fine writing') tradition.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEagleton20089_6-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> This sort of definition is that used in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> Eleventh Edition</a> (1910–11) when it classifies literature as "the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing."<sup id="cite_ref-Biswas,_&#39;&#39;Critique_of_Poetics&#39;&#39;,_538_7-0" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Problematic in this view is that there is no objective definition of what constitutes "literature": anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value judgments can change over time.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEagleton20089_6-1" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The formalist</a> definition is that "literature" foregrounds poetic effects; it is the "literariness" or "poetic" of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., journalism</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-Leitch_&#39;&#39;et_al.&#39;&#39;,_&#39;&#39;The_Norton_Anthology_of_Theory_and_Criticism&#39;&#39;,_4_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEagleton20082-6_9-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., "scientific literature</a>"), as such writing must use language according to particular standards.<sup id="cite_ref-meyer_10-0" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified; this is difficult because "ordinary language</a>" is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEagleton20084_11-0" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Etymologically</a>, the term derives from Latin</a> <i>literatura/litteratura</i> "learning, a writing, grammar," originally "writing formed with letters," from <i>litera/littera</i> "letter".<sup id="cite_ref-oetyd_12-0" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-meyer_10-1" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Genres">Genres</span></h3>
<p>Literary genre</a> is a mode of categorizing literature. The term originates from French, designating a proposed type or class.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> However, such classes are subject to change, and have been used in different ways in different periods and traditions.

<p>The history of literature follows closely the development of civilization</a>.

National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras. The epics of Homer</a>, dating from the early to middle Iron age</a>, and the great Indian epics</a> of a slightly later period, have more evidence of deliberate literary authorship, surviving like the older myths through oral tradition for long periods before being written down.

This can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to Greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments. Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but one can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I"<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold.

Many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the Sanskrit <i>Panchatantra</a></i> or the <i>Metamorphoses</a></i> of Ovid. Drama</a> and satire</a> also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. Lyric poetry</a> (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the <i>Shijing</i> or <i>Book of Songs</a></i>. Over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, historiography</a>, military science</a>, agriculture, and poetry</a>. China, the origin of modern paper making</a> and woodblock printing</a>, produced the world's first print cultures</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought</a> period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty</a> (769‒269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism</a>, of Daoism</a>, of Mohism</a>, of Legalism</a>, as well as works of military science (e.g. Sun Tzu</a>'s <i>The Art of War</a></i>) and Chinese history</a> (e.g. Sima Qian</a>'s <i>Records of the Grand Historian</a></i>). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records. An exemplary piece of narrative history</a> of ancient China was the <i>Zuo Zhuan</a></i>, which was compiled no later than 389 BCE, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BCE historian Zuo Qiuming</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In ancient India, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. Early genres included drama</a>, fables</a>, sutras</a> and epic poetry</a>. Sanskrit literature</a> begins with the Vedas</a>, dating back to 1500–1000 BCE, and continues with the Sanskrit Epics</a> of Iron Age India</a>. The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts</a>. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE, and the "circum-Vedic" texts, as well as the redaction</a> of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000‒500 BCE, resulting in a Vedic period</a>, spanning the mid-2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the Late Bronze Age</a> and the Iron Age</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Flood_23-0" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BC saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics, the <i>Mahabharata</a></i> and the <i>Ramayana</a></i>, with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD. Other major literary works are Ramcharitmanas</a> &amp; Krishnacharitmanas.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In ancient Greece, the epics of Homer</a>, who wrote the <i>Iliad</a></i> and the <i>Odyssey</a></i>, and Hesiod</a>, who wrote <i>Works and Days</a></i> and <i>Theogony</a></i>, are some of the earliest, and most influential, of Ancient Greek literature. Classical Greek genres included philosophy, poetry</a>, historiography, comedies</a> and dramas</a>. Plato</a> and Aristotle</a> authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of Western philosophy</a>, Sappho</a> and Pindar</a> were influential lyric poets</a>, and Herodotus</a> and Thucydides</a> were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of tragedies</a> written and performed during the classical age</a>, only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: Aeschylus</a>, Sophocles</a>, and Euripides</a>. The plays of Aristophanes</a> provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy</a>, the earliest form of Greek Comedy, and are in fact used to define the genre.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the Middle Ages</a> was the romance</a>, an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the novel</a>, of which early and important examples are the Chinese Monkey</a> and the German Faust</a> books.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In the Age of Reason</a> philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. The inevitable reaction was the explosion of Romanticism</a> in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th century went on, European fiction evolved towards realism</a> and naturalism</a>, the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasizing unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as Proust</a>, Eliot</a>, Joyce</a>, Kafka</a> and Pirandello</a> exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Genre fiction</a> also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical detective</a> and the alternative realities of science fiction</a>. The separation of "mainstream" and "genre" forms (including journalism) continued to blur during the period up to our own times. William Burroughs</a>, in his early works, and Hunter S. Thompson</a> expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the second World War</a>, and post-modern</a> critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychology_and_literature">Psychology and literature</span></h2>
<p>Literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person's character that would not be obvious otherwise.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHogan20111_25-0" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> It benefits the psychological development and understanding of the reader. For example, it allows a person to access emotional states from which the person has distanced himself or herself. An entry written by D. Mitchell featured in <i>The English Journal</i> explains how the author used young adult literature in order to re-experience the emotional psychology she experienced as a child which she describes as a state of "wonder".<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Hogan also explains that the temporal and emotional amount which a person devotes to understanding a character's situation in literature allows literature to be considered "ecological[ly] valid in the study of emotion".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHogan201110_27-0" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> This can be understood in the sense that literature unites a large community by provoking universal emotions. It also allows readers to access cultural aspects that they are not exposed to thus provoking new emotional experiences.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHogan201111_28-0" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Authors choose literary device according to what psychological emotion he or she is attempting to describe, thus certain literary devices are more emotionally effective than others.<sup id="cite_ref-Nezami,_S._R._A._2012_29-0" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Furthermore, literature is being more popularly regarded as a psychologically effective research tool. It can be considered a research tool because it allows psychologists to discover new psychological aspects and it also allows psychologists to promote their theories.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHogan201119_30-0" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> For example, the print capacity available for literature distribution has allowed psychological theories such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to be universally recognized.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Maslow's "Third Force Psychology Theory" even allows literary analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture and the history in which they are contextualized.

It also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing the nature because a person becomes estranged from his or her true self.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEParis198625_32-0" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, literary devices reflect a character's and an author's natural self.<sup id="cite_ref-Nezami,_S._R._A._2012_29-1" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> In his "Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature", Paris argues "D.H.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_science">Natural science</span></h3>
<p>As advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences, the "literary" nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries. Now, science appears mostly in journals</a>. Scientific works of Aristotle</a>, Copernicus</a>, and Newton</a> still exhibit great value, but since the science in them has largely become outdated, they no longer serve for scientific instruction. Yet, they remain too technical to sit well in most programs of literary study. Outside of "history of science</a>" programs, students rarely read such works.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy">Philosophy</span></h3>
<p>Philosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline. More of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences; nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in academic journals</a>. Major philosophers through history—Plato</a>, Aristotle</a>, Socrates</a>, Augustine</a>, Descartes</a>, Kierkegaard</a>, Nietzsche</a>—have become as canonical as any writers. Some recent philosophy works are argued to merit the title "literature", but much of it does not, and some areas, such as logic</a>, have become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of mathematics</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History_2">History</span></h3>
<p>A significant portion of historical writing ranks as literature, particularly the genre known as creative nonfiction</a>, as can a great deal of journalism, such as literary journalism</a>. However, these areas have become extremely large, and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose: to record data or convey immediate information. As a result, the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality, although it often(and in its better moments)has that quality. Major "literary" historians include Herodotus</a>, Thucydides</a> and Procopius</a>, all of whom count as canonical literary figures.

<p>Law</a> offers more ambiguity.

Roman civil law</a> as codified in the <i>Corpus Juris Civilis</a></i> during the reign of Justinian I</a> of the Byzantine Empire</a> has a reputation as significant literature. The founding documents of many countries, including Constitutions</a> and Law Codes</a>, can count as literature.

<p>Drama is literature intended for performance</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> The form is often combined with music and dance, as in opera</a> and musical theater</a>. A play</a> is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright</a> that is intended for performance in a theater; it comprises chiefly dialogue</a> between characters</a>, and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A closet drama</a>, by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup> Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Greek drama</a> exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge. Tragedy</a>, as a dramatic genre</a>, developed as a performance associated with religious</a> and civic festivals</a>, typically enacting or developing upon well-known historical</a> or mythological</a> themes. Tragedies generally presented very serious themes</a>. With the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. War of the Worlds (radio)</a> in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television. Conversely, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media.
