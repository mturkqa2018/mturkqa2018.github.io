<p><b>Raymond Walter Kelly</b> (born September 4, 1941) was the longest serving Commissioner in the history of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the first person to hold the post for two non-consecutive tenures. According to its website, Kelly— a lifelong New Yorker—had spent 47 years in the NYPD, serving in 25 different commands and as Police Commissioner from 1992 to 1994 and again from 2002 until 2013. Kelly was the first person to rise from Police Cadet to Police Commissioner, holding all of the department's ranks, except for Three-Star Bureau Chief, Chief of Department, and Deputy Commissioner, having been promoted directly from Two-Star Chief to First Deputy Commissioner in 1990.
After his handling of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, he was mentioned for the first time as a possible candidate for FBI Director. After Kelly turned down the position, Louis Freeh was appointed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Kelly was a Marine Corps Reserve Colonel, Director of Police under the United Nations Mission in Haiti, and an Interpol Vice President. During the Clinton administration, Kelly served as Treasury Department Under Secretary for Enforcement, as Customs Service Commissioner, and was in the running to become the first United States Ambassador to Vietnam, after President Bill Clinton extended full diplomatic relations to that country in 1995.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>In March 2011, New York Senator Chuck Schumer endorsed Kelly to become the next Director of the FBI, and in July 2013, he endorsed Kelly to become Secretary of Homeland Security.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In March 2014, he was appointed as President of Risk Management Services at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a New York City-based commercial real estate services firm. In 2015, the New York Post reported that Kelly was considering a run for New York City Mayor, citing his "Love for New York City".

<p>Kelly was born in 1941 and raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, to James F. Kelly, a milkman, and Elizabeth Kelly, a dressing-room checker at Macy's.
A fitness buff since his teens, Kelly still regularly lifts weights and does aerobic exercises. He is also a fashionable dresser, favoring custom-made shirts that he takes to Geneva, a shirtmaker, for laundering. He also favors silk ties by Charvet. "A tie is the only true way men can make some sort of statement", Kelly has stated, citing Barack Obama as another fan of the high-end French label. "I can tell when someone's wearing Charvet from a distance – even dark colors stand out." Claiming that good-quality clothing enhances his public image as an authority figure, he orders custom hand-tailored suits from master tailor Martin Greenfield, who numbers politicians and movie stars among his clientele and whose suits run in the four figures.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Kelly met his future wife Veronica on the beach at Island Park, New York where his family had a summer residence.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Kelly is the father of Greg Kelly, former co-host of the local Fox morning television show <i>Good Day New York</i>.

<p>Kelly is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. He received his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in 1963. In 1965, he went to the Republic of Vietnam with the 2nd Battalion 1st Marines. As a First Lieutenant in Vietnam, Kelly led Marines in battle for most of his 12 months in country, including participation in Operation Harvest Moon. Upon returning to the U.S., Raymond Kelly joined the Reserves and retired after 30 years of service with the rank of Colonel from the Marine Corps Reserves.

<p>Kelly joined the New York City Police Department as a police cadet in 1960. Six years later in 1966, Kelly officially joined NYPD. He graduated first in his class from the New York City Police Academy and passed the sergeant's test upon returning from Vietnam. This meteoric ascent combined with relative inexperience as a beat cop has prompted some criticisms from colleagues. According to Geoffrey Gray who wrote in <i>New York Magazine</i>, "Some retired cops say Kelly's swift ascent makes him a boss who doesn't understand the street. 'He's not a cop,' says one retired chief, dismissively. 'He's on patrol for a blink of an eye and tells guys on patrol ten years how to do their jobs.' Says another, 'He gives you all the ingredients to make shrimp scampi and says he wants sirloin steak.'"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>However, his long service stands in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, Bernard Kerik. Kerik served as an NYPD officer for only 8 years before he was appointed commissioner by Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_Deputy_Commissioner">First Deputy Commissioner</span></h3>
<p>On February 9, 1990, Kelly was appointed First Deputy Commissioner during the administration of Mayor David Dinkins. Kelly's boss was New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, who was a former Houston Police Chief and the future mayor of Houston.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Kelly was promoted from a Two-Star Assistant Chief to the First Deputy position over several Three-Star Bureau Chiefs, and the Four-Star Chief of Department, Robert J. Johnston Jr.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>At the time Johnston was so powerful, Brown altered the traditional hierarchy by announcing that Johnston would report directly to the Police Commissioner rather than the First Deputy as had been called for under the former departmental structure. This was done to prevent Johnston from having to report to his former subordinate, Kelly.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="37th_NYC_Police_Commissioner">37th NYC Police Commissioner</span></h2>
<p>On October 16, 1992, Mayor Dinkins appointed Kelly as the 37th Police Commissioner of the City of New York. Kelly took over a police department that was 11.5% black, in a city with an over 25% black population. At 9 am on his first full day as Police Commissioner, Kelly was on the "black-owned" radio station WLIB for 40 minutes talking to host Art Whaley, as well as callers, to discuss minority recruitment. He showed himself a master of outreach and even attended black church services in an effort to recruit minority policemen.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The national decline in both violent crime and property crime began in 1993, during the early months of Raymond Kelly's commissioner-ship under Dinkins. A firm believer in community policing, Kelly helped spur the decline in New York by instituting the Safe Streets, Safe City program, which put thousands more cops on the streets, where they would be visible to and able to get to know and interact with local communities. As the 37th Commissioner, he also pursued quality of life issues, such as the "squeegee men" that had become a sign of decay in the city. The murder rate in New York city had declined from its 1990 mid-Dinkins administration historic high of 2,254 to 1,927, when Kelly left in 1994, and continued to plummet even more steeply under Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg. The decline continued when Kelly returned as commissioner under Mayor Bloomberg in 2002–2013.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1993_NYPD_handgun_transition">1993 NYPD handgun transition</span></h3>
<p>In August 1993, Kelly introduced the 9mm semi-automatic pistol as an option for officers. The Glock 19, SIG Sauer P226, and Smith &amp; Wesson 5946 pistols were approved for duty to replace the NYPD's Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 and Model 64 double-action only revolvers chambered in .38 Special. Himself a former street cop, Kelly was concerned about the semi-automatic pistols' propensity for sustaining firearm malfunctions. Indeed, at a media event introducing the new semi-automatic pistols in January 1993, one of the firearms malfunctioned just moments after a deputy inspector explained that malfunctions and failures were the semi-automatic pistol's major design drawback.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transition">Transition</span></h2>
<p>In November 1993, Rudolph Giuliani defeated Mayor Dinkins in his run for a second term as Mayor of New York City. Giuliani then replaced Kelly with Boston Police Commissioner William Bratton. Coincidentally, Giuliani and Kelly had known each other for a long time; they were two years apart at Manhattan College three decades previously.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="41st_NYC_Police_Commissioner">41st NYC Police Commissioner</span></h2>
<p>As Commissioner of the NYPD under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Kelly had often appeared at outreach events such as the Brooklyn's annual West Indian Day Parade, where he was photographed playing the drums and speaking to community leaders. Bloomberg and Kelly, however, continued to place heavy reliance on the CompStat system, initiated by Bill Bratton and since adopted by police departments in other cities worldwide. The system, while recognized as highly effective in reducing crime, also puts pressure on local precincts to reduce the number of reports for the seven major crimes while increasing the number of lesser arrests. The two men continued and indeed stepped up Mayor Giuliani's controversial stop-and-frisk policy, which was determined in US District Court to be an unconstitutional form of racial profiling. In the first half of 2011 the NYC police made 362,150 such stops, constituting a 13.5 percent increase from the same period in 2010, according to WNYC radio (which also reported that 84 percent of the people stopped were either black or Latino, and that "nine out 10 stops did not result in any arrest or ticket.") According to New York State Senator Eric Adams,  "Kelly was one of the great humanitarians in policing under David Dinkins. I don't know what happened to him that all of a sudden his philosophical understanding of the importance of community and police liking each other has changed. Sometimes the expeditious need of bringing down crime numbers bring out the worst in us. So instead of saying let's just go seek out the bad guy, we get to the point of, 'Let's go get them all.' If Kelly can't philosophically change, then we need to have a leadership change at the top."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Under Bloomberg, Commissioner Kelly also revamped New York City's Police Department into a world-class counter-terrorism operation, operating in conjunction with the CIA. Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks there were fewer than two dozen officers working on terrorism full time; ten years later there were over 1,000. One of Kelly's innovations was his unprecedented stationing of New York City police detectives in other cities throughout the world following terrorist attacks in those cities, with a view to determining if they are in any way connected to the security of New York. In the cases of both the March 11, 2004, Madrid bombing and the July 7, 2005 London bombings and July 21, 2005 London bombings, NYPD detectives were on the scene within a day to relay pertinent information back to New York. An August 2011 article by the Associated Press reported the NYCPD's extensive use of undercover agents (colloquially referred to as "rakers" and "mosque crawlers") to keep tabs, even build databases, on stores, restaurants, mosques. and clubs. NYPD spokesman Paul Browne denied that police trawled ethnic neighborhoods, telling the AP that officers only follow leads. He also dismissed the idea of "mosque crawlers," saying, "Someone has a great imagination."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>According to <i>Mother Jones</i> columnist Adam Serwer, "The FBI was reportedly so concerned about the legality of the NYPD's program that it refused to accept information that came out of it." Valerie Caproni, the FBI's general counsel, told the AP that the FBI is barred from sending agents into mosques looking for leads outside of a specific investigation and said the practice would raise alarms. "If you're sending an informant into a mosque when there is no evidence of wrongdoing, that's a very high-risk thing to do," she was quoted as saying. "You're running right up against core constitutional rights. You're talking about freedom of religion."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Under Mayor Bloomberg, Kelly's NYPD also incurred criticism for its handling of the protests surrounding the 2004 Republican National Convention, which resulted in the City of New York having to pay out millions in settlement of lawsuits for false arrest and civil rights violations, as well as for its rough treatment of credentialed reporters covering the 2011 Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>On March 5, 2007, it was announced that a Rikers Island inmate offered to pay an undercover police officer posing as a hit man to behead Kelly as well as bomb police headquarters in retaliation for the controversial police shooting of Sean Bell.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In 2013 his visit to Brown University was met with a demonstration against what protestors saw as increased racial profiling and violations of civil rights under Kelly's leadership as NYPD Commissioner.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>In November 2014 it was reported that Mr. Kelly would no longer require a $1.5 million security team. With his transformation from top cop to just some guy who works in real estate nearly complete. Kelly is looking forward to taking care of himself. Since leaving office, Kelly has had 24-hour-a-day protection from a security detail that consists of a NYPD lieutenant, three sergeants, and six detectives. With their $140,000 salaries (plus overtime), the ten-man team cost New York City taxpayers $1.5 million — a necessary expense, the NYPD argued, thanks to the threats Kelly and his family received as a result of his work. Kelly determined he was no longer the target he once was and will be relieving his publicly funded security detail on New Year's Day so that the resources can be deployed elsewhere.

The next day, Kelly said he was "flattered" by Obama's praise but otherwise refused to confirm or deny whether he was interested in the Secretary position. Describing "a growing campaign to quash the potential nomination of New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security", the <i>Huffington Post</i> cited a July 18 letter to Obama from a coalition of Muslim groups; the letter stated in part, "Commissioner Kelly's legacy in New York is synonymous with divisive, harmful, and ineffective policing that promotes stereotypes and profiling". On July 22, Kelly penned a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> opinion article defending the NYPD's programs, stating "the average number of stops we conduct is less than one per officer per week" and that this and other practices have led to "7,383 lives saved—and...they are largely the lives of young men of color." 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>On October 17, 2013, President Obama moved to nominate Jeh Johnson to be United States Secretary of Homeland Security. <i>The Washington Post</i> reported "Johnson, an African-American, would bring further racial diversity to Obama's Cabinet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Clashes_with_civil_liberties_group_over_transparency">Clashes with civil liberties group over transparency</span></h2>
<p>On October 16, 2011, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan seeking to force the New York Police Department to release the daily schedules of Commissioner Kelly, whom it characterized as "the most important appointed official" in city government. According to the suit the details of whom Kelly meets with remain largely shrouded in secrecy, in marked contrast to those of other high-placed officials, including the President of the United States, who are required to publicly disclose portions of their schedules. New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo last month began posting a detailed version of his daily schedules online. "There is no good reason for Commissioner Kelly to withhold this information from the public," Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the civil liberties group, said in a statement. "If it's safe for the leader of the country to disclose his schedule, then it's safe for the N.Y.P.D. commissioner to do the same."
In Mr. Kelly's defense, Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, argued that a police commissioner should get "broad latitude" in a post-terrorist era. According to Professor Moss, "The police commissioner of New York City occupies a special, appointed position. He's our secretary of defense, head of the C.I.A. and, I would say, chief architect rolled into one. He may be the one person who we should treat with some respect on his privacy."
