<p>The <b>National Hockey League</b> (<b>NHL</b>; French</a>: <i lang="fr">Ligue nationale de hockey—LNH</i>) is a professional ice hockey</a> league</a> in North America, currently comprising 31 teams: 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world,<sup id="cite_ref-premier_5-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada</a>. The Stanley Cup</a>, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America,<sup id="cite_ref-NHL.comFunFacts_6-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The National Hockey League was organized on November 26, 1917, at the Windsor Hotel</a> in Montreal</a> after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association</a> (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew, Ontario</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The NHL immediately took the NHA's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and folds left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>At its inception, the NHL had four teams—all in Canada, thus the adjective "National" in the league's name. The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the Boston Bruins</a> joined, and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams. From 1942 to 1967, the league had only six teams, collectively (if not contemporaneously) nicknamed the "Original Six</a>". The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion</a>. The league then increased to 18 teams in 1974 and 21 teams in 1979. In the 1990s, the NHL further expanded to 30 teams, and added its 31st team in 2017.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The league's headquarters have been in New York City</a> since 1989 when the head office moved there from Montreal.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>After a labour-management dispute</a> that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 season</a>, the league resumed play in 2005–06 under a new collective agreement</a> that included a salary cap</a>. In 2009</a>, the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships, attendance, and television audiences.<sup id="cite_ref-JohnCollins_9-0" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF) considers the Stanley Cup to be one of the "most important championships available to the sport".<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The NHL draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from approximately 20 countries.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the league, with an increasing percentage of American and European players in recent seasons.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The current NHL Champions are the Washington Capitals</a>, who defeated the Vegas Golden Knights</a> four games to one in the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h3>
<p>The National Hockey League was established in 1917 as the successor to the National Hockey Association</a> (NHA). Founded in 1909, the NHA began play one year later</a> with seven teams in Ontario</a> and Quebec</a>, and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey.

<p>The NHL consists of 31 teams, 24 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada. The NHL divides the 31 teams into two conferences: the Eastern Conference</a> and the Western Conference</a>. Each conference is split into two divisions</a>: the Eastern Conference contains 16 teams (eight per division), while the Western Conference has 15 teams (seven in the Central Division and eight in the Pacific Division). The current alignment has existed since the 2017–18 season</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>The number of NHL teams held constant at 30 teams from the 2000–01 season</a> when the Minnesota Wild</a> and the Columbus Blue Jackets</a> joined the league as expansion teams, until 2017. That expansion capped a period in the 1990s of rapid expansion and relocation when the NHL added 9 teams to grow from 21 to 30 teams, and relocated four teams mostly from smaller northern cities (e.g., Hartford, Quebec) to larger warmer metropolitan areas (e.g., Dallas, Phoenix). The league has not contracted any teams since the Cleveland Barons folded in 1978. The league expanded for the first time in 17 years<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> to 31 teams in 2017 with the addition of the Vegas Golden Knights</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Vegas_expansion_51-1" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> On December 7, 2017, an ownership group from Seattle applied for an expansion franchise to be the 32nd team.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>According to <i>Forbes</a></i>, in 2017, all five of the most valuable teams were "Original Six</a>" teams: the New York Rangers</a> at approximately $1.5&#160;billion, the Toronto Maple Leafs</a> at $1.4&#160;billion, the Montreal Canadiens</a> at $1.25&#160;billion, the Chicago Blackhawks</a> at $1&#160;billion, and the Boston Bruins</a> at $890&#160;million.<sup id="cite_ref-valuable_teams_74-0" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> At least eight NHL clubs operate at a loss. NHL teams are susceptible to the Canadian–U.S. exchange rate: revenue from tickets, local and national advertising in Canada, and local and national Canadian media rights are collected in Canadian dollars</a>, but all players' salaries are paid in U.S. dollars regardless of whether a team is located in Canada or the U.S.<sup id="cite_ref-valuable_teams_74-1" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Each National Hockey League regulation game is 60 minutes long. The game is composed of three 20-minute periods with an intermission between periods.<sup id="cite_ref-intermission_75-0" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> 
At the end of regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, overtime</a> ensues. During the regular season, overtime is a five-minute, three-on-three sudden-death</a> period, in which whoever scores a goal first will win the game.

<p>If the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a shootout</a>. Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot</a>. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds, the shootout continues but becomes sudden-death.

The rules themselves have evolved directly from the first organized indoor ice hockey game</a> in Montreal</a> in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules. The NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing most professional</a> and major junior ice hockey leagues</a> in North America. Infractions of the rules, such as offside</a> and icing</a>, lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent face-offs</a>, while more serious infractions leading to penalties to the offending teams. The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game. The penalty shot</a> was adopted from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a> to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005–06 season</a>, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the "offside pass" or "two-line pass" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's defending zone</a> was completed on the offensive side of the centre line</a>, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.<sup id="cite_ref-newoffside_88-0" class="reference">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup> Furthermore, the league reinstated the "tag-up offside" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.<sup id="cite_ref-newoffside_88-1" class="reference">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup> The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,<sup id="cite_ref-newoffside_88-2" class="reference">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup> which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap</a>. Since 2005, when a team is guilty of icing the puck</a> they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following face-off</a> (except to replace an injured player or re-install a pulled goaltender</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-icing_89-0" class="reference">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup> Since 2013, the league has used <i>hybrid icing</i>, where a linesman</a> stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face-off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck.<sup id="cite_ref-icing_89-1" class="reference">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>The league's rules differ from the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF), as used in tournaments such as the Olympics</a>, which were themselves derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPodnieksSzemberg2007198_90-0" class="reference">&#91;88&#93;</a></sup> In the NHL, fighting</a> leads to <i>major penalties</i> while IIHF rules, and most amateur rules, call for the ejection of fighting players.<sup id="cite_ref-major_91-0" class="reference">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-fighting_iihf_92-0" class="reference">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup> Usually, a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus short-handed</a> for the duration of the penalty,<sup id="cite_ref-minor_93-0" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> but if the penalties are coincidental, for example when two players fight, both teams remain at full strength. Also, unlike minor penalties, major penalties must be served to their full completion, regardless of number of goals scored during the power play.<sup id="cite_ref-minor_93-1" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> The NHL and IIHF differ also in playing rules, such as icing, the areas of play for goaltenders, helmet rules, officiating rules, timeouts and play reviews.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players. Players are banned from gambling</a> and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 bargaining agreement</a>. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup>

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Season structure of the NHL</a></div>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">See also: List of NHL seasons</a></div>
<p>The National Hockey League season is divided into a regular season</a> (from early October through early to mid April) and a postseason (the Stanley Cup playoffs</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. In the regular season, each team plays 82 games: 41 games each of home and road. Eastern teams play 28 games in their own geographic division—four against each of their seven other divisional opponents—and 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference. Western teams play 26 or 29 games in their own geographic division—four or five against each of their six or seven other divisional opponents—and 21 or 24 games against the six or seven remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference, with one cross-division intra-conference match-up occurring in four games. All teams play every team in the other conference twice—home and road.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>The league's regular season standings are based on a point system. Two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime</a> or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league's overall leader is awarded the Presidents' Trophy</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>The Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven</a> series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup</a> champion. Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs</a>: the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points.<sup id="cite_ref-nhl_playoff_format_96-0" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> The Stanley Cup playoffs</a> are an elimination tournament</a> where the teams are grouped in pairs to play best-of-seven</a> series and the winners moving on to the next round.<sup id="cite_ref-nhl_playoff_format_96-1" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup</a> Final. In all rounds, the higher-ranked team is awarded home-ice advantage</a>, with four of the seven games played at this team's home venue. In the Stanley Cup Final, the team with the most points during the regular season has home-ice advantage.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Entry_Draft">Entry Draft</span></h2>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: NHL Entry Draft</a></div>
<p>The annual NHL Entry Draft</a> consists of a seven-round off-season draft</a> held in late June. Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 15 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 28th and 29th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 30th pick and the Stanley Cup champions the 31st pick.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams_2">Teams</span></h3>
<p>The most prestigious team award is the Stanley Cup</a>, which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the Presidents' Trophy</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>The Montreal Canadiens</a> are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL's championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 Stanley Cup championships</a> (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues</a> in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the New York Yankees</a> of Major League Baseball</a>, who have three more.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955–56 to 1959–60.<sup id="cite_ref-list_stanley_cup_97-0" class="reference">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup> The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN</a> as the second greatest sports team of all-time.<sup id="cite_ref-greatest_team_98-0" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>The next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs</a> with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings</a>, with 11 Stanley Cup</a> championships, are the most successful American franchise.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>The same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup</a>, much like its CFL</a> counterpart</a>, is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the Vince Lombardi Trophy</a>, Larry O'Brien Trophy</a>, and Commissioner's Trophy</a>, which have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Players">Players</span></h3>
<p>There are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the Art Ross Trophy</a> for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy</a> for the goal-scoring leader, and the William M. Jennings Trophy</a> for the goaltender</a>(s) for the team with the fewest goals against them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>The other player trophies are voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association</a> or the team general managers.<sup id="cite_ref-awards_99-0" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded. The most prestigious individual award is the Hart Memorial Trophy</a> which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player</a>; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The Vezina Trophy</a> is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The James Norris Memorial Trophy</a> is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the Calder Memorial Trophy</a> is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy</a> is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.

<p>In addition to the regular season awards, the Conn Smythe Trophy</a> is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the Jack Adams Award</a> as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony.<sup id="cite_ref-awards_99-1" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players, who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters, the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played. Since the collapse</a> of the Soviet Bloc, political/ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared, leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia into the NHL. Swedes, Finns, and other Western Europeans, who were always free to move to North America, came to the league in greater numbers than before.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>Many of the league's top players in recent years have come from these European countries including Daniel Alfredsson</a>, Erik Karlsson</a>, Henrik Sedin</a>, Daniel Sedin</a>, Henrik Lundqvist</a>, Jaromir Jagr</a>, Patrik Elias</a>, Zdeno Chara</a>, Pavel Datsyuk</a>, Evgeni Malkin</a>, Nicklas Lidstrom</a> and Alexander Ovechkin</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Europe_103-0" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup> European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more "skilled offensive players",<sup id="cite_ref-europe2_104-0" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup> although recently<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous.

<p>Historically, the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues. The league's American broadcast partners have been in flux for decades, ranging from such networks as CBS</a>, SportsChannel America</a>, the USA Network</a>, Fox</a>, ABC</a>, and ESPN</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">71</span></p><p>National U.S. television rights are currently held by NBC Sports</a>; its current 10-year, US$2&#160;billion contract, which began in the 2011–12 season</a>, extended and unified rights deals that were first established in the 2005–06</a> season, when Comcast</a> acquired cable rights to replace ESPN, and NBC</a> acquired broadcast television rights under a revenue-sharing agreement to replace ABC</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-nysun_130-0" class="reference">&#91;128&#93;</a></sup> NBC Sports Network</a> and the company negotiated a new, 10-year, unified rights deal worth nearly US$2&#160;billion.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference">&#91;129&#93;</a></sup> Under this contract, NBCSN usually airs at least two regular season games per week, while NBC airs afternoon games on selected weekends. NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games, all games televised by the NBC network, and every game in the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning in the second round. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with other games shown on CNBC</a>, USA Network</a>, NHL Network</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">72</span></p><p>As in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market, and are subject to blackout</a> outside of them. These broadcasters include regional sports network</a> chains. Certain national telecasts on NBCSN are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: NHL Network (United States)</a> and NHL Network (Canada)</a></div>
<p>The league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is <i>NHL Tonight</a></i>. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team's regional broadcasters. 
The U.S. version simulcasts selected regular season games nationally that are not aired by NBC Sports, as well as be used as an overflow channel during the playoffs.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">See also: List of international ice hockey competitions featuring NHL players</a></div>
<p>The National Hockey League has occasionally participated in international club competitions. Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or NHLPA. The first international club competition was held in 1976</a>, with eight NHL teams playing against the Soviet Championship League</a>'s HC CSKA Moscow</a>, and Krylya Sovetov Moscow</a>. Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL, and the Soviet Championship League would hold a number of exhibition games between the two leagues known as the Super Series</a>. No NHL club had played a Russian-based club from the end of the Super Series in 1991 to 2008, when the New York Rangers faced Metallurg Magnitogorsk</a> in the 2008 Victoria Cup</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">79</span></p><p>In addition to the Russian clubs, NHL clubs had participated in a number of international club exhibitions and competitions with various European-based clubs. The first exhibition game to feature an NHL team against a European-based team (aside from clubs based in the former Soviet Union) was in December 1977, when the New York Rangers faced Poldi Kladno</a> of the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League</a>. In the 2000s the NHL had organized four NHL Challenge</a> series between NHL, and European clubs. From 2007 to 2011, the NHL organized exhibition games prior to the beginning of the season, known as the NHL Premiere, between NHL clubs and teams from a number of European leagues. The 2011 NHL Premiere</a> was the last NHL-organized club competition involving European teams. NHL clubs have also participated in IIHF-organized club tournaments. The most recent IIHF-organized event including a NHL club was the 2009 Victoria Cup</a>, between the Swiss National League A</a>'s ZSC Lions</a>, and the Chicago Blackhawks.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">80</span></p><p>From 1998 to 2014, during the quadrennial Winter Olympic</a> years, the NHL suspended its all-star game and expanded the traditional all-star break to allow NHL players to represent their countries in the Olympic ice hockey tournament</a>; starting 2018, because the All-Star game is held in late January, there would be no Olympic break. Conversely, the annual Ice Hockey World Championships</a> are held every May at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs. Thus, NHL players generally only join their respective country's team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention, or did not make the playoffs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">81</span></p><p>In 2007, the International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF) formalized the "Triple Gold Club</a>", the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal, and the Stanley Cup.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference">&#91;133&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-expands_136-0" class="reference">&#91;134&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference">&#91;135&#93;</a></sup> The term had first entered popular use following the 2002 Winter Olympics</a>, which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.<sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference">&#91;136&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference">&#91;137&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-140" class="reference">&#91;138&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">82</span></p><p>As well as participating in the above international club competitions, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association organizes the World Cup of Hockey</a>. Unlike the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation, the World Cup of Hockey is played under NHL-rules and not those of the IIHF. The tournament takes place prior to the NHL pre-season. The event is planned to be a quadrennial event beginning in 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-sn-wch2016_141-0" class="reference">&#91;139&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, along with Major League Baseball</a>, the National Football League</a>, and the National Basketball Association</a>. The league is very prominent in Canada, where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports as alongside CFL</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Canadian_Press_2006-06-08_142-0" class="reference">&#91;140&#93;</a></sup> Overall, hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues, the smallest revenue from television, and the least sponsorship.<sup id="cite_ref-affluent_143-0" class="reference">&#91;141&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">84</span></p><p>The NHL holds one of the most affluent fan bases.<sup id="cite_ref-affluent_143-1" class="reference">&#91;141&#93;</a></sup> Studies by the Sports Marketing Group conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL's fan base is much more affluent than that of the PGA Tour</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-144" class="reference">&#91;142&#93;</a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s). (June 2013)">not in citation given</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> A study done by the Stanford Graduate School of Business</a> in 2004, found that NHL fans in America were the most educated and affluent of the four major leagues. Further it noted that season-ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the financial ability of the NHL fan to purchase them.<sup id="cite_ref-affluent_143-2" class="reference">&#91;141&#93;</a></sup> According to Reuters</a> in 2010, the largest demographic of NHL fans was highly sought after group males aged 18–34.<sup id="cite_ref-145" class="reference">&#91;143&#93;</a></sup>
The NHL estimates that half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets. Beginning in 2008, the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">85</span></p><p>The debut of the Winter Classic</a>, an outdoor regular season NHL game held on New Year's Day</a> 2008, was a major success for the league. The game has since become an annual staple of the NHL schedule. This, along with the transition to a national "Game of the Week" and an annual "Hockey Day in America" regional coverage, all televised on NBC, has helped increase the NHL's regular season television viewership in the United States.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2015)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> These improvements led NBC and the cable channel Versus</a> to sign a ten-year broadcast deal, paying US$200&#160;million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">86</span></p><p>This television contract has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL. The 2010 Stanley Cup</a> playoffs saw the largest audience in the history of the sport "after a regular season that saw record-breaking business success, propelled in large part by the NHL's strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings."<sup id="cite_ref-146" class="reference">&#91;144&#93;</a></sup> This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue.
