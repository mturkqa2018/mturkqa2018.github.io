<p>The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Chico were the Mechoopda Maidu Native Americans. The City of Chico was founded in 1860 by John Bidwell, a member of one of the first wagon trains to reach California in 1843. During the American Civil War, Camp Bidwell (named for John Bidwell, by then a Brigadier General of the California Militia), was established a mile outside Chico, by Lt. Col. A. E. Hooker with a company of cavalry and two of infantry, on August 26, 1863.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p></a><p>By early 1865 it was being referred to as Camp Chico when a post called Camp Bidwell was established in northeast California, later to be Fort Bidwell. The city became incorporated January 8, 1872.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p></a><p>Chico was home to a significant Chinese American community when it was first incorporated, but arsonists burned Chico's Chinatown in February 1886, driving Chinese Americans out of town.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p></a><p>Historian W.H. "Old Hutch" Hutchinson identified five events as the most seminal in Chico history. They included the arrival of John Bidwell in 1850, the arrival of the California and Oregon Railroad in 1870, the establishment in 1887 of the Northern Branch of the State Normal School, which later became California State University, Chico (Chico State), the purchase of the Sierra Lumber Company by the Diamond Match Company in 1900, and the development of the Army Air Base, which is now the Chico Municipal Airport.
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p></a><p>Several other significant events have unfolded in Chico more recently. These include the construction and relocation of Route 99E through town in the early 1960s, the founding of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in 1979—what would become one of the top breweries in the nation—and the establishment of a "Green Line" on the western city limits as protection of agricultural lands.

<p>Chico is at the northeast edge of the Sacramento Valley, one of the richest agricultural areas in the world. The Sierra Nevada mountains lie to the east and south, with Chico's city limits venturing several miles into the foothills. To the west, the Sacramento River lies 5 miles (8 km) from the city limits.

<p>Chico sits on the Sacramento Valley floor close to the foothills of the Cascade Range to the north and the Sierra Nevada range to the east and south. Big Chico Creek is the demarcation line between the ranges. The city's terrain is generally flat with increasingly hilly terrain beginning at the eastern city limits.
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p></a><p>According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 27.8 square miles (72 km), of which 27.7 square miles (72 km) is land and 0.04% is water.
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p></a><p>The city is bisected by Bidwell Park, which runs 5 miles (8 km) from the flat city center deep into the foothills.
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p></a><p>The city is also traversed by two creeks and a flood channel, which feeds the Sacramento River. They are named Big Chico Creek, Little Chico Creek, and Lindo Channel (also known as Sandy Gulch, locally).

<p>Downtown Chico is located generally between Big Chico Creek and Little Chico Creek. The downtown has a street grid offset 49.75° from the four cardinal directions. There are numbered streets and avenues, which generally run east-northeast to west-southwest. Blocks are usually addressed in hundreds corresponding to the numbered streets and avenues. While the east-northeast to west-southwest streets and avenues are numbered, streets running north-northwest to south-southeast are generally named after trees. The part of the "tree" streets that intersect the Chico State campus spell the word "CHICO" at Chestnut, Hazel, Ivy, Cherry, and Orange streets.
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p></a><p>The main thoroughfare running northwest–southeast through the city is State Route Business 99, not to be confused with Highway 99. Business 99 has several common names. From Northwest to Southeast, these are Esplanade, Main Street/Broadway (these are one-way southeast and northwest, respectively, in downtown Chico), Main Street/Oroville Avenue (similarly one-way), Park Avenue, and Midway. The city streets are designated as "east" or "west" by their relation to this street.
<a name="text16"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p></a><p>There are numbered streets and avenues both of which flow east–west. This fact can cause confusion. The "streets" are south of the Chico State campus through downtown, while the "avenues" are north of campus through The Esplanade. There are no left turns permitted onto any odd numbered avenue from The Esplanade, in either direction, with the exception of West 11th Avenue.
<a name="text17"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p></a><p>In the numbered streets and avenues and most other streets that intersect The Esplanade, Main, and Park, the west addresses are all numbers whose last two digits are 00 through 49 and the east addresses are all numbers whose last two digits are 50 through 99. There are few exceptions. On most Chico streets odd addresses are on the south side of the street.
<a name="text18"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p></a><p>Standing at the bridge over the Big Chico Creek—where Main Street changes to The Esplanade—and facing north, the odd addresses are on the left. (Bidwell Mansion is 525 The Esplanade.) This convention holds for all the numbered avenues. However, while facing south the odd addresses are still on the left (i.e., the convention has switched). This convention holds throughout the numbered streets.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p></a><p>Many streets in Chico, most notably Nord Avenue/Walnut Street, change street names after small bridges. When the city was being built, these streets were on the outskirts of town and did not require bridge building. Modern residents of Chico use these streets frequently, and the name changes can cause confusion.

<p><b>Downtown Chico</b> – This is the main commercial district in Chico. It is located generally between the Big Chico Creek and Little Chico Creek between Wall Street and Salem Street. The Downtown Chico Business Association represents the interests of the downtown to the community. Main Street and Broadway are the two main thoroughfares bisecting the downtown. Ringel Park is the triangular-shaped area immediately north of downtown. The Chico City Plaza is the central point of downtown, between Fourth and Fifth Streets. The area of West Ninth Street where Main Street and Oroville Avenue converge is known as The Junction, the southernmost part of the downtown. "The Junction", as the confluence of Humboldt Road and the old Shasta Stage Road (now Main Street and The Esplanade), got its name in the early 1860s when John Bidwell and partners established a company that created a stage line between Chico and Susanville, ultimately leading to Ruby City, Idaho, and the rich gold strikes there. This is the place where Humboldt Road began; it is now called Humboldt Avenue until it reaches the Highway 99 freeway, then regains the Humboldt Road name on the eastern side as it continues into the foothills. "The Junction" was for some years a business district unto itself, providing goods and services to people arriving at and departing from the stage depot.
<a name="text21"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p></a><p><b>South Campus</b> – The South Campus neighborhood is the area bounded by West Second Street, Salem Street, West Ninth Street and the western city limits (which is called "The Green Line"). Historically, this area was the first residential area established in the city. Currently, it is the most densely populated area of the city. The South Campus Neighborhood Association represents the interests of the neighborhood to the community. South Campus is a dynamic residential neighborhood consisting overwhelmingly of young renters under thirty-five, and specifically Chico State students. The intersection of Fifth and Ivy streets is a neighborhood commercial core sometimes referred to locally as "Five and I." There are many fraternity and sorority houses in the area, and the city has designated a "Fraternity/Sorority Overlay Zone", largely contiguous with the neighborhood. South Campus is home of Craig Hall and Depot Park.
<a name="text22"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p></a><p><b>Barber</b> – The Barber neighborhood is a working class residential neighborhood generally south of Little Chico Creek and west of Park avenue. The Barber Neighborhood Association represents the interests of the neighborhood to the community. This neighborhood was originally built to house the employees of the adjacent Diamond Match Factory. The neighborhood was named after Ohio Columbus Barber, president of the Diamond Match Company. Today, the Diamond Match property is designated for a future development called Barber Yard.
<a name="text23"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p></a><p><b>Chapmantown</b> – This is a working-class residential neighborhood entirely surrounded by area inside the city of Chico, but which itself is not a part of the city. Rather, it is under the jurisdiction of the County of Butte. Chapmantown is currently known as the area bounded by Little Chico Creek, Boucher Street, Guill Street and East Sixteenth Street. The neighborhood south of East Twentieth Street to the east of Fair street is also referred to as Chapmantown. Historically, Chapmantown referred to everything east of Mulberry street, but that is no longer the case. Due to not being within city limits, there are no sidewalks, sewers, or any other city services. However, there are also none of the regulations associated with the municipality either (prohibition on chicken coops, burn permits, etc.) The neighborhood is home to The Dorothy F. Johnson Neighborhood Center, a facility of the Chico Area Recreation District. The neighborhood is named after Augustus Chapman.
<a name="text24"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p></a><p><b>The Avenues</b> – A relatively new name that refers to the area north of Big Chico Creek historically known as Chico Vecino (Spanish for 'neighbor'). This area includes the numbered avenues that intersect The Esplanade. This residential neighborhood is adjacent to the northern boundary of Chico State campus and is south of Lindo Channel. The neighborhood also is home to Enloe Medical Center. The Avenues are known for their beautiful older homes, mature trees and walkability.
<a name="text25"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p></a><p><b>Mansion Park</b> is the high end residential neighborhood adjacent to the Bidwell Mansion, and immediately between the northeast corner of the Chico State campus and Chico High School. This neighborhood is notable for its being a preferred parking zone for residents with permits only, located in an area of the city with very impacted parking. This neighborhood is home to the Albert E. Warrens Reception Center (formerly the Julia Morgan House), and the Bidwell Amphitheatre. Originally, home to mostly university professors and staff, other professionals and upper-middle-class families now also call it home.

<p><b>Doe Mill</b> is a developing "new urbanist" residential neighborhood generally north of East Twentieth Street and East of Bruce Road. Cheerful, colorful homes, welcoming porches, mixed home sizes, and narrow streets that encourage pedestrian rather than vehicular traffic characterize this charming neighborhood.
<a name="text27"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p></a><p><br/>
<b>Nob Hill</b> is the developing residential neighborhood west of Bruce Road and north of Highway 32.
<a name="text28"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p></a><p><b>California Park</b> is the developing residential neighborhood east of Bruce Road and north of Highway 32. This area contains a smaller area known as <b>Canyon Oaks,</b>.
<a name="text29"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p></a><p><b>Aspen Glen</b> is the residential neighborhood east of the Esplanade and north of East Shasta avenue. Many streets there are named after things associated with Colorado.
<a name="text30"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p></a><p><b>Cussick Area Neighborhood</b> is an assortment of different housing types on the northwest end of town. It is flanked by orchards, the Esplanade, and West East Avenue.
<a name="text31"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p></a><p><b>Big Chico Creek Estates</b> is a middle class development in the southwest area of town, Backed by Big Chico Creek, and very close to Chico's newest elementary school.
<a name="text32"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p></a><p><b>Little Chico Creek Estates</b> generally referred to as "Chico Creek Estates", is a middle-class development that is bordered to the north by Little Chico Creek, to the west by Bruce Road, to the South by a seasonal flood control channel and Doe Mill neighborhood and bordered to the east by Stilson Canyon. Prior to its development in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Little Chico Creek Estates was an olive orchard. As a result, the streets in the neighborhood are named after olive varieties.
<a name="text33"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p></a><p><b>Connors Neighborhood</b> is a very small neighborhood squeezed between East East Avenue and Rio Lindo and between the Esplanade and Highway 99. Connors Neighborhood is made up of Connors Ave and White Ave, along with a couple of courts and circles. This neighborhood was incorporated into Chico in 2003; the state plans to add sewers in Q1 of 2011.
<a name="text34"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p></a><p>Other neighborhoods include South Park, North Park, Vallombrosa, Baroni Park, Heritage Oaks and Hancock Park.
<a name="text35"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p></a><p>Chico also is home to several large new urbanist neighborhoods, either planned or under construction, including Doe Mill, Barber Yard, Meriam Park, The Orchard and Westside Place.
<a name="text36"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p></a><p>The above-mentioned "neighborhoods" do not include large sections of Chico. There are numerous other areas that each have unique characteristics and attractions. While some of these areas were not so long ago outside of city limits, they have always been a part of the Chico community. Most of these areas are well established with a high percentage of residents who have lived there for more than 20 years. In the older areas of the outlying neighborhoods, it is not uncommon to find households that have been there for fifty or even more years.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<p>Much of the local economy is driven by the presence of Chico State. Industries providing employment: educational, health and social services (30.3%), retail trade (14.9%), arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services (12.6%).
<a name="text48"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p></a><p>Chico has always been a regional retail shopping destination. Chico's largest retail district is focused around the Chico Mall on East 20th Street. In the two decades since the Chico Mall was constructed, many national retailers have located nearby, including Target, Kohl's, Forever 21, Best Buy, and Walmart. In January 2008, plans were unveiled to remodel the Chico Mall by demolishing the westernmost portion of the mall (previously home to Troutman's) and constructing an open air "lifestyle" shopping center that will connect the mall with the Kohl's shopping center nearby. This has since been amended as Dick's Sporting Goods has renovated both the interior and exterior the space formerly occupied by Troutmans, and officially opened on July 10, 2013.
<a name="text49"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p></a><p>Chico is also home to the North Valley Plaza Mall, which was the city's first enclosed shopping center. Construction on this mall began in 1965 and it was the County's largest shopping center until the Chico Mall was completed in 1988. For a few years the "old" mall and the "new" mall competed against one another. The North Valley Plaza Mall was dealt a blow when JCPenney, one of the old mall's anchors, moved to the Chico Mall in 1993. The "old" mall slowly declined with increasing vacancies. After several failed attempts at revitalization, the North Valley Plaza Mall was overhauled in 2002, with the center of the mall demolished. Several large retailers, such as Trader Joe's, and Tinseltown Theater, are operating at the mall plus a number of restaurants. Mervyn's anchored the mall at the west end, filling the spot vacated by JCPenney, but declared bankruptcy in 2008 and liquidated its entire stock by the end of December of that year. The entire Mervyn's chain ceased operations just before the end of the year. A portion of the space is now being utilized by Goodwill. Other spaces in the North Valley Plaza include a dollar store, 99 cent only store, a U.S. Navy recruiting center and a number of smaller boutiques.
<a name="text50"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p></a><p>Chico's downtown is a thriving area for unique, independent retail shops and restaurants. Farmers markets attract crowds on Saturday mornings and Thursday evenings. City Plaza hosts free concerts regularly during the summer. Performance venues large and small, bars, coffee shops, bookstores and city offices contribute to a lively and flavorful experience.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bicycling">Bicycling</span></h3>
<p>Chico has also gained a reputation as being a bicycle-friendly city. In 1997, Chico was ranked as the number-one cycling city in the nation by <i>Bicycle Magazine</i> and also hosts the Wildflower Century, an annual 100-mile (160 km) bike ride throughout Butte County every April, put on by Chico Velo Cycling Club. The city is in the process of creating a network of bicycle paths, trails and lanes. Some notable bicycle routes include a path leading from The Esplanade to the Chico Airport, a path running from downtown to East Avenue parallel to Hwy 32 along the railroad, a path along Park Avenue continuing down the Midway toward Durham, a path following Little Chico Creek from Bruce Road to Route 99, and a series of paths throughout Bidwell Park, and the Steve Harrison Memorial Bike Path, which bypasses Skyway and takes riders out to Honey Run Road.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture">Agriculture</span></h2>
<p>Almonds are the number one crop in Chico and the surrounding area, only recently edging out rice. Other crops in the area include walnuts, kiwis, olives, peaches, and plums.
<a name="text86"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">86</span></p></a><p>The city is bounded on the west by orchards with thousands of almond trees, and there are still a few pockets of orchards remaining within the contiguous city limits. The trees bloom with a pink/white flower in late February or early March. Millions of bees are brought in for the pollination. The nuts are harvested in late August.
<a name="text87"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">87</span></p></a><p>Walnuts are also a major agricultural production in the area north and west of town. Unlike the almond crops of the area, walnuts do not have the same appeal as they do not bloom in the spring. However, the trees themselves grow much larger, live longer, and are far more resilient to harsh weather than almond trees, which are known to be sensitive to frost and can be felled easily in winter storms. Similar to the almond crops, walnuts are harvested in early September.
<a name="text88"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">88</span></p></a><p>There are several farmers' markets held in Chico:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Air">Air</span></h3>
<p>Chico Municipal Airport serves the area and is north of the city limits. It was served by United Airlines' United Express flights operated by SkyWest Airlines nonstop to San Francisco (SFO). Commercial passenger flights were discontinued by SkyWest on December 2, 2014 due to nonviability as indicated by United Airlines in June 2014. The city administration is trying to restore air service which would be provided by alternate airlines. On July 31, 1961, the first-ever aircraft hijacking on United States soil occurred at the Chico Municipal Airport.
