With sponsors becoming more important with the rising costs in Formula One, many teams wanted to be able to display the logos of their sponsors as clearly as possible.<br><br>The liveries are usually changed for every season in the sport, marking the marketing ideas of the sponsors. Many teams keep some consistency over the years however, like the red colour of Ferrari, which has its origin in a shade of red known as rosso corsa being the national racing colour of Italy. Tobacco and alcohol advertising was common in motorsport, however as bans spread throughout the world teams used an alternate livery which alluded to the tobacco or alcohol sponsor, or entirely eliminated their name when in nations with a ban – this is now only seen on Ferrari's Marlboro sponsored vehicles – where the sponsor is technically banned from advertising in all host nations. At historical events, cars are allowed to use the livery which was used when the car was actively competing.<br><br>Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives (AGS) were founded in Gonfaron, France, in the late 1960s, but only entered Formula One in 1986.<br><br>White<br><br>Philippe Streiff's AGSJH23 from the 1988 Season at Silverstone<br><br>An AGS JH23 from the 1988 Formula One Season<br><br>Alfa Romeo was a Formula One constructor between 1950 and 1951, and again between 1979 and 1985.

Although the cars had many sponsorship logos on them, the main pattern was based on the traditional BMW Motorsport team colours of white with light blue, dark blue and a little red (in an almost purple shade). White is also the original national racing colour of Germany, while white and blue are the colours of Bavaria and of BMW itself.<br><br>On 27 November 2009, BMW agreed to sell the team back to its original founder, Peter Sauber.

This later changed to green and gold, the racing colours of Australia. In 1975 and 1976, Brabham received sponsorship from Martini; in 1976 the color scheme changed from white to red with light blue trim. The primary sponsor changed to Parmalat in 1978, with the cars retaining a variant of the same red and blue colors. With the team's switch to BMW engines in 1982, the new livery consisted of a clean dark blue and white with a stylized BMW "kidney grille" on the nose. This scheme was retained throughout the BMW years, even through a sponsorship change to Olivetti in 1984, until 1989. (This unusual representation of the engine supplier, specifically BMW, in the color scheme was revived by Williams when they debuted their own BMW cars in 2000.) In 1989, Brabham signed with Bioptron, a brand of Zepter International, which continued until the team was bought by Middlebridge Group. Since then, it was sponsored by many Japanese companies like Garage Italiya, a company that imports Italian cars in Japan, Autobacs, Nippon Shinpan, and Mitsukoshi. Prior the swansong of Brabham in 1992, the team raced in blue and pink livery of the Japanese metal group Seikima-II. <br><br>The BT46B "fan car", with main sponsor Parmalat.<br><br>Nelson Piquet's BT49C in Parmalat livery at Monaco in 1981.<br><br>From 1985 until 1988, Brabham raced in Olivetti livery<br><br>The Brabham BT60B in its blue and pink livery.<br><br>After Honda pulled out of F1 at the end of 2008, team boss Ross Brawn struggled to find a buyer to save the team, eventually buying it himself.

Towards the end of the season, the team arranged one-race sponsor deals with a variety of major local companies, including Canon, Mapfre, Itaipava and Qtel.<br><br>Brawn GP dominated the early part of the 2009 season, with Jenson Button winning six of the first seven races. As other teams improved their cars Brawn struggled for pace, but still recorded several podiums during the rest of the year.  Their strong start and consistent finish was enough to secure the Constructors World Championship at the first (and only) attempt, as well as the drivers title with Jenson Button. At the end of the season, the team was purchased by engine suppliers Mercedes-Benz, marking the return of the Silver Arrows after 55 years.<br><br>Jenson Button at 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix, Sepang, Malaysia<br><br>Jenson Button driving the Brawn BGP 001 at the 2009 German Grand Prix.<br><br>Rubens Barrichello driving for Brawn GP at the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix.<br><br>British American Racing competed in Formula One from 1999 to 2005. The name of the team was taken from British American Tobacco which provided the main sponsorship and was livery sponsor through two of its main cigarette brands.  In their debut season, the team wished to have its two cars painted in different liveries (one 555, the other Lucky Strike), but this was forbidden by the rules.  So the team decided on a unique two-sided design, with the blue 555 livery of the right side of the car, and the red and white Luckies livery on the left and a zipper design on the middle.<br><br>2005<br><br>Jacques Villeneuve with Blue-Yellow/White-Red livery at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.<br><br>A Bar 002 in the 2000 season livery<br><br>Jacques Villeneuve driving the BAR 003 at the 2001 Canadian Grand Prix.<br><br>Jacques Villeneuve driving the BAR 003 in the same race<br><br>Jacques Villeneuve driving the BAR 005 with non-tobacco livery replaced with bar code and F1 cars at the 2003 United States Grand Prix.<br><br>Jenson Button driving the BAR 006 at the 2004 United States Grand Prix.<br><br>Takuma Sato celebrating his podium at the 2004 United States GP<br><br>Takuma Sato driving the BAR 007 with "Racing Revolution" logo at the 2005 United States Grand Prix.<br><br>Jenson Button driving the BAR 007 with "555 World Racing" livery at the 2005 Chinese Grand Prix.<br><br>A BRM Type 15 from 1951 season<br><br>A BRM P30 MKII from the 1953 season<br><br>The British Racing Partnership privately entered BRM P25 with which Stirling Moss took second place in the 1959 British Grand Prix.<br><br>A BRM P25 with its black livery at Silverstone Classic<br><br>A BRM P48 from 1960 season being demonstrated at Mallory Park<br><br>A BRM P57 from 1962 season seen in action.<br><br>A BRM P261 from 1964 season being demonstrated at Goodwood Festival of Speed<br><br>The four wheel-drive BRM P67 from the 1964 season<br><br>A BRM P83 from 1966 season<br><br>A BRM P126 from 1968 season<br><br>Pedro Rodriguez with BRM 1968<br><br>A BRM P160 from 1969 season<br><br>A 1970 BRM in Yardley Livery<br><br>A 1972 BRM in Marlboro Livery<br><br>A 1973 BRM in Marlboro Livery<br><br>A BRM P201 from 1974 being demonstrated at Mallory Park<br><br>The Lotus team, which made its début in 2010, was renamed to Caterham F1 in 2012.

Over the years, rosso corsa has been combined with white parts and with various sponsorship schemes, but Ferrari has never fully let their cars be dominated by the sponsorship livery like many other teams have. This changed in the 1990s when Ferrari replaced their traditional rosso corsa colour with a "Marlboro red" which is noticeably lighter; this colour remains despite the ban on tobacco sponsorship.<br><br>With the exception of the 1964 United States and Mexican Grands Prix, Ferrari has always raced in the Italian national racing colour of rosso corsa.
