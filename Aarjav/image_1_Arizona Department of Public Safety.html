<center><h1>When was the Department of Public Safety of Arizona established?</h1><br><br><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Arizona-StateSeal.svg/140px-Arizona-StateSeal.svg.png'><br><h2></h2></center>Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZDPS) is a state-level law enforcement agency with a primary function of patrolling and enforcing state laws on Arizona highways . The Director is Frank L. Milstead, who began his 4-year term in February 2015. Its headquarters are in Phoenix.<br><br>Following legislation in 1968, the Arizona Department of Public Safety was established by the executive order of Arizona Governor Jack Williams on July 1, 1969. This order amalgamated the functions and responsibilities of the Arizona Highway Patrol, the Law Enforcement Division of the state Department of Liquor Licenses and Control, and the Narcotics Division of the state Department of Law.<br><br>In its 50-plus years of service, the department has become an organization dedicated to protecting and providing state-level law enforcement services to the public and developing partnerships with agencies sharing similar missions.<br><br>The department consists of five divisions - Office of the Director, Highway Patrol, Criminal Investigations, Technical Services and Agency Support. Together these five divisions provide scientific, technical, operational, and regulatory services to Arizona residents and to the state's criminal justice community; one of the more famous subdivisions of the Criminal Investigations Division is the Gang and Immigration Intelligence Team Enforcement Mission task force (better known as "GIITEM"), which was formed to combat the growing gang infestation problems mainly in Maricopa County (the Phoenix area), even though their jurisdiction is statewide. <br><br><br><br>In 2011, the Arizona State Capitol Police department was merged with DPS, alongside the Highway Patrol Division. ASCP was responsible for the State Capitol Mall in Phoenix and the Tucson State Complex. Today the Capitol Police still exist and patrol the Capitol grounds, but they are now full DPS officers and use DPS cars, logos, and uniforms. Capitol police officers wear special Capitol Police patches on their uniforms.<br><br>For much of its history, the sworn members of the department were known as officers or patrolmen.  In early 2015, a change in title was initiated at the agency that resulted in its sworn personnel becoming known as State Troopers. The change in title from patrolmen and officer to State Trooper served to better align the department with other highway patrol agencies across the country.<br><br>On September 1, 2015, at the direction of Governor Doug Ducey, the department initiated the Arizona Border Strike Force (BSF), a new enforcement initiative that not only targets border crimes but provides a comprehensive collaborative approach to help secure Arizona's international border with Mexico and thwart transnational criminal organizations.<br><br>The initiative requires the department to improve its availability to address border related crimes including: drug trafficking, weapon smuggling, vehicle theft recovery, and violent criminal apprehension, as well as evaluating and analyzing criminal intelligence, and enhancing response capabilities in the border region.<br><br>The BSF utilizes existing infrastructure and partnerships with federal, state, county, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies in the border region. Partnerships among agencies will be leveraged for the purpose of conducting enforcement operations designed to interdict criminal activity in southern and central Arizona.<br><br>One objective of this initiative includes integrating and aligning the intelligence capabilities of partnering agencies.  In addition, the BSF is integrating counter-network operations to identify and target transnational criminal organizations and illicit organizations while prioritizing investigative efforts to deter, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations.<br><br>The BSF is also strengthening international, prosecutorial and deterrent efforts against transnational criminal organizations, and focusing on unified communications and messaging efforts.<br><br>The BSF operations focus on roving criminal interdiction patrol details, intelligence-led remote area operations, outbound details, and deterrent saturation patrols to identify, deter, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations.<br><br>The vehicles of choice for the Arizona DPS/HP are the Ford Crown Victoria with the Police Interceptor package, Ford Explorer, Ford Taurus, and the Chevy Tahoe police package SUV.  The department issued weapons are, for handguns, FN Herstal FNS Long Slide chambered in .40 S&W or 9MM, SIG Sauer P226 chambered in .40 S&W, or the alternative issue SIG Sauer P229 in 40 S&W. For long guns, DPS uses the Patrol rifle 223 caliber Colt AR15A2 Colt M16A2 or Colt M4 supplied with 2, 30 round magazines. The 12 gauge Remington 870 shotguns are not authorized for carry and have been modified for less lethal munitions. SWAT Troopers are issued fully automatic LWRC short barreled rifles.<br><br>The ranks of lieutenant and commander were abolished and converted to captain and major respectively in 2010. On July 24, 2015, officers officially became known as State Troopers.<br><br>The Department of Public Safety is under the command of a director, with the rank of colonel, who is appointed by the Governor of Arizona. The director is assisted by a deputy director, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, appointed by the director. The department is composed of five primary divisions – Highway Patrol, Criminal Investigations, Technical Services, Agency Support and the Director's Office. The four program Divisions are headed by assistant directors, each with the rank of lieutenant colonel.<br><br>Currently, the Arizona Highway Patrol uses Ford Interceptor (SUV and Car), Impala 9C1, Tahoe PPV, Crown Victorias, F-150s, and Expeditions.  They do have one marked Dodge Ram Pickup.  Unmarked vehicles are commonly Impalas, Crown Victorias, F-150 and 250 pickups.  Motorcycle units primarily consist of BMW RT-1200s.<br><br>In the past, automobile manufactures would donate cars to the department for testing.  It would not be unusual to see luxury cars such as Lincoln Town Cars, Ford Thunderbirds, and others.<br><br>The Arizona Highway Patrol is divided into 12 districts:<br><br>The Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Bureau enforces rules and regulations regarding the  operation of commercial vehicles on the roads and highways of Arizona.  The emphasis is on vehicle safety, driver safety, and proper authority and compliance for vehicles operating in commerce.<br><br>The DUI Enforcement Unit investigates drug and alcohol impaired drivers, and provides support to Highway Patrol, local, and county agencies through training and logistical support.<br><br>The Vehicular Crimes and Reconstruction Unit provides investigative expertise and court testimony when a vehicle is connected to a homicide.<br><br>The Criminal Investigations Division provides investigative, enforcement and high risk response support to federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies. The CID conducts investigations regarding narcotic trafficking, organized crime, intelligence, vehicle theft, gangs, computer and financial crimes, as well as major crime investigations when requested by other criminal justice agencies. It operates a geographic information system (GIS) mapping center for the Department of Public Safety and makes data available to other agencies in Arizona.<br><br>The CID is responsible for the protection of the Governor and provides High Risk Response to acts of extraordinary violence and domestic preparedness incidents.<br><br>There are five bureaus within the Criminal Investigations Division:<br><br>The Office of the Director provides assistance to the Arizona Department of Public Safety through administrative services such as crime victim services, management services promoting efficiency of government, media relations, research and planning, legal services, investigation of employee misconduct, internal and external management audits, and coordination of financial and human resource services.<br><br>The Technical Services Division develops and coordinates scientific, technical, regulatory, and support services by providing scientific analysis and criminal justice support to Arizona’s criminal justice agencies. TSD also develops, operates, and maintains the data processing and data/voice communications systems statewide and operates facilities management and logistical support.<br><br>There are six bureaus within the Technical Services Division:<br><br>The Agency Support Division (ASD) exists to support the mission critical units of the Arizona Department of Public Safety.  The Agency Support Division provides support and management services that promote government efficiency, contemporary research and planning, legal services, coordination of financial and human resource services, records and public records services, department training, cost effective facilities management, innovative logistical support, and provides statewide aviation support.<br><br>There are five bureaus within the Agency Support Division:<br><br>Since the establishment of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, 30 troopers and 4 K9s have died while on duty.
