<p><b>Classics</b> or <b>classical studies</b> is the study of classical antiquity</a>. It encompasses the study of the Greco-Roman world</a>, particularly of its languages and literature (Ancient Greek and Classical Latin) but also of Greco-Roman philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the West</a>, the study of the Greek</a> and Roman classics</a> was considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities</a> and a fundamental element of a rounded education. The study of Classics has therefore traditionally been a cornerstone of a typical elite education.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>Classics</i> is derived from the Latin</a> adjective</a> <i>classicus</a></i>, meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens". The word was originally used to describe the members of the highest class in ancient Rome. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-17_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> For example, Aulus Gellius</a>, in his <i>Attic Nights</i>, contrasts "classicus" and "proletarius</a>" writers.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-17_2-1" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Thus the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-17_2-2" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In the Middle Ages</a>, classics and education were tightly intertwined; according to Jan Ziolkowski, there is no era in history in which the link was tighter.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Medieval education taught students to imitate earlier classical models,<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-21_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> and Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and culture, despite the increasing difference between literary Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe during the period.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-21_5-1" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>While Latin was hugely influential, however, Greek was barely studied, and Greek literature survived almost solely in Latin translation.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-22_6-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The works of even major Greek authors such as Hesiod</a>, whose names continued to be known by educated Europeans, were unavailable in the Middle Ages.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-22_6-1" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> In the thirteenth century, the English philosopher Roger Bacon</a> wrote that "there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Along with the unavailability of Greek authors, there were other differences between the classical canon known today and the works valued in the Middle Ages. Catullus</a>, for instance, was almost entirely unknown in the medieval period.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-22_6-2" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The popularity of different authors also waxed and waned throughout the period: Lucretius</a>, popular during the Carolingian</a> period, was barely read in the twelfth century, while for Quintilian</a> the reverse is true.<sup id="cite_ref-Ziolkowski07-22_6-3" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Renaissance">Renaissance</span></h3>
<p>The Renaissance</a> led to the increasing study of both ancient literature and ancient history,<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller78-586_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> as well as a revival of classical styles of Latin.<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller78-587_9-0" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> From the 14th century</a>, first in Italy and then increasingly across Europe, Renaissance Humanism</a>, an intellectual movement that "advocated the study and imitation of classical antiquity",<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller78-586_8-1" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> developed. Humanism saw a reform in education in Europe, introducing a wider range of Latin authors as well as bringing back the study of Greek language and literature to Western Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller78-587_9-1" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> This reintroduction was initiated by Petrarch</a> (1304–1374) and Boccaccio</a> (1313–1375) who commissioned a Calabrian scholar to translate the Homeric poems</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> This humanist educational reform spread from Italy, in Catholic countries as it was adopted by the Jesuits, and in countries that became Protestant such as England, Germany, and the Low Countries, in order to ensure that future clerics were able to study the New Testament in the original language.<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller_1978_590_11-0" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</span></h3>
<p>The late 17th and 18th centuries are the period in Western European literary history which is most associated with the classical tradition, as writers consciously adapted classical models.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaminski_2007_57_12-0" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Classical models were so highly prized that the plays of William Shakespeare</a> were rewritten along neoclassical lines, and these "improved" versions were performed throughout the 18th century.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>From the beginning of the 18th century, the study of Greek became increasingly important relative to that of Latin.<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller_1978_591_14-0" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
In this period Johann Winckelmann</a>'s claims for the superiority of the Greek visual arts influenced a shift in aesthetic judgements, while in the literary sphere, G.E. Lessing</a> "returned Homer to the centre of artistic achievement".<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
In the United Kingdom, the study of Greek in schools began in the late 18th century. The poet Walter Savage Landor</a> claimed to have been one of the first English schoolboys to write in Greek during his time at Rugby School</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19th_century">19th century</span></h3>
<p>The 19th century saw the influence of the classical world, and the value of a classical education, decline,<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> especially in the US, where the subject was often criticised for its elitism.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> By the 19th century, little new literature was still being written in Latin – a practice which had continued as late as the 18th century – and a command of Latin declined in importance.<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller_1978_590_11-1" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Correspondingly, classical education from the 19th century onwards began to increasingly de-emphasise the importance of the ability to write and speak Latin.<sup id="cite_ref-Kristeller_1978_591_14-1" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> In the United Kingdom this process took longer than elsewhere. Composition continued to be the dominant classical skill in England until the 1870s, when new areas within the discipline began to increase in popularity.<sup id="cite_ref-Stray_1996_81_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
In the same decade came the first challenges to the requirement of Greek at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, though it would not be finally abolished for another 50 years.<sup id="cite_ref-Stray_1996_83_20-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Though the influence of classics as the dominant mode of education in Europe and North America was in decline in the 19th century, the discipline was rapidly evolving in the same period.  Classical scholarship was becoming more systematic and scientific, especially with the "new philology" created at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century.<sup id="cite_ref-Rommel_2001_169_21-0" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Its scope was also broadening: it was during the 19th century that ancient history and classical archaeology began to be seen as part of Classics, rather than separate disciplines.<sup id="cite_ref-Stray_1996_81_19-1" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century_to_present">20th century to present</span></h3>
<p>During the 20th century, the study of classics became less common. In England, for instance, Oxford</a> and Cambridge</a> universities stopped requiring students to have qualifications in Greek in 1920,<sup id="cite_ref-Stray_1996_83_20-1" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> and in Latin at the end of the 1950s.<sup id="cite_ref-Stray_1996_85_22-0" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> When the National Curriculum</a> was introduced in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 1988, it did not mention the classics.<sup id="cite_ref-Stray_1996_85_22-1" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> By 2003, only about 10% of state schools in Britain offered any classical subjects to their students at all.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> In 2016, AQA</a>, the largest exam board for A-Levels</a> and GCSE</a>'s in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, announced that it would be scrapping A-Level subjects in Classical Civilization, Archaeology, and Art History.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> This left just one out of five exam boards in England which still offered Classical Civilization as a subject. The decision was immediately denounced by archaeologists and historians, with Natalie Haynes of <i>The Guardian</a></i> stating that the loss of the A-Level would deprive public school students, 93% of all students, the opportunity to study Classics, while making it once again the exclusive purview of wealthy private-school students.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>However, the study of classics has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of <i>Meeting the Challenge</i>, a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition to the teaching of Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> The same can be said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, but not as much as Latin.

<p>Philology is the study of language preserved in written sources; <b>classical philology</b> is thus concerned with understanding any texts from the classical period written in the classical languages of Latin and Greek.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>
The roots of classical philology lie in the Renaissance</a>, as humanist intellectuals attempted to return to the Latin of the classical period, especially of Cicero</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> and as scholars attempted to produce more accurate editions of ancient texts.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
Some of the principles of philology still used today developed during this period. For instance, the observation that if a manuscript could be shown to be a copy of an earlier extant manuscript, then it provides no further evidence of the original text, was made as early as 1489 by Angelo Poliziano</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>
Other philological tools took longer to be developed: the first statement, for instance, of the principle that a more difficult reading should be preferred over a simpler one, was in 1697 by Jean Le Clerc</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The modern discipline of classical philology began in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century.<sup id="cite_ref-Rommel_2001_169_21-1" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> It was during this period that scientific principles of philology began to be put together into a coherent whole,<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> in order to provide a set of rules by which scholars could determine which manuscripts were most accurate.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> This "new philology", as it was known, centred around the construction of a genealogy of manuscripts, with which a hypothetical common ancestor, closer to the original text than any existing manuscript, could be reconstructed.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Art history</a></div>
<p>Some art historians focus their study on the development of art in the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: Doric</a>, Ionic</a>, and Corinthian</a>. The Parthenon</a> is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, Phidias</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_history">Ancient history</span></h3>
<p>With philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, Sparta</a> was a leading Greek city-state</a>, yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from Athens</a>, Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the Roman Empire</a> destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the Etruscans</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy">Philosophy</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Ancient philosophy</a></div>
<p>The English word "philosophy" comes from the Greek word φιλοσοφία, meaning "love of wisdom", probably coined by Pythagoras. Along with the word itself, the discipline of philosophy as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greek thought, and according to Martin West "philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation".<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> Ancient philosophy was traditionally divided into three branches: logic, physics, and ethics.<sup id="cite_ref-Mann_1996_178_44-0" class="reference">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup> However, not all of the works of ancient philosophers fit neatly into one of these three branches. For instance, Aristotle's <i>Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i> have been traditionally classified in the West as "ethics", but in the Arabic world were grouped with logic; in reality, they do not fit neatly into either category.<sup id="cite_ref-Mann_1996_178_44-1" class="reference">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>From the last decade of the eighteenth century, scholars of ancient philosophy began to study the discipline historically.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> Previously, works on ancient philosophy had been unconcerned with chronological sequence and with reconstructing the reasoning of ancient thinkers; with what Wolfgang-Ranier Mann calls "New Philosophy", this changed.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>

<p>A relatively recent new discipline within the classics is "reception studies",<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> which developed in the 1960s at the University of Konstanz</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kallendorf07-02_48-0" class="reference">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>
Reception studies is concerned with how students of classical texts have understood and interpreted them.<sup id="cite_ref-Kallendorf07-02_48-1" class="reference">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>
As such, reception studies is interested in a two-way interaction between reader and text,<sup id="cite_ref-Martindale07-298_49-0" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> taking place within a historical context.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup>

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: Ancient Greek</a>, Mycenaean Greek language</a>, and Koine Greek</a></div>
<p>Ancient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 8th to 6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th to 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC to 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine ("common") or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Literature">Literature</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Ancient Greek literature</a></div>
<p>The earliest surviving works of Greek literature are epic poetry</a>.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>European drama</a> was invented in ancient Greece.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Surviving Greek comedy begins later than tragedy; the earliest surviving work, Aristophanes</a>' <i>Acharnians</a></i>, comes from 425 BC.<sup id="cite_ref-Handley-355_60-0" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> However, comedy dates back as early as 486 BC, when the Dionysia</a> added a competition for comedy to the much earlier competition for tragedy.<sup id="cite_ref-Handley-355_60-1" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> The comedy of the fifth century is known as Old Comedy</a>, and it comes down to us solely in the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, along with a few fragments.<sup id="cite_ref-Handley-355_60-2" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> Sixty years after the end of Aristophanes' career, the next author of comedies to have any substantial body of work survive is Menander</a>, whose style is known as New Comedy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Two historians flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his "History" contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians. The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: Greek mythology</a> and Religion in Ancient Greece</a></div>
<p>Greek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>Greek religion encompassed the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to neighbouring islands.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

<p>The earliest surviving Latin authors, writing in Old Latin, include the playwrights Plautus</a> and Terence</a>. Much of the best known and most highly thought of Latin literature comes from the classical period, with poets such as Virgil</a>, Horace</a>, and Ovid</a>; historians such as Julius Caesar</a> and Tacitus</a>; orators such as Cicero</a>; and philosophers such as Seneca the Younger</a> and Lucretius</a>. Late Latin authors include many Christian writers such as Lactantius</a>, Tertullian</a> and Ambrose</a>; non-Christian authors, such as the historian Ammianus Marcellinus</a>, are also preserved.

<p>The classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the <i>international lingua franca</i> in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into the Romance languages</a> and Ancient Greek into Modern Greek</a> and its dialects</a>. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of Latin</a> and Greek</a> is notable. Ecclesiastical Latin</a>, the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Latin had an impact far beyond the classical world. It continued to be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> The modern Romance languages</a> – such as French, Spanish, and Italian – all derive from Latin.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference">&#91;77&#93;</a></sup> Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference">&#91;78&#93;</a></sup>
