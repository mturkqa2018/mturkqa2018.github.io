<p>Ken Skupski was born in Liverpool. His father, Ken Sr. of Macedonian descent, is a police officer, his motherâs name is Mary. 
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>Skupski is a big fan of Liverpool Football Club and is a keen golfer who plays as often as he can and has a handicap of six.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="University_Tennis_career">University Tennis career</span></h2>
<p>Skupski used to attend Louisiana State University, graduating in May 2007. NCAA Doubles finalist 2005 and Two-time Southeastern Conference Coaches Indoor Champion (only player in the history of the Southeastern Conference to win back-to-back titles). Fourth biggest winning player in the schoolâs history with 107 wins. Six-time All-American (two Singles, one Doubles and three Academic).
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Senior_career">Senior career</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2004">2004</span></h3>
<p>Eight years after he was crowned Wimbledon champion, Richard Krajicek took on Skupski in an exhibition match in Liverpool which was âexhibitionâ in name only. Skupski tied a closely contested clash one set all, then won a Super TieBreak 10-7.

<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2008">2008</span></h3>
<p>Skupski was looking for a fellow British doubles partner who was capable of going to the top of the game. Colin Fleming had turned pro in September and Skupski thought Fleming's game style suited his. Skupski took a bit of a hit because his ranking 250 was much higher than Fleming's at around 900, and so they came to play some low-level Futures and went on a great run.
The pair came to be known as 'Flemski'.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>Fleming/Skupski won three Futures in Glasgow, London, Sunderland

 and the Caversham International Challenger in Jersey.

<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>Ken Skupski finished the year there because he'd had a long year, but Fleming continued by partnering Jonny Marray in the Czech Republic and winning two Futures in  Frydland Nad Ostravici, and Opava
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2009">2009</span></h3>
<p>In June 2009, Skupski and Colin Fleming beat the world no. 1 ranked doubles pair, Mike Bryan and Bob Bryan, at the Queen's Club grass court tournament. However he was out in the first round at Wimbledon for the second year in a row in five sets having led by two sets to love, again he partnered Fleming. He did however make into the second round of the mixed doubles losing in straight sets.
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>In September, the Davis Cup Captain John Lloyd announced that Skupski was part of the Great Britain Davis Cup squad for the Europe/Africa Zone Group 1 relegation play-off against Poland, Skupsi was acting as cover for any injuries and helping the team prepare for Poland's world top-10 ranked doubles team, but didn't play. Great Britain lost 3-2, and were relegated to Group II of the Davis Cup.
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>In September 2009 he won at the Open de Moselle in France. Again partnering Fleming they won 2â6, 6â4, 10â5, against the defending champion, Arnaud ClÃ©ment and MichaÃ«l Llodra. Two months later they won their second title at the St Petersburg Open, defeating another French team of JÃ©rÃ©my Chardy and Richard Gasquet in the final in three sets 2â6, 7â5, 10â4.
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2010">2010</span></h3>
<p>In January 2010, Skupski competed at his first Grand Slam outside of Wimbledon at the Australian Open. Again partnering Fleming they made it into the second before losing in three sets to Michael Kohlmann and Jarkko Nieminen 6â3, 4â6, 3â6. At the French Open he repeated his feat at the Australian open by losing in at the second  in three sets to fourth seeds Wesley Moodie and Dick Norman 6â7, 6â4, 6â7, again he partnered Fleming.
<a name="text16"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></a></p><p>In June, Skupski reached the final of Eastbourne Open but lost in the final to Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski in three sets partnering Colin Fleming.
