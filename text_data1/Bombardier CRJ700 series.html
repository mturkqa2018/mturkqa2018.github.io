<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Development">Development</span></h2>
<p>Following the success of the CRJ100/200 series, Bombardier Aerospace produced larger variants in order to compete with larger regional aircraft such as the Fokker 70/Fokker 100 or the BAe 146 family, and competed later with the Embraer E-Jet family. In 1995, the CRJ-X development was expected to cost C$300 million (US$200 million). By 1999, Bombardier had invested C$650 million (US$440 million) to develop the 70-seat CRJ700, and was to invest C$200 million more to develop the CRJ-900, stretched to 90 seats. The CRJ700 was then priced $24-25 million, and the CRJ900 was to be priced $28-29 million.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>Final assembly of the aircraft is at Montréal-Mirabel International Airport in Mirabel, Quebec, outside Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

<p>In 2007, Bombardier launched the CRJ900 NextGen to replace the initial version. Its improvements and conic nozzle enhances fuel economy by 5.5%. The new model has improved economics and a new cabin common to the CRJ700 NextGen and CRJ1000 NextGen. Mesaba Aviation (now Endeavor Air), operating at the time as Northwest Airlink (now Delta Connection), was the launch customer, and remains the largest operator of the CRJ900 NextGen. The Endeavor fleet of CRJ900 NextGen aircraft are configured in a two class seating configuration, with 12 first class seats and 64 coach seats.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>In 2008, the CRJ700 was replaced with the CRJ700 NextGen, featuring improved economics and a revised cabin common to the CRJ900 NextGen and CRJ1000 NextGen. In January 2011, SkyWest Airlines ordered four CRJ700 NextGen aircraft.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>It accounts for over 20% of all jet departures in North America and globally the family operates more than 200,000 flights per month.
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p><p>In 2016, Bombardier began offering a modernized cabin design for the CRJ Series with a more spacious entry, larger overhead bins, larger windows situated higher in the fuselage, newer seats, larger lavatories, and upgraded lighting.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>Maintenance intervals were extended to 800/8,000 hours. A checks every 800 flight hours and C checks every 8,000 start from summer 2018, and a new conic engine nozzle boosts fuel efficiency by 1%. The 60-100-seat airliner market is forecast by Bombardier for 5,500 from 2018 through 2037.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>Re-engining the CRJ like the Embraer E-Jet E2 with new, more efficient engines like the GE Passport instead of the current GE CF34, would not overcome the certification expense as newer engines are larger and heavier, eroding fuel burn improvements on short regional routes.
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>As of November 2018, following Bombardier's decisions to sell the CSeries to Airbus and the Q Series to Viking Air, the company is looking at "strategic options" to return the CRJ to profitability. Analysts suspect that it may decide to exit the commercial aircraft market altogether and refocus on business aircraft.

<p>Design work on the <i>CRJ700</i> by Bombardier started in 1995 and the programme was officially launched in January 1997. The CRJ700 is a stretched derivative of the CRJ200. The CRJ700 features a new wing with leading edge slats and a stretched and slightly widened fuselage, with a lowered floor. Its first flight took place on 27 May 1999. The aircraft's FAA Type Certificate designation is the <i>CL-600-2C10</i>. The CRJ700 first entered commercial service with Brit Air in 2001.
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>Seating ranges from 63 to 78.  The CRJ700 comes in three versions: Series 700, Series 701, and Series 702. The Series 700 is limited to 68 passengers, the 701 to 70 passengers, and the 702 to 78 passengers. The CRJ700 also has three fuel/weight options: standard, ER, and LR. The ER version has an increase in fuel capacity as well as maximum weight, which in turn increases the range. The LR increases those values further. The executive version is marketed as the <i>Challenger 870</i>.  The CRJ700 directly competes with the Embraer 170, which typically seats 70 passengers.
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>The early build aircraft were equipped with two General Electric CF34-8C1 engines. However, later build aircraft are now equipped standard with the -8C5 model, which is essentially an uprated 8C1. Most airlines have replaced the older engines with the newer model, while a few have kept the older -8C1 in their fleet.
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></a></p><p>Maximum speed is Mach 0.85 (903 km/h; 488 kn) at a maximum altitude of 12,500 m (41,000 ft). Depending upon payload, the CRJ700 has a range of up to 3,620 km (2,250 mi) with original engines, and a new variant with CF34-8C5 engines will have a range of up to 4,660 km (2,900 mi).
<a name="text16"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="CRJ550">CRJ550</span></h4>
<p>On February 6, 2019, Bombardier launched the CRJ550, based on the CRJ700, with 50 seats in three classes. The launch customer, United Airlines, ordered 50 aircraft configured with 10 first class, 20 Economy Plus and 20 economy seats, to be delivered later in 2019. The CRJ550 has a lower MTOW than the CRJ700 in order to comply with scope clauses in US pilot contracts, and is expected to receive type certification in the second half of 2019. The initial 50 aircraft will be sourced from existing CRJ700 airframes, rather than being newly constructed.

<p>The <i>CRJ900</i> is a stretched 76–90 seat version of the CRJ700.  The airplane is loosely based on the CRJ200 series with a few major improvements. The first CRJ900 (C-FRJX) was modified from the prototype CRJ700 by adding longer fuselage plugs fore and aft of the wings. It was later converted into the prototype CRJ1000 by replacing the fuselage plugs with longer plugs.  The CRJ900 competes with the Embraer 175, and is more efficient per seat-mile, according to Bombardier. Mesa Air Group was the launch customer for the CRJ900 painted in America West livery.  The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ900 is the <i>CL-600-2D24</i>.
<a name="text18"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></a></p><p>Comair, operating as Delta Connection, ordered 14 CRJ900s, with at least 6 in service as of November 2007. These are in a two–class configuration, with 12 first class seats and 64 coach seats. This is due to a limitation in Delta's contract with its pilots which limits its regional carriers to flying 76-seat aircraft.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></a></p><p>The wing is wider with added leading edge slats, the tail is redesigned with more span and anhedral.  The cabin floor has been lowered 2 inches which gains outward visibility from the windows in the cabin as the windows become closer to eye level height. Its maximum ground takeoff weight is 84,500 pounds.
<a name="text20"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></a></p><p>The aircraft features two GE CF34-8C5 engines, 59.4 kN (13,400 lbf) thrust with APR. The engines are controlled by FADEC digital engine control instead of control cables and a fuel control unit.
<a name="text21"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></a></p><p>The environmental packs have a target temperature instead of a hot-cold knob. The cabin has a recirculation fan which aids in cooling and heating.  The APU is a Honeywell RE220 unit which supplies much more air to the AC packs and has higher limits for starting and altitude usage.
<a name="text22"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></a></p><p>In typical service the CRJ900 can cruise 8–10,000 ft higher with a slightly higher fuel burn and an average true airspeed of 450–500 knots, a significant improvement over its predecessor.
<a name="text23"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></a></p><p>In 2018, its list price was $48 million, its market value was $24M, most customers are paying $20–22M and the American Airlines order for 15 was at below $20M. A 2012 aircraft was worth less than $14M and it was to fall by 30% in 2021.

<p>The CRJ700 <i>Series 705</i> is based on the CRJ900, with a business class cabin and a reduced maximum seating capacity to allow operation with regional airlines. The Series 705 seats 75 passengers. Some regional airlines have scope clauses with their major airlines that limit the maximum passenger capacity of aircraft they operate. The Air Canada Pilots Association negotiated a scope agreement with Air Canada limiting the maximum seating capacity of any jet aircraft at Air Canada Express to 75 seats. Air Canada Jazz was the launch customer for this aircraft in 2005 with 10 <i>Executive Class</i> and 65 <i>Economy Class</i> seats, all fitted with personal audio/video-on-demand systems. The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ705 is the <i>CL-600-2D15</i>. Jazz Aviation, a subsidiary of Chorus Aviation, operates 16 CRJ705s on behalf of Air Canada and is currently the only operator of this version. On 26 April 2016, Jazz Aviation announced that existing CRJ705 aircraft in operation will be converted to CRJ900 standards.

<p>On 19 February 2007, Bombardier launched the development of the <i>CRJ1000</i>, previously designated CRJ900X, as a stretched CRJ900, with up to 100 seats. The CRJ1000 completed its first production flight on 28 July 2009 in Montreal; the entry into service was planned then for the first quarter of 2010. A month after the first flight, however, a fault in the rudder controls forced the flight-test program to be grounded : the program was not resumed until February 2010, and deliveries were projected to begin by January 2011.
<a name="text26"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></a></p><p>Brit Air and Air Nostrum were the launch customers for the CRJ1000.
<a name="text27"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></a></p><p>Bombardier Aerospace announced on 10 November 2010 that its 100-seat CRJ1000 was awarded Aircraft Type Certificates from Transport Canada and European Aviation Safety Agency, allowing for deliveries to begin. On 14 December 2010, Bombardier began CRJ1000 deliveries to Brit Air and Air Nostrum.
<a name="text28"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></a></p><p>On 23 December 2010, it was announced that the Federal Aviation Administration had also awarded a type certificate, allowing the CRJ1000 to operate in US airspace. Bombardier states that it offers better performance and a higher profit per seat than the competing Embraer E-190.
The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ1000 is the <i>CL-600-2E25</i>.
<a name="text29"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></a></p><p>In 2018, a new CRJ1000 discounted price is $24.8M, a 2015 model is valued $22.0M, a 2010 one is worth $15.5M for a $155,000 monthly lease, and it will be $12.0M in 2021 for a $145,000 monthly lease while its D Check costs $800,000 and its engine overhaul costs $0.9 to 2.4M.
