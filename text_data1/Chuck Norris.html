<p><b>Carlos Ray Norris</b> (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist, actor, film producer and screenwriter.  After serving in the United States Air Force, he competed as a martial artist, won many championships, and he has since founded his own school of fighting, Chun Kuk Do. Norris is  a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Judo.
<a name="text2"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></a></p><p>Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as <i>Way of the Dragon</i> (in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee), <i>Good Guys Wear Black</i>, <i>The Octagon</i>, <i>Lone Wolf McQuade</i>, <i>Code of Silence</i>, <i>The Delta Force,</i> and <i>Missing in Action 1, 2,</i> &amp; <i>3</i>.  He was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He played the title role in the television series <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i> from 1993 until 2001. Since 1997, he and model Christie Brinkley have been the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>Norris has written several books, with subject matter varying from martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christian
religion, western novels, to biography. He was twice a New York Times best-selling author, firstly with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called <i>The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story</i> (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, <i>Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America</i> (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>Originally starting in early 2005 on an internet forum  and later on <i>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</i>,  <i>Chuck Norris facts</i> became an internet meme documenting fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the "facts", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated <i>Chuck Norris facts</i> in advertising, and the phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them <i>New York Times</i> Best Sellers) and two video games.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma on March 10, 1940, to Wilma (née Scarberry, born May 4, 1921) and Ray Norris (1918–1971), who was a World War II Army soldier, a mechanic, bus driver, and truck driver. Norris has stated that he has Irish and Cherokee roots. Norris was named after Carlos Berry, his father's minister. He has two younger brothers, Wieland (1943–1970; killed in Vietnam) and Aaron (a Hollywood producer). When Norris was sixteen, his parents divorced, and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas, and then to Torrance, California, with his mother and brothers.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>Norris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre. His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, and went on alcohol drinking binges that lasted for months at a time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire childhood.

<p>He joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea. It was there that Norris acquired the nickname <i>Chuck</i> and began his training in Tang Soo Do (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the founding of the Chun Kuk Do ("Universal Way") form. When he returned to the United States, he continued to serve as an AP at March Air Force Base in California. Norris was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in August 1962.
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p><p>Following his military service, Norris started to participate in martial arts competitions. He was defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to Joe Lewis and Allen Steen. He lost three matches at the International Karate Championships to Tony Tulleners. By 1967 Norris had improved enough that he scored victories over the likes of Lewis, Skipper Mullins, and Vic Moore.  Norris would be a two-time winner at S. Henry Cho's All American Championship. In early 1968, Norris suffered the tenth and last loss of his career, losing an upset decision to Louis Delgado. On November 24, 1968, he avenged his defeat to Delgado and by doing so won the Professional Middleweight Karate champion title, which he held for six consecutive years. In 1969, he won Karate's triple crown for the most tournament wins of the year, and the Fighter of the Year award by <i>Black Belt</i> magazine.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>Norris also worked for the Northrop Corporation and opened a chain of karate schools including a storefront school in his then-hometown of Torrance, CA on Hawthorne Boulevard. Norris's official website lists celebrity clients at the schools; among them Steve McQueen, Chad McQueen, Bob Barker, Priscilla Presley, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>In 1968, when Norris competed for the World Title, Bruce Lee, who at the time was known for the TV series <i>The Green Hornet</i>, noticed him. They developed a friendship and trained together for the next two years, until Lee returned to Hong Kong to pursue his movie career.

<p>In 1969, Norris made his acting debut in the Dean Martin film <i>The Wrecking Crew.</i>  In 1972, he acted as Bruce Lee's nemesis in the widely acclaimed martial arts movie <i>Way of the Dragon</i> (titled <i>Return of the Dragon</i> in its U.S. distribution). The film grossed HK$5,307,350.50 at the Hong Kong box office, beating previous records set by Lee's own films, <i>The Big Boss</i> and <i>Fist of Fury</i>, making it the highest-grossing film of 1972 in Hong Kong. The film is credited with launching him toward stardom.  In 1973, he had a small role in the comedy <i>The Student Teachers.</i>
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p><p>In 1974, actor Steve McQueen, who was his martial art student and friend at the time, saw his potential and encouraged him to begin acting classes at MGM.
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>That same year, he played the main antagonist in the Lo Wei film <i>Yellow Faced Tiger</i>.  He played the biggest drug king in San Francisco who owns everyone  including the police department. He found his match when a young police officer stood up to him.
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>In 1975, he wrote his first book <i>Winning Tournament Karate</i> on the practical study of competition training for any rank. It covers all phases of executing speedy attacks, conditioning, fighting form drills, and one-step sparring techniques.
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></a></p><p>Norris' first starring role was 1977's <i>Breaker! Breaker!</i>, an action trucking film. After turning down offers to do many martial art films, Norris decided that he wanted to do films that had story and where the action would take place when it is emotionally right. The low budget film turned out to be very successful.
<a name="text16"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></a></p><p>In 1978, Norris starred in the thriller, <i>Good Guys Wear Black</i>, that he considers to be his first significant lead role. No studio wanted to release it, so Norris and his producers four-walled it, renting the theaters and taking whatever money came in. The film did very well; shot on a $1 million budget, it made over $18 million at the box office.
<a name="text17"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></a></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1979_to_1983:_Action_film_star">1979 to 1983: Action film star</span></h3>
<p>In 1979, Norris starred in <i>A Force of One</i>, where he played Matt Logan, a world karate champion who assists the police in their investigation. The film was developed while touring for <i>Good Guys Wear Black</i>. Again no studio wanted to pick it up, but it out-grossed the previous film by making $20 million at the box office.
<a name="text18"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></a></p><p>In 1980, he released <i>The Octagon</i>, where his character must stop a group of terrorists trained in the ninja style. Unlike his previous films this time the studios were interested. American Cinema Releasing distributed it and it made almost $19 million at the box office.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></a></p><p>In 1981, he starred in Steve Carver's <i>An Eye for an Eye,</i> co-starring Christopher Lee, Richard Roundtree, Matt Clark, and Mako Iwamatsu.
<a name="text20"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></a></p><p>The following year he had the lead in the action horror film <i>Silent Rage</i> (1982) it was his first film released by a major studio Columbia Pictures. In the film Norris is a sheriff who must stop a mentally ill man who goes on a rampage after being granted near-indestructibility in a medical experiment.
<a name="text21"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></a></p><p>Shortly afterward MGM gave him a three-movie deal, and that same year they released <i>Forced Vengeance</i> (1982). Norris was unhappy with the direction they wanted to take with him, hence the contract was cancelled.
<a name="text22"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></a></p><p>In 1983, Norris made <i>Lone Wolf McQuade</i> with Orion Pictures. He played J.J. McQuade, a reckless Texas Ranger who'd rather work alone, but who gets a new partner because his captain would like to have him supervised. The partners investigate an arms dealer played by David Carradine. The film was a worldwide hit and had a positive reception from movie critics, often being compared to Sergio Leone's stylish spaghetti westerns. The film became the inspiration for Norris's future hit TV show <i>Walker, Texas Ranger.</i> Film critic Roger Ebert  gave the film a 3.5 star rating, calling the character of J.J. McQuade worthy of a film series and predicting the character would be a future classic.
<a name="text23"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></a></p><p>The same year, he also published his second book about general exercising called <i>Toughen Up! the Chuck Norris Fitness System</i>.
<a name="text24"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></a></p><p>Also in 1983, Xonox produced the video game <i>Chuck Norris Superkicks</i> for the Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision. The game combines two types of gameplay: moving through a map, and fighting against enemies. The player takes control of Chuck Norris who has to liberate a hostage. It was later sold as <i>Kung Fu Superkicks</i> when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired.
<a name="text25"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1984_to_1988:_Mainstream_success">1984 to 1988: Mainstream success</span></h3>
<p>In 1984, Norris starred in <i>Missing in Action</i>, the first of a series of POW rescue fantasies themed around the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue that were produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and released under their Cannon Films banner, with which he had signed a multiple movie deal. He plays Colonel James Braddock, a US military officer who spent seven years in a North Vietnamese POW camp, which he escaped 10 years ago. After the war, Braddock accompanies a government investigation team that travels to Ho Chi Minh City to investigate reports of US soldiers still held prisoner. Norris later dedicated these films to his younger brother Wieland, who was a private in the 101st Airborne Division, and had been killed in June 1970 in Vietnam while on patrol in the defense of Firebase Ripcord. The film was a huge success and Norris became Cannon's most prominent star of the 1980s.

<p><span id="Chun_Kuk_Do"></span>
Chun Kuk Do was founded by Chuck Norris, and was originally based on Norris' Tang Soo Do training in Korea while he was in the military. During his competitive fighting career, Norris began to evolve the style to make it more effective and well-rounded by studying other systems such as Shotokan karate, Goju-ryu karate, Shito-ryu karate, American kenpo, Enshinkaikan, Kyokushinkai, Judo, Brazilian Juijutsu, Arnis, Korean Tae Kwon Do, Tang Soo Do and Hapkido. Chun Kuk Do now emphasizes self defense, competition, weapons, grappling, and fitness, among other things.  Each summer the United Fighting Arts Federation (UFAF) holds a training conference and the Chun Kuk Do world championship tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada.
<a name="text75"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">75</span></a></p><p>Chun Kuk Do includes a code of honor and rules to live by. These rules are from Norris' personal code. They are:
<a name="text76"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></a></p>
<ol><li>I will develop myself to the maximum of my potential in all ways.</li>
<li>I will forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements.</li>
<li>I will continually work at developing love, happiness and loyalty in my family.</li>
<li>I will look for the good in all people and make them feel worthwhile.</li>
<li>If I have nothing good to say about a person, I will say nothing.</li>
<li>I will always be as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.</li>
<li>I will maintain an attitude of open-mindedness.</li>
<li>I will maintain respect for those in authority and demonstrate this respect at all times.</li>
<li>I will always remain loyal to my God, my country, family and my friends.</li>
<li>I will remain highly goal-oriented throughout my life because that positive attitude helps my family, my country and myself.</li></ol>

<p>Norris is a Republican, and has donated more than $32,000 to Republican candidates and organizations since 1988.
<a name="text105"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">105</span></a></p><p>On November 18, 2008, Norris became one of the first members of show business to express support for the California Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage, and he chided activists for "interfering" with the democratic process and the double standard he perceived in criticizing the LDS Church without criticizing African Americans, who had voted for the measure by a wide margin.
<a name="text106"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">106</span></a></p><p>During the 2012 presidential election, Norris first recommended Ron Paul, and then later formally endorsed Newt Gingrich as the Republican presidential candidate. After Gingrich suspended his campaign in May 2012, Norris endorsed Republican presumptive nominee Mitt Romney, despite Norris having previously accused Romney of flip-flopping and of trying to buy the nomination for the Republican Party candidacy for 2012. On the eve of the election he and his wife Gena made a video warning that if evangelicals didn't show up at the polls and vote out President Obama, "...our country as we know it may be lost forever...". Norris also produced the film <i>Answering the Call</i>, which featured his 2007 trip to Iraq to visit the troops.
<a name="text107"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">107</span></a></p><p>Norris has visited Israel and voiced support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the 2013 and 2015 elections. Norris endorsed Huckabee again in the 2016 Republican Primary before he dropped out. In March 2016, it was reported that Norris endorsed Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz and that he would be attending a Cruz rally, but two days later, Norris stated he would only endorse the GOP nominee once that nominee has been nominated by the party. He endorsed GOP nominee Donald Trump in the general election. Norris endorsed former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philanthropy">Philanthropy</span></h2>
<p>In 1990, Norris established the United Fighting Arts Federation and Kickstart Kids. As a significant part of his philanthropic contributions, the organization was formed to develop self-esteem and focus in at-risk children as a tactic to keep them away from drug-related pressure by training them in martial arts. Norris hopes that by shifting middle school and high school children's focus towards this positive and strengthening endeavour, these children will have the opportunity to build a better future for themselves.  Norris has a ranch in Navasota, TX where they bottle water; a portion of the sales support environmental funds and Kickstart Kids.
<a name="text109"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">109</span></a></p><p>He is known for his contributions towards organizations such as Funds for Kids, Veteran's Administration National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, the United Way, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the form of donations as well as fund-raising activities.
<a name="text110"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">110</span></a></p><p>His time with the U.S. Veterans Administration as a spokesperson was inspired by his experience serving the United States Air Force in Korea. His objective has been to popularize the issues that concern hospitalized war veterans such as pensions and health care. Due to his significant contributions, and continued support, he received the <i>Veteran of the Year</i> award in 2001 at the <i>American Veteran Awards</i>.
<a name="text111"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">111</span></a></p><p>In India, Norris supports the Vijay Amritraj Foundation, which aims at bringing hope, help and healing to the defenceless and innocent victims of disease, tragedy and circumstance. Through his donations, he has helped the foundation support Paediatric HIV/AIDS homes in Delhi, a blind school in Karnataka, and a mission that cares for HIV/AIDS infected adults, as well as mentally ill patients in Cochin.
