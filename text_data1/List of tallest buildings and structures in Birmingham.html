<p>High-rise development in Birmingham was most active during the post-war development phase of the 1960s when many box-shaped, concrete towers were constructed; this included many tower blocks housing flats. These towers are now either being demolished or renovated; for instance, The Rotunda on New Street has undergone a dramatic makeover.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>High-rise development slowed during the 1980s and early 1990s, but is increasing again with the completion of 10 Holloway Circus and the Orion Building and many proposed projects in development areas such as the Eastside. Many of these new high-rises contain residential properties, which are promoting city living. The Snowhill development will also dramatically increase the office space available in the city centre; Birmingham hopes to capitalise on its recent good fortunes of attracting overseas investment. The planned High Speed 2 railway linking London to Birmingham and beyond will be an additional marketing tool that Birmingham will hope to capitalise on. There are three buildings that have been approved for construction which are taller than 10 Holloway Circus, which is currently the tallest habitable building in Birmingham.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>In recent years, Birmingham City Council has relaxed its attitude towards tall skyscrapers. However, some restrictions remain. The city centre is located on a 361 ft (110m) sandstone ridge and as a result, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has imposed a maximum building height limit at 794 ft (242m). Prospects of building between 427 ft (130m) to 574 ft (175m) would normally require consultation with Birmingham Airport. Skyscraper proposals with heights between 574 ft (175m) to 794 ft (242m) would require consultation with the CAA. It is not known why these restrictions are in place, considering the fact that the city centre is not on the approach path to the airport.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>There are currently two skyscrapers with a height of 100 metres (328 ft) or more, and 191 high-rise buildings with a height of at least 35 metres (115 ft) or more.

<p>This list ranks externally complete Birmingham buildings and free-standing structures that stand more than 50 metres (164 ft) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. An equals sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The "Year" column indicates the year in which a building was completed. Buildings that have been demolished are not included.

The plan called for a landmark 50-storey tower of around 245 metres (805 feet) in height, always intended to be built as one of the latter phases of the scheme. In the aftermath of the World Trade Center attack and after considering market forces, the developers removed 15-storeys from the planned tower.</li>

<p>In the place of the Rotunda was to stand a 160 metre tall office block, a Post Modern design with Art Deco hints of a similar manner to One Liberty Place in Philadelphia. The recession at the start of the 1990s however saw the plans fail to come to fruition and the Rotunda was later listed and restored.
