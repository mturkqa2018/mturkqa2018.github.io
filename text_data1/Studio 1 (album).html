<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>In February 2001, All Saints announced that they were to take a break so that they "could clear the air between themselves". Melanie Blatt said later that year that it was uncertain if they would reform, citing their difficulties with the financial and business aspects of the group. Shaznay Lewis later explained that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: "I would never in a million years have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident. But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over. And the way I was then, the state we'd got into then, there was no way she was getting that stupid jacket." In November 2001, London Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled <i>All Hits</i>. The album peaked at number eighteen on the UK Albums Chart and was later certified gold, selling 100,000 copies.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>On 24 January 2006, it was announced that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. Lewis answered why they were back together, saying: "Because this time round we just want to have a good time and a laugh". While Nicole Appleton stated: "We weren't finished, I think this album is the best we've done." Blatt remarked: "I didn't know what to expect. Would it be the same? Would it be worse? But it was actually better, because we've all grown up."
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>Blatt discussed the reunion in an interview with <i>i-D</i> magazine in 2012: "I don't think it was done for the right reasons... I know that I did it for the money. We got signed before we had even made music again, it wasn't like we felt we had something to give back to the world... we were given an opportunity and took it, without really thinking about it too hard". She also said she never felt comfortable with the success the band had and that "it was not necessarily the plan at the beginning; there was a lot of compromise involved". She later stated in 2016 with the same publication: "Because you know what, we got signed [to Parlophone] having not made one piece of music. They signed the idea of us getting back together. I felt fraudulent from that moment on and it didn't feel like a real thing".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h2>
<p><i>Studio 1</i> bears the All Saints' signature sound, a blend of pop, hip hop, R&amp;B and a bit of rock. The first track and lead single "Rock Steady" was the first-ever song Shaznay Lewis wrote with Greg Kurstin and the first demo the band sang together in four years. The second track and second single "Chick Fit" was described as "one of those blast it, getting ready, dance around tracks" and one of Nicole's favourites on the album. "On and On" was written when member Shaznay was pregnant and got the anticipation of going through the whole thing. For Melanie Blatt, "It's the most old All Saints sounding one from the William Orbit days." "Scar" opens with a horn section and then goes off into a bit of a ska direction. It was called "Scar" purely because of the ska influence in the song but someone wrote it scar and it stayed. According to Nicole Appleton, "Not Eazy" was inspired by bands like Madness and No Doubt who have a "trumpet reggae sound." It is about relationships and things women can relate to. "Hell No" was penned by Shaznay Lewis and Karl "K-Gee" Gordon. "Tell me who's that bitch I see climbing out your window", they sing. According to Lewis, "It's a totally made-up song about trusting a man. I've checked a few text messages in the past!"
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>Lewis said of "One Me and U": "That's one of my favourites. I love the whole Burt Bacharach feel. It's quite Sixties". Opening with a hard piano riff and propelled along by some heavy percussion, "Headlock" is a song about unreliable men. Lewis commented: "I've not just drawn from myself, but from someone in the band and friends." "Too Nasty" shows indignation on a wayward reggae. It was called "Tuna Steak" because Blatt's daughter Lily came into the studio and when they sang "too nasty", she thought they were singing "tuna steak". The lyrics speak of a former boyfriend with a "dirty" habit that the singer witnessed and cannot forget. Blatt, who co-wrote the song, told <i>The Sun</i>: "In my head this song was about bestiality. So basically it's someone getting it on with a horse, sheep, chicken." Lewis revealed that Greg Wells is very into harmonies and weird, quirky sounds, which she was also into, so they worked well together on the tenth track "In It to Win It". "Flashback" was written by Natalie Appleton and Amanda Ghost. According to herself, she "has a tendency to say things and think, 'Oh, I wish I'd never said that.' So, she was trying to put that down." The album closes with "Fundamental", which, according to Lewis, "is a love song for all four of us and our kids."

<p><i>Studio 1</i> received mixed reviews from music critics. Caroline Sullivan from <i>The Guardian</i> gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing: "<i>Studio 1</i> offers a fresh take on their girl-group style. Always R&amp;B-inclined, their harmonies are now judiciously seasoned with reggae and ska." John Murphy from musicOMH gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, commenting: "<i>Studio 1</i>, despite not bearing much resemblance to the All Saints of yore, will be snapped up eagerly by those who remember them fondly in their heyday. Yet it's unclear who else this will appeal to really – while it's a pleasant enough listen for the most part, there aren't enough strong songs for it to really grab the attention." Matthew Chisling from AllMusic wrote that "Unfortunately, while all the music is appealing, it lacks personality and character. The tracks, all composed by Shaznay Lewis and Greg Kurstin, bear no emotional value, and the girls' voices are indistinguishable from one another and digitally enhanced to the point of obscurity."
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>In a more mixed review, Kitty Empire from <i>The Observer</i> perceived that "despite some flickers of interest – on 'Chick Fit' and 'Hell No' in particular – too much of <i>Studio 1</i> happens in a thin, tinny place." Hamish Champ gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, writing that "the album sounds like an attempt to show that while they may be mums now they can still strut their funky stuff. It works, more or less, but the nagging feeling remains that others have entered the musical arena in the intervening years and have stolen the girls' pop tiaras."

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Commercial_performance">Commercial performance</span></h2>
<p>During the week of the album's release, it faced a chart battle against George Michael's <i>Twenty Five</i> and the Sugababes' <i>Overloaded: The Singles Collection</i>. Although the media predicted sales would be "very close", <i>Studio 1</i> entered the UK Albums Chart at number 40, falling significantly short of the success of "Rock Steady" and the group's previous releases. Despite its lack of chart success, the album has shipped over 100,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified Gold. As of April 2016, however, it has sold only 40,054 copies.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Promotion">Promotion</span></h2>
<p>To promote <i>Studio 1</i>, All Saints performed "Rock Steady" live on Ant &amp; Dec's <i>Saturday Night Takeaway</i>, on 21 October 2006. This was the first time the group performed live together in five years since their split in 2001. On 25 October 2006, All Saints performed the single live in a setlist of six songs, five from <i>Studio 1</i> and signature hit single "Pure Shores" at the Sheperd's Bush Pavilion in London. The group wore black or white-coloured shirts teamed with big, loose-knotted ties. Before the show, Shaznay Lewis addressed the crowd saying "We're very nervous, you know" and Nicole Appleton said that she was "emotional" after the gig. Chris Elwell-Sutton of the <i>Evening Standard</i> reviewed the performance saying:
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p>
<blockquote><p>All Saints are back in the groove. [...] All Saints did a good job showcasing some strong new material. [...] Forthcoming single 'Rock Steady' was another energetic, commercially viable highlight. They looked tired at times, especially Mel Blatt, who perspired heavily under the lights, and while their routines were competent, serious questions have to be asked about their live skills, with accusations of miming rumbling frequently around the room. Luckily for All Saints, this didn't feel like a symptom of decline, having always employed minimal physical effort, simple choreography, and heavily produced vocals. All Saints are not natural live performers, but against the odds, last night's showing provided some optimism about their comeback potential.<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Eva Simpson and Caroline Hedley of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> said that the group "put on one hell of a show." James McNair of <i>The Independent</i> gave the gig a five star rating, saying: "The superb new single 'Rock Steady' shifts things up a gear, All Saints nailing their dancehall influences to the mast and engaging in some neat, microphone-swapping choreography. [...] Watch out, Pussycat Dolls."
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>The single was then performed live on <i>Popworld</i> on 4 November as part of its promotion leading up to its release on 6 November. On 14 November, they appeared on <i>Top of the Pops</i> for a performance of the single. The girls also showed up at BBC's <i>Children in Need</i> on 17 November to perform the single. All Saints performed the song live as the opening act on <i>The Chart Show</i> on 18 November 2006, alongside acts like Girls Aloud and McFly. The group also performed "Pure Shores" at the event and the following was said about their performances: "They didn't disappoint [...] the party was now well under way." All Saints also performed several tracks on Channel 4's <i>T4</i>, aired on the same day. They also planned a tour to promote the album; however, it did not come to fruition.
