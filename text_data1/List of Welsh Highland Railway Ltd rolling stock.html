<td>'The Buffet Car' This carriage was initially given the number "23" in the combined FR/WHR stock list.  However, there is documentary evidence that the carriage was formally identified as "No. 24" in 1936.  It appears that this number change occurred in 1926 when the WHR exchanged one of their Ashbury "Summer" carriages (No 24) with the FR in return for three bogie coal wagons.
<p>The carriage was modified by the WHR in 1927 to serve as a buffet car, a service which operated until 1929.  It was recovered in 1987 and restored by Stanegate Restorations and Replicas Ltd and WHHR ltd with its first run in the heritage train on 2 May 2009.
