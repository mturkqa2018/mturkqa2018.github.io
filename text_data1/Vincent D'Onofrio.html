<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>D'Onofrio was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He is of Italian descent, with ancestors from Sicily. His parents, Gennaro and Phyllis D'Onofrio, an interior designer/theater-production assistant, and server, respectively, met while Gennaro was stationed in Hawaii with the U.S. Air Force. In 1956, they had their first child, Antoinette. Their second child, Elizabeth (born 1957), is an actress and drama coach residing in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, and then Vincent was born, the youngest of the three siblings. He was raised in Hawaii and Colorado during his early years.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>D'Onofrio's parents divorced when he was young; his mother later married George Meyer. He became step-brother to Meyer's children from a previous marriage (Guy and Connie). The family moved to the Hialeah, Florida area. D'Onofrio described himself as a shy boy who spent "a lot of time in my room, staying in my head", later became interested in magic and sleight of hand, tricks he learned from Cuban entertainers who owned a small magic shop.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>In his teens, he worked backstage in set building and sound production at a number of community theaters run by his father. He graduated from Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acting_and_filmmaking">Acting and filmmaking</span></h3>
<p>After graduating from high school, D'Onofrio started to appear on stage. During an 18-month stint at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, he was involved with small, community-theater productions. He later studied method acting at the American Stanislavsky Theater and the Actors Studio, under coaches Sonia Moore and Sharon Chatten, which landed him his first paid role in off-Broadway's <i>This Property Is Condemned</i>. He went on to appear in a number of their productions, including <i>Of Mice and Men</i> and <i>Sexual Perversity in Chicago</i>. D'Onofrio continued his career by performing in many New York University student productions while also working as a bouncer at the Hard Rock Cafe, a bodyguard for Robert Plant and Yul Brynner and a deliveryman. 
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>In 1984, he made his Broadway debut as Nick Rizzoli in <i>Open Admissions</i>. In 2012, D'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute where his daughter is a student.
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p><p>In 1986, D'Onofrio took on the role often considered the defining moment in his acting career, as Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, an overweight, clumsy Marine recruit in the movie <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>. On a tip from friend Matthew Modine, D'Onofrio was urged to send audition tapes to director Stanley Kubrick, in England. Four tapes later, D'Onofrio landed the role. Originally, the character of Pvt. Lawrence had been written as a "skinny ignorant redneck"; however, Kubrick believed the role would have more impact if the character were big and clumsy. D'Onofrio gained 70 lb (32 kg) for the role, bringing his weight to 280 lb (130 kg). This remains the record for most weight gained by an actor for a film. While filming an obstacle course scene for the movie, D'Onofrio injured his left knee, compounded by the excessive weight, which required surgical reconstruction.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>After filming of <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> was completed, having lost nearly all the weight gained for the movie in nine months, D'Onofrio went on to play Dawson, the owner of Dawson's Garage in <i>Adventures in Babysitting</i> (1987). He appears in one scene near the end of the film. In 1988, he was cast in another supporting role in the film <i>Mystic Pizza</i>, playing the fiancé of Lili Taylor's character. In the film, which was Julia Roberts' breakout film, he was billed under his full name Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>D'Onofrio continued to play a wide variety of minor or supporting roles, including the father of a saint in Nancy Savoca's <i>Household Saints</i> (1993), director Orson Welles in Tim Burton's <i>Ed Wood</i> (1994), farmer Edgar and the evil "Bug" that possesses him from <i>Men in Black</i> (1997), a man who claims to be from the future in <i>Happy Accidents</i> (2000), and the serial killer Carl Stargher, opposite Jennifer Lopez's character in <i>The Cell</i> (2000).
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>In 1992, he appeared in Robert Altman's <i>The Player</i>, as an aspiring screenwriter. In 1997, he made a move to television and received an Emmy nomination for his appearance as John Lange in the <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i> episode "Subway". In 1999, he turned down a role in <i>The Sopranos</i>. D'Onofrio portrayed leftist radical Abbie Hoffman in <i>Steal This Movie</i> in 2000, starring Janeane Garofalo as his wife.
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p><p>In 2001, he took on what became his longest and perhaps best-known role as Det. Robert Goren on the NBC/USA Network television show <i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</i>. On March 1, 2008, D'Onofrio made a cameo appearance in a presidential election-related sketch in a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> episode as his character Det. Robert Goren. In the sketch, he interrogates Hillary Clinton (played by Amy Poehler). His entrance to and exit from the skit are punctuated by the <i>Law &amp; Order</i> "dun-DUN" sound. 
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>In 2009, it was announced that D'Onofrio would be leaving <i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</i> in the spring of 2010, with his last appearance occurring in the two-part, season-9 premiere. He was replaced by Jeff Goldblum, but after a drop in ratings, D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe agreed to return for a 10th (and final) season of the show.
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>In 2003, it was reported that D'Onofrio and Joe Pantoliano had begun work on a small film titled <i>Little Victories</i>, about a 12-year-old boy whose perceptions of the world are forever changed when his gangster uncle comes to live with him. According to a television interview with Pantoliano, the film was not completed and went into turnaround due to a failure to raise the funds necessary for production.
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></a></p><p>In November 2005, D'Onofrio won Best Actor at the Stockholm International Film Festival for his role as Mike Cobb in the independent film <i>Thumbsucker</i>. In 2006, he appeared in <i>The Break-Up</i>, starring Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, playing Vaughn's eccentric brother.  Vaughn and he had appeared together in two previous films, <i>The Cell</i> (2000), wherein Vaughn played an FBI agent pursuing D'Onofrio's character, and <i>Thumbsucker</i> (2005). He appears in the Oscar-winning short "The New Tenants" (2009).
<a name="text16"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></a></p><p>Over the next few years, D'Onofrio co-starred in films such as: <i>Staten Island</i> (2009), <i>Brooklyn's Finest</i> (2010), <i>Kill the Irishman</i> (2011), <i>Crackers</i> (2011), <i>American Falls</i> (2012), <i>Fire with Fire</i> (2012), and <i>Ass Backwards</i> (2013).
<a name="text17"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></a></p><p>In 2011, he began work on the Jennifer Lynch 2012 film <i>Chained</i> (previously titled <i>Rabbit</i>) in which he portrays Bob, a serial killer who kidnaps a young boy, Rabbit, and makes him his protégé. When he becomes older, Rabbit must decide whether to follow in the footsteps of his captor or plan his escape. The film shot in areas in and around Regina and Moose Jaw, both in Saskatchewan.
<a name="text18"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></a></p><p>On May 1, 2012, due to "explicit violence", the movie was given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA, despite an appeal by Jennifer Lynch, and the distributor, with scenes cut to maximize theater exposure and distribution. No stranger to the NC-17 ratings, Lynch, who responded to the ruling a day later also saw cuts made to her film <i>Boxing Helena</i>. In July 2012, a press release from Anchor Bay announced that the film would be released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 2, 2012 and would include the deleted scene, involving a throat being cut, which caused the NC-17 rating.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></a></p><p>On September 14, 2011, it was announced that D'Onofrio would star alongside Ethan Hawke in a new NBC show, <i>Blue Tilt</i>, named after the harmful psychological effects homicide detectives experience after constantly dealing with horrific crimes.
<a name="text20"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></a></p><p>D'Onofrio and Hawke had worked together in the films <i>The Newton Boys</i>, <i>Staten Island</i>, <i>Brooklyn's Finest</i> and <i>Sinister</i>. The hour-long cop drama, in which D'Onofrio would play Sonny, was to follow the main characters' attempts to balance their careers with family life. Writer Chris Brancato, fresh from Season 10 of <i>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</i>, was brought on board to pen the episodes. Filming of the pilot episode was set to start in February 2012. On March 27, 2012, a tweet from Kevin Dunigan, the co-creator and developer of the pilot, revealed that NBC had shelved the project because it did not have enough "pop to attract viewers".
<a name="text21"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></a></p><p>On April 30, 2012, the short film <i>Crackers</i>, starring D'Onofrio as Gus, won a People's Choice Award at the Fort Myers Beach Film Festival. The festival, which had been dormant for six years, was rekindled and partly organized by Vincent's sister, actress Elizabeth D'Onofrio.
<a name="text22"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></a></p><p>Fresh from his role in Jennifer Lynch's <i>Chained</i>, it was announced on August 11, 2012, that D'Onofrio would star in her upcoming film <i>A Fall From Grace</i>. The film tells the story of Detective Michael Tabb, to be played by Tim Roth, as he investigates the murders of young girls burned and washing ashore along the Mississippi River. A further upcoming Lynch project, <i>The Monster Next Door</i>, was set to also star D'Onofrio.
<a name="text23"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></a></p><p>Also in November, filming began on the Vidhu Vinod Chopra movie, <i>Broken Horses</i>, which focused on gang warfare around the border between the United States and Mexico. D'Onofrio starred alongside Chris Marquette and Anton Yelchin.
<a name="text24"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></a></p><p>In 2013, D'Onofrio co-starred in the film <i>Escape Plan</i>, filmed in New Orleans, also starring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 50 Cent. D'Onofrio portrayed Lester Clark, deputy director of the Prisons Bureau.
<a name="text25"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></a></p><p>D'Onofrio co-starred in the film drama <i>The Judge</i> (2014).
<a name="text26"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></a></p><p>His other projects included a role in <i>Supreme Ruler</i> with Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Bogosian's <i>Mall</i> which he co-wrote with his former <i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</i> co-star, and <i>Pawn Shop Chronicles</i>.
<a name="text27"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></a></p><p>In 2015, D'Onofrio made his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut as Wilson Fisk in the first season of <i>Daredevil</i>. He reprised the role in an extended cameo appearance in season 2, and in season 3 as a series regular.

<p>D'Onofrio has also had success behind the camera, producing <i>The Whole Wide World</i> in which he also starred in. (1996) and <i>Guy</i> (1997), and  executive producing <i>The Velocity of Gary</i> (1998) and <i>Steal This Movie!</i> (2000). In 2005, he directed and starred in the short film <i>Five Minutes, Mr. Welles</i> (2005), which represented a culmination of D'Onofrio's desire to improve on his performance as Welles in <i>Ed Wood</i>, which reportedly left director Tim Burton underwhelmed. Burton decided to procure the services of voiceover artist Maurice LaMarche due to being known for his imitation of Welles' voice to produce a more dramatically effective rendering of the character's dialogue. Disappointed with his performance, having been given two weeks notice to prepare for the role, D'Onofrio wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the short in answer to the critics and himself. The film depicts D'Onofrio as Welles preparing for his role in <i>The Third Man</i>.
<a name="text29"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></a></p><p>In 2008, he returned to directing with the feature-length musical slasher <i>Don't Go in the Woods</i> (2010), written by his friend Joe Vinciguerra, featuring a score by Sam Bisbee, and starring various unknown actors hand-picked by D'Onofrio. It follows an indie rock band who venture into the woods to write new music, only to meet a crazed murderer (Tim Lajcik). The film, shot in 13 days near Kingston, New York, had a budget of $100,000 and played at numerous festivals throughout 2009 and 2010. Initially slated for national release in December 2011, the film opened to limited theaters on January 13, 2012,  and was released on DVD on June 12, 2012. His next project is directing and starring in the 2019 western <i>The Kid</i>.
