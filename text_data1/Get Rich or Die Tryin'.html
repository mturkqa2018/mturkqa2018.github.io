<p><i><b>Get Rich or Die Tryin<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span></b></i> is the debut studio album by American rapper 50 Cent. It was released on February 6, 2003, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Prior to the album, 50 Cent released several mixtapes alongside the Trackmasters on an unreleased album widely believed to be his debut in 2000. However, after suffering legal troubles and being blackballed from the music industry, 50 Cent found difficulty in securing another major-label recording contract, until he signed with Eminem's Shady Records in 2002. 
<a name="text2"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></a></p><p>After signing with Eminem, he also worked heavily with Dr. Dre, with the duo acting as the album's executive producers, who worked to combine the gangsta rap and R&amp;B combo prevalent in New York hip hop. Additional production is provided by Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL, Mr. Porter, Rockwilder, Dirty Swift, and Megahertz. The album also contains guest appearances from Eminem, Young Buck, and Nate Dogg, as well as features from G-Unit co-members Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>Released a week in advance to combat bootlegging and internet leakage, <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i> debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling over 872,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album's singles also saw commercial success, with both "In da Club" and "21 Questions" reaching number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, while "P.I.M.P." became a number one hit in several countries. The album would eventually sell over 8 million copies in the United States, and has become certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also saw widespread critical success, becoming nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. It was ranked by <i>Rolling Stone</i> as one of the best albums of the 2000s.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>Prior to the release of his mix-tape, 50 Cent was shot nine times in Queens, New York on May 24, 2000. He managed to survive, but was dropped from his label, Columbia Records, and remained unsigned and in need of producing new music. In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of 50 Cent's <i>Guess Who's Back?</i> mix-tape album through Jackson's attorney, who was working with Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg. After being impressed with the mixtape, Eminem invited 50 Cent to Los Angeles where he was introduced to producer Dr. Dre. 50 Cent signed a one million dollar record deal with Dr. Dre and released his next mixtape, <i>No Mercy, No Fear</i>. It featured the <i>8 Mile</i> single, "Wanksta", which was later put on <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span></i>. Both Eminem and Dr. Dre had started working-productions on his debut album with additional help from producers Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL among others.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>The first single "In da Club" was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. Eminem was featured on a couple songs, such as "Patiently Waiting" and "Don't Push Me". His songs also featured rappers within G-Unit, such as Lloyd Banks ("Don't Push Me"), Tony Yayo ("Like My Style"), or Young Buck ("Blood Hound"). The next single "21 Questions" was not in line to be on the album to Dr. Dre, he stated that he did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, "Dre was, like, 'How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'" 50 Cent responded saying, "I'm two people. I've always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that's not diversity, it's necessity." "Back Down" was an instrumental originally composed by Dr. Dre. It was originally intended to be used on Rakim's debut Aftermath album, <i>Oh My God,</i> but due to creative differences was not released. Early pressings of <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span></i> included a limited edition bonus DVD. A music video for "Many Men (Wish Death)" was made. The song was also certified Gold by the RIAA on  June 14, 2006.

<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>Its second single, "21 Questions", became 50 Cent's second chart topper on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, where it remained for four non-consecutive weeks. It spent seven weeks on top of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Outside the States, "21 Questions" reached number six in the United Kingdom. It was certified gold by the RIAA.

<p><i>Get Rich or Die Tryin<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span></i> received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, it holds an aggregate score of 73 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>In his review for <i>USA Today</i>, Steve Jones believed that the album is worthy of the hype 50 Cent had attracted because of how he "delivers, in vivid detail, stories of the violent life he led as a crack dealer and speaks with the swagger of one who has been shot nine times and lived to tell about it." AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier described it as "impressive" and "incredibly calculated", and identified it as "ushering in 50 as one of the truly eminent rappers of his era". <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's Christian Hoard praised the album's production and 50 Cent's "thug persona" and rapping ability. Brett Berliner of <i>Stylus Magazine</i> felt that he is versatile as a rapper and wrote that, "while not even close to perfection, [the album] is one of the freshest to come out in years." It is one of only 19 rap albums to receive a perfect rating from <i>XXL</i> magazine.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his consumer guide for <i>The Village Voice</i> and gave it a two-star honorable mention, indicating a "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." He cited "What Up Gangsta" and "Patiently Waiting" as highlights and said that 50 Cent "gets no cuter as his character unfolds" on the album. Kelefa Sanneh of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote that 50 Cent is "an appealing, mischievous character" whose talent for threatening raps aimed toward rivals is also limiting thematically.
