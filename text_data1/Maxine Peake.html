<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Peake was born in Westhoughton, Greater Manchester on 14 July 1974, the second of two daughters born to Glenys (<i>née</i> Hall) and Brian Peake. Her father was a lorry driver before working in the electrical industry, and her mother was a part-time careworker. Her older sister, Lisa (born 1965), is a police officer. Peake's parents separated when she was nine and she lived with her mother until the age of 15. When her mother moved in with a new boyfriend several miles away, Peake went to live with her grandfather so she could continue her GCSE studies at Westhoughton High School, before going on to take her A-Levels at Canon Slade School in Bradshaw. Her grandfather encouraged her to develop her creativity and start acting.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>Peake joined the Octagon Youth Theatre in Bolton at age 13, before a period at the youth theatre of the Royal Exchange in Manchester. She later did a two-year performing arts course at the Salford College of Technology. During this time she appeared in productions with two leading amateur theatre companies in Bolton: The Marco Players and The Phoenix Theatre Company. Peake was a member of the Communist Party of Britain Salford branch in her youth. In her teens, Peake played for Wigan Ladies rugby league team.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>Peake's early attempts to enter the acting profession were unsuccessful. She was rejected by every theatre education company in North West England, and tried unsuccessfully for three years to get into Manchester Polytechnic Theatre School and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. However, at 21, she obtained a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Her attempts to find sponsorship for RADA were the subject of a 1996 documentary by <i>The South Bank Show</i>. Eventually, after being put forward by RADA, she was awarded the Patricia Rothermere Scholarship.

<p>Peake has appeared in a number of television and stage productions including Victoria Wood's <i>Dinnerladies</i>, Channel 4's <i>Shameless</i>, in the lead role of barrister Martha Costello in the BBC's legal drama <i>Silk</i> and alongside John Simm in the BBC drama <i>The Village</i>, depicting life in a Derbyshire village during the First World War. Following career advice from Victoria Wood, between the two series of <i>Dinnerladies</i>, Peake lost so much weight that an explanation had to be written into the script for her character, Twinkle.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>Peake portrayed the Moors murderer Myra Hindley in <i>See No Evil: The Moors Murders</i>. Broadcast in May 2006, it was met with mixed reactions; soon after this Peake announced that she was leaving <i>Shameless</i>. January 2009 saw Peake appear in her first major feature film role, as Angela, in the film <i>Clubbed</i>.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>She has played the title role in <i>Miss Julie</i> at the Royal Exchange, Manchester. She previously played the part of Kristin in a 2000 production. as well as Doll Tearsheet in the BBC2 adaptations of <i>Henry IV, Parts I and II</i>.
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p><p>In November 2012, a play that Peake had written, directed and starred in about the life of the Leeds-born cyclist Beryl Burton was broadcast on BBC Radio Four as <i>Beryl: A Love Story On Two Wheels</i>. In 2014 Peake adapted her play for the stage.  Titled simply <i>Beryl</i>, it was commissioned by the West Yorkshire Playhouse where it ran in June and July 2014 to coincide with the start of the Tour de France in Leeds, returned in June and July 2015 and toured across England in Autumn 2015. Peake wrote a later play called <i>Queens of the Coal Age</i> again for Radio 4 that told the story of Annie Scargill and three other women who tried to occupy a coal mine during the 1980s Miners' Strike.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>Peake provided the vocals for the Eccentronic Research Council's 2012 concept album <i>1612 Underture</i> about the Pendle Witch Trials and for their 2015 album <i>Johnny Rocket, Narcissist &amp; Music Machine…I'm Your Biggest Fan</i>. Peake also features as a crazed stalker in the music video for "Sweet Saturn Mine" by Moonlandingz; a collaborative effort by Eccentronic Research Council and Fat White Family in 2015.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>In September 2013, Peake was appointed an Associate Artist of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. Her association with the theatre began in childhood and she was a member of the youth theatre. Major productions in which she has performed include <i>The Children's Hour</i> in 2008, for which she won a MEN Award, and <i>Miss Julie</i> in 2012 for which she won a Manchester Theatre Award. All of her performances at the Royal Exchange have been directed by Sarah Frankcom with whom she also collaborated on <i>The Masque of Anarchy</i> in 2012 for the Manchester International Festival. Building on this work, in September 2014 Frankcom went on to direct her as the title character in a radical re-imagining of <i>Hamlet</i>. The demand for tickets was so great that the production was extended for a week, having been "the theatre's fastest-selling show in a decade". <i>The Guardian</i> said of her performance: "Peake’s delicate ferocity, her particular mixture of concentration and lightness, ensure that you want to follow her whenever she appears". A year later she appeared in Frankcom's production of <i>The Skriker</i>, as "Caryl Churchill's shape-shifting, doom-wreaking fairy". <i>The Guardian</i>'s Lyn Gardner listed the production in her top ten British plays of the year. In 2016, Peake resumed her partnership with Royal Exchange Artistic Director, Sarah Frankcom, to star as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams' <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>. Peake's performance in the role garnered critical acclaim with The Guardian describing her performance as "exquisite" and "breathtaking."
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>In 2017 it was announced that Peake was to star in Mike Leigh's next feature, <i>Peterloo</i>, a feature film based on the events of the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester. In August 2017 it was revealed that Peake was to star in an episode of Netflix's <i>Black Mirror</i>. The episode entitled, "Metalhead", was directed by <i>Hannibal</i> and <i>American Gods</i> director, David Slade.
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p><p>Peake starred as the eponymous protagonist in the 2018 film Funny Cow alongside a cast including Paddy Considine and Stephen Graham. The film was written by and also starred Tony Pitts and received positive reviews, in particular praising Peake's "magnificent" performance .
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>Peake starred in, and won critical acclaim for, the lead role of Winnie in Samuel Beckett's Happy Days at the Royal Exchange Theatre in May 2018, with The Guardian calling hers a "brilliant central performance, there’s barely a breath between optimism and despair." Following Happy Days, the theatre presented <i>Queens of the Coal Age</i>, a play written by Peake. Adapted from her earlier radio drama, <i>Queens of the Coal</i> age looks at the early 1990s pit closure protests by miners' wives in northern England. The play was met with mixed reviews.
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>Peake is set to star in <i>The Nico Project</i> as Velvet Underground singer Nico at the Manchester International Festival in July 2019.

<p>Peake brings her views into much of her work. She is a feminist and socialist. She was active in communist organisations during her youth and a member of Communist Party of Britain. In January 2014, Peake won the first Bolton Socialist Club Outstanding Contribution to Socialism Award, for using her work to oppose the government's "crippling austerity measures".
<a name="text16"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></a></p><p>In July 2015, Peake endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. She wrote on her website: "For me, Jeremy Corbyn is our only beacon of hope to get the Labour Party back on track, get the electorate back in touch with politics and save this country from the constant mindless bullying of the vulnerable and poor."
<a name="text17"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></a></p><p>In January 2016, Peake featured in the Climate Coalition's short film <i>I Wish For You</i> as Mia, with Jeremy Irons starring as her grandfather, to highlight the urgency on combating climate change.
<a name="text18"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></a></p><p>In 2016, along with numerous other celebrities, Peake toured the UK to support Jeremy Corbyn's bid to become Prime Minister.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></a></p><p>In April 2017, she endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. She said: "I am a Corbyn supporter. My mind boggles why people treat him like the anti-Christ, but it goes to show people are a lot more right-wing than they like to believe."
<a name="text20"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>In 2009, Peake left London after living there for 13 years. The move freed her of the financial constraints of trying to buy a house in the area. Living in Salford with her art director partner Pawlo Wintoniuk, she says, gave her the freedom to choose more risky roles and lower-paying jobs in theatre. "For the last few years I have been lucky enough to choose what I want to do. Living in Salford gives me the confidence to do that because I don't have a massive mortgage." In 2014, she said that in an attempt to have children she had explored every option, including IVF treatments, and has suffered two miscarriages.
