<p>Riding the bus one day, Sakura SakurakÅji looks out the window to see people being burned alive with a blue fire as a boy her age remains unharmed and stands over the people. When she goes back to the site the next day, there are no corpses or evidence of any kind of murder, just a small fire. When Sakura goes to class, she discovers the new transfer student is the same boy she saw the day before. Sakura soon learns that he is Rei ÅŒgami, the sixth "Code: Breaker," a special type of assassin with a strange ability and a member of a secret organization that serves the government.

While riding the bus home one night, Sakura SakurakÅji sees a boy seemingly burning people to death with blue flames in the park. After she alerts a policeman to come with her to the park, there seems to be no trace of anything having occurred, though Sakura remains adamant in what she saw. The next day at school a new transfer student is assigned to her class and it turns out to be the same boy she saw in the park, Code:Breaker 06 Rei ÅŒgami. Even though she questions him, ÅŒgami is able to provide a sound alibi for his actions, though not convincing Sakura. After school, while lamenting the death of a homeless man in the park by the G-Falcon street gang, Sakura meets ÅŒgami where they have a talk about what it means to judge the actions of criminals. The next day, while visiting a stray dog in the park, Sakura witnesses the G-Falcon gang attacking another person and intervenes. She is able to hold them off with her martial arts until getting stunned with a Taser. The dog also tries to protect Sakura, but the gang members severely injure it. Just when Sakura is about to be killed, ÅŒgami shows up and kills the dog, who he deemed was beyond saving, much to Sakura's horror. He then turns to the gang members and presents an ultimatum - turn themselves in or die. They then attack ÅŒgami, choosing the second option. ÅŒgami then uses his power of summoning blue flames to eradicate them all. ÅŒgami then walks up to the shocked Sakura and uses the flames to kill her.</td></tr>

Sakura wakes up in her room the following morning after seemingly being killed by ÅŒgami. At school, Sakura grows highly cautious of ÅŒgami despite him acting as if nothing transpired the night before whilst among their peers. ÅŒgami then follows Sakura around school, which causes her to avoid her friend Aoba Takatsu in an attempt to protect her from ÅŒgami. Elsewhere, Code:Breaker 03 YÅ«ki TenpÅin is given a picture of Ex-Code:Breaker 01 Hitomi as his opponent. After school Sakura draws ÅŒgami to a populated city square, where she tries to reason with him about killing those men the night before. however she still is not able to accept that he can commit such acts without any emotional response. ÅŒgami explains to her the nature of his being as a Code:Breaker, which is one who passes judgement on evildoers via means that would be considered "evil" to the rest of the world. ÅŒgami then tries to burn Sakura, who flees from fright. However, he does state that he will kill anyone with whom she confides his secret, causing Sakura to also make sure that he does not kill any more people by keeping an eye on him. Afterwards, ÅŒgami receives a call from a mysterious woman wondering why Sakura is not dead, to which ÅŒgami says that she is a rare person who cannot be burnt.

YÅ«ki attacks Hitomi with sound waves, but is stopped by Re-Code Agent 04 Yukihina, who has the special ability of controlling ice. Sakura goes to school ÅŒgami and finds her locker stuffed with love letters from fellow students. The misunderstanding about Sakura and ÅŒgami's desires to observe each other leads the students to believe they are dating. Jealousy of ÅŒgami with Sakura turns into violence, but Sakura prevents this for fear of ÅŒgami using his powers. While walking to the Student Council office with ÅŒgami, Sakura runs into Nenene Fujiwara, who fondles Sakura's breasts. ÅŒgami attempts to burn Nenene, mistaking her for somebody else, but is stopped by Sakura.

When she comes outside of her house, she meets Toki, who walks with her to school. However, ÅŒgami suddenly appears and immediately begins to fight Toki, that is until Sakura stops the two. Sakura and ÅŒgami head to school after Toki leaves. At school, Sakura spots Toki, and she leaves class to find out what he is doing.

ÅŒgami reveals Toki's power is that of controlling magnetic fields and this can move any metallic object.

During the battle, the two guards are forced to retreat when their backpacks suddenly run dry, allowing ÅŒgami and Toki to continue with the mission. Inside the facility, Sakura learns that the Code:Breakers are a government agency run directly under the command of the Prime Minister. The facility houses kids with special abilities hooked up to machines for close monitoring, in which the lower levels of the facility are used for experiments via dissections, having their organs removed and sold and their corpses placed in large preservative jars. Tabata is revealed to be the head of the research facility. The two guards return and resume their fight with ÅŒgami and Toki, who both discover that the backpacks each contained a child with special abilities, who each had a younger sibling among the failed experiments. The two children finally rest in peace when ÅŒgami and Toki kill the guards. Just as ÅŒgami is about to kill Tabata, his crippled daughter Chisa Shigeru appears. It turns out that Tabata performed such experiments in order to find suitable transplants for Chisa, who also has special abilities. Sakura tries to convince ÅŒgami not to kill Tabata, but ÅŒgami has no choice but to kill Tabata, who tried to attack him with a scalpel. Chisa passes out after ÅŒgami goads her to take revenge on him in the future, and Toki finds out that Hitomi is the real mastermind behind the research project.

While Toki has lunch with the Prime Minister, who is actually his father, he is reminded that he became a Code:Breaker in order to keep his sister Nenene away from his father in order to protect her. On their way to school, Sakura and ÅŒgami run into Code:Breaker 05 Rui "Prince" HachiÅji, who gives ÅŒgami orders to protect Sakura. At school, the class is acting strangely, which causes ÅŒgami to suspect that Sakura has exposed his secret as a Code:Breaker. However, it turns out that the class was actually preparing a welcome party for ÅŒgami. At the same time, Toki is seen collapsing in pain in an alley someplace, and the Prime Minister is informed that a total of 43 agents have gone missing in search of Hitomi. Back at the party, the school is attacked by the 43 missing agents, whose dead bodies have been reanimated through the use of Hitomi's power. ÅŒgami momentarily collapses while fighting the dead agents. Kanda arrives to help, revealing herself as an agent of Eden assigned to ÅŒgami. YÅ«ki also appears to assist them in fending off the attack. Code:Breaker 02 Masaomi Heike, a classmate of Sakura and ÅŒgami who habitually has tea in the most random of places, joins the fight as well and successfully defeats the agents using light manipulation.

ÅŒgami's collapse causes him to be in his Lost Form, a state which will last 24 hours due to the overuse of his powers. The symptoms vary for each Code:Breaker, of which ÅŒgami suffers from hypothermia in his case. Sakura volunteers her house as a secure location for ÅŒgami to recover. When Sakura bring YÅ«ki, Heike and Kanda there, they are welcomed by her father GÅtoku SakurakÅji, head of the highly respected yakuza clan called the Kizakura. After her cosplaying mother Yuki SakurakÅji brings them to the guesthouse, it is revealed that Toki, who is already there, is in his Lost Form called age regression, which explains his childlike appearance. While ÅŒgami is resting, the others have a feast together. At night, Heike informs Toki that Hitomi might be targeting both ÅŒgami and Sakura, but has no idea why. The next morning, Rui is ordered to go to Sakura's house to provide support for both ÅŒgami and Toki. When Hitomi raids Sakura's house in order to kidnap Sakura, the Code:Breakers do their best to fight back against his electrical attacks. Hitomi then unleashes his full power against them, but Sakura jumps in front of his attack and is surprisingly unharmed. It turns out that Hitomi's attack was just a decoy to gather all the Code:Breakers, thus leaving an opening for Yukihina to kidnap the Prime Minister.

While the Code:Breakers discuss what their next plan of action should be, Toki leaves, uninterested in rescuing his father. As the Code:Breakers continue to discuss their plan, none except ÅŒgami have the convictions to kill their former leader. Toki goes to Nenene, who seems to remember him, but she suddenly reverts back to her old self, unaware of who Toki is. While the Kizakura members who were injured during Hitomi's attack are being tended to their wounds, Sakura finds ÅŒgami looking at her family photo album. ÅŒgami is explained that GÅtoku and Yuki adopted Sakura as a child after finding her outside on their doorstep one night with blood splattered all over her. Meanwhile, YÅ«ki and Rui reminisce about when Hitomi used to be good. When Toki returns, Sakura and the other Code:Breakers head out in search of Hitomi and the Prime Minister. At school, Kanda meets with several other faculty members, all of whom work for Eden as Code:Breakers supporters. Since Kanda is a former subordinate of Hitomi, the plan is for her to use any possible remaining trust to kill Hitomi. After Rui meets with Heike at a bridge, he attacks her for figuring out that he is a part of Hitomi's scheme. YÅ«ki, as Rui tries to keep the bridge from collapsing, witnesses Heike attack her from afar.

Hitomi shows his clock collection on the wall, each stopped at a time when a former Code:Breaker was killed. Hitomi plans to execute the Prime Minister, but he first bombs the city full of civilians as a spectacle of exposing Code:Breakers, in order to recognize them as great heroes rather than dangerous outcasts. ÅŒgami disagrees with this cause and burns all the clocks, but as ÅŒgami proceeds to attack Hitomi, Yukihina arrives and intervenes, taking the Prime Minister with him. Although ÅŒgami is unable to do anything since his flames cannot melt Yukihina's ice, Toki arrives just in time to save ÅŒgami and Sakura from a barrage of ice.

When Hitomi was sixteen years old, he was inaugurated as Code:Breaker 06, and due to his excellence at his job, he was considered a promotion. Heike was revealed as his senior at that time. Four years later, Hitomi's unnamed partner, Code:Breaker 05 at the time, was killed during an operation, and it is shown that his watch stopped working the moment he died. Heike promoted Hitomi as the new Code:Breaker 05, but Hitomi was greatly troubled by his partner's death. Six years later, being assigned to take out a terrorist coupe of supernaturals, Hitomi, as Code:Breaker 03, is distraught when the rest of his group except Hitomi died during the mission, and only the leader rogue supernatural managed to escape. Hitomi, explaining to Heike that Code:Breaker 06 at that time was killed by her own powers, requested him to investigate upon the matter. With Hitomi promoted to Code:Breaker 01, he was tasked to train the recruited Code:Breakers (YÅ«ki, Toki, Rui and ÅŒgami), initiating them as Code:Breakers after their individual training sessions. However, Hitomi took concern for ÅŒgami's primary focus of eliminating evil without thought of any consequences. During a rescue mission with ÅŒgami and Toki, Hitomi is seen carrying a child, which was the real objective of the rescue mission. Hitomi later told ÅŒgami that their purpose should be protecting the powerless and not simply killing the wicked. On another job with the other Code:Breakers, Hitomi finally killed the leader rogue supernatural to avenge the deaths of his former comrades. Heike later informed Hitomi that the Code:Breakers could die if they overuse their own powers numerous times, which was something Eden had kept them from knowing. Although Hitomi failed to reveal this to ÅŒgami, he silently vowed to get revenge on Eden. In the present, Hitomi announces to the public on Sky Tower that he will kill the Prime Minister and 50,000 other civilians across Japan.</td></tr>

Just as Hitomi is about to play his final trump card, Sky Tower is covered in Rui's shadow ability and the rest of the Code:Breakers arrive to stop Hitomi, who continues to rationalize his cause. ÅŒgami then reenters the fight, removing his thumb ring, which causes his power to rise exponentially.</td></tr>

After a quick flashback of when ÅŒgami had his first training session with Hitomi, ÅŒgami's blue flames easily absorbs Hitomi's strongest electricity blasts, resulting both of them to collapse. Hitomi is reaching his Code:End as his own powers begin to attack him. Hitomi, still wanting to continue his plan, is beaten back by ÅŒgami. As he lies defeated and says his last words to all the Code:Breakers, Hitomi encourages them to make themselves public as the ones who defeated him and his plot. However, the Prime Minister appears and says otherwise, which enrages Hitomi. The Code:Breakers manages to stop him from killing the Prime Minister and Hitomi finally reaches his Code:End and dies in the arms of ÅŒgami, who leaves after justifying that Hitomi got what he deserved. Toki overhears the public crediting the police department for disabling the bombs and killing Hitomi. Later, Heike and the Prime Minister discuss that they succeeded in having ÅŒgami battle Hitomi to draw out his true power, which they are curious if this power will fare against the "Seekee". They would use Sakura to be with ÅŒgami to extinguish his flames if ever he ever goes out of control. The Prime Minister coughs up blood when a electrical spark shocks his body. Sakura individually says farewell to YÅ«ki, Rui and Toki, who each are assigned missions of their own, mentioning that ÅŒgami has already left as well. As Sakura returns to her normal life, ÅŒgami goes on a mission with Kanda at an airport, battling a man with the special ability of wind.</td></tr>
