<p>"Love on the Brain" was the first song commissioned for Rihanna's album <i>Anti</i>.  Written by Norwegian songwriter and producer Fred Ball and American songwriter Joseph Angel in late 2013, inspiration for the song came from Prince and Al Green. Ball recalled, "We wanted it to have that juxtaposition of an old school soul feel with modern lyrics. That's why Amy Winehouse was never pastiche or retro even though her music has an old soul sound." Ball also stated that they did not write the song with Rihanna in mind, however his manager at Roc Nation, Jay Brown, heard the song and loved it. Brown sent it to Rihanna and she also reacted similarly, writing additional lyrics.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>American producer Kuk Harrell handled the song's vocal production. Ball and Angel also supplied the song's keyboards and drums. "Love on the Brain" was recorded at Westlake Studios in Los Angeles. The vocal recording was carried out by Marcos Tovar for Allfadersup and Harrell. The song was finally mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, along with mixing assistants Chris Galland, Jeff Jackson and Ike Schultz, before being mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, in New York City.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>"Love on the Brain" was first announced as a recorded track in 2015, and was to be debuted at the 2015 Brit Awards, however Rihanna allegedly pulled out. In early August 2016, Philadelphia radio personality Mike Adam stated that "Love on the Brain" would be the album's fourth single, later confirmed by Rihanna herself on August 21, 2016. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radios on September 27, impacted contemporary hit radio on October 11, and the hot adult contemporary stations on November 14.

<p>"Love on the Brain" is a mid-tempo '50s and '60s inspired doo-wop and soul ballad, with a "rock edge". Its instrumentation consists of a "guitar arpeggio," "swirling organ", a "simple chord progression", syncopated strings, and "a wave of an orchestra". Written in the key of G major, it has a tempo of 57 beats per minute in compound quadruple (<span style="font-family: 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.3em;vertical-align:-0.4em;line-height:0.85em;font-size:80%;text-align:center"><br/><sub style="font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;vertical-align:baseline"><b>8</b></sub></span></span>) time. The song follows a chord progression of G–Am–Em–D, and Rihanna's vocals span from D<sub>3</sub> to G<sub>5</sub>.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>Rihanna's vocals were noted as being acrobatic ranging from her "trademark snarl", to high notes, complemented by all-tenor backing vocals. Forrest Wickman of <i>Slate</i> magazine commented that the song "seems designed as a showcase for Rihanna’s vocal versatility: She starts out singing high and sweet, then drops into her chest to show off the lower part of her range and finally gets into powerful belting. She even does a few seconds of what sounds like Frankie Valli's falsetto." Jordan Bassett of <i>NME</i> compared her high notes to those of Mariah Carey, while <i>Vibe</i> magazine and USA Today noted similarities with the work of Erykah Badu. Amy Winehouse, Etta James and Sam Cooke were also perceived as influences by critics, with <i>Michigan Daily</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'s</span> Christian Kennedy citing Winehouse's song "Wake Up Alone" as the song that Rihanna had borrowed from "stylistically."
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>"Love on the Brain" has dark lyrics that depict a destructive, yet addictive relationship, with themes of "swinging back and forth between the highs and lows of love". Some critics believed the song was an "ode to a violent lover", possibly referring to Chris Brown after the pair's highly published domestic violence case. Lyrical examples include "It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good / That I can't get enough / Must be love on the brain." Adam R. Holz of the conservative organization Focus on the Family's website PluggedIn.com noted the song "mingles nihilism, lust and at least the metaphorical presence of physical abuse". Jessica Eggert of Mic agreed, noting that "Rihanna wears her heart right on her sleeve and takes no prisoners in expressing the pain of a metaphorically and physically damaging-yet-undying love."

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h2>
<p>Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic picked it as a highlight from the album, noting that Rihanna's "voice is hoarse and ravaged, yet she's also controlled and precise, knowing how to hone these imperfections so her performance echoes classic soul while feeling fresh". Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of <i>Billboard</i> deemed it "a doo-wop powerhouse sung in a Prince-adjacent falsetto — and is proof Rihanna’s been working with some primo vocal coaches". Idolator's Bianca Gracie also complimented her vocals, writing that the "rough-edged, soulful ballad finds Rih at her vocal best". Patrick Ryan of <i>USA Today</i> called the song an "easy highlight," noting the "cozy doo-wop nostalgia". Emily Mackay of <i>NME</i> noted the doo-wop groove, deeming Rihanna's vocals a "powerhouse vocal performance". Jordan Bassett of the same publication called it "totally brilliant, with the singer showcasing the kind of vocals we’ve not heard from her before". Safy-Hallan Farah of <i>Spin</i> wrote favorably of her singing, while James Grabay of the same magazine named it an "effortlessly time-traveling track".
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>Chris Gerard of <i>PopMatters</i> noted the song was "one of the more interesting tracks on the album", addressing her "Macy Gray-like drawl during the verses". Corbin Reiff of <i>The A.V. Club</i> highlighted the track's "deep soulful tones" and felt her voice was "the undeniable focal point" of it. Nolan Feeney of <i>Time</i> declared that "Love on the Brain" and "Higher" "offer the most stirring vocal performances of her career". Jessica McKinney of <i>Vibe</i> agreed, calling the song a "soulful performance that showcases her own range". Neil McCormick of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> wrote that "Love on the Brain" is a "standard, mid-tempo retro soul anthem" that "in the context of <i>Anti</i>,...sounds like a work of pop genius". Calling it "hypnotic," Eric Renner Brown of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> remarked that "she delivers some of her finest vocal moments yet". Sarah Rodman of <i>The Boston Globe</i> picked it as "essential", stating: "As she implores 'Don't you stop loving me,' her performance has a grit, sweat, and weariness to it that's unusual and humanizing."
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>Da'Shan Smith of <i>Billboard</i> stated "Love on the Brain" became the most subtly influential Pop single of 2017, as the music industry experienced "a prominent surge of retro-harkening balladry, across different musical genres", following the success of this song on Pop radio; which he described as "a rare find today, because traditional R&amp;B’s presence on the format is an oddity." "Love On The Brain" received a nomination for Choice Music: Pop Song at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards. Marilyn Manson cited <i>Anti</i> as an influence on his band's album <i>Heaven Upside Down</i>, saying "Strangely enough, one of the records that influenced this album strongly, and it can’t be taken literally, is Rihanna, her last record. That one song, ‘Love on the Brain’, it really hit me because I saw her perform it and she just… meant it."

<p>Rihanna included "Love on the Brain" in the encore of her Anti World Tour. After attending the show at Wembley Stadium, Lewis Corner of <i>Digital Spy</i> called the performance "a triumph, as Rihanna's tone on the Motown sway is pure joy". Michael Cragg of <i>The Guardian</i> claimed that the performance was "delivered with such conviction it feels like you’re watching a different artist". On May 22, 2016, Rihanna performed the song at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards, with <i>Billboard</i> describing it as a "standout" of the event. Sarah Grant of <i>Rolling Stone</i> called it a "gut-wrenching solo performance," comparing her stage persona to that of Whitney Houston, due to the "storm of tour-de-force vocals".
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></a></p><p>On August 28, 2016, Rihanna received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. In honour, she performed a medley consisting of "Stay", "Diamonds" and "Love on the Brain". Christopher Rosa of <i>Glamour</i> called the performance "breath-taking", whilst <i>Billboard</i> noted: "Her vocals, which are sometimes under-appreciated by critics and even fans, were gorgeous and impressive, reminding everyone that beyond the chart-toppers and DGAF behavior, there's an astonishing voice that propelled her to where she is now".
