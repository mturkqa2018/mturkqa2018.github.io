<p>"<b>Beautiful Day</b>" is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the first track on their tenth studio album, <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> (2000), and was released as the album's lead single on 9 October 2000. The song was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date.
<a name="text2"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></a></p><p>Like many tracks from <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>, "Beautiful Day" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>The song received positive reviews, and it became the band's 14th number-one single in their native Ireland, fourth number-one in the United Kingdom, and their first number-one in the Netherlands. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Norway, Scotland and Spain, and reached the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. The song peaked at number 21 on the  <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in the United States, the band's highest position since "DiscothÃ¨que" in 1997.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>In 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The group has played "Beautiful Day" at every one of their concerts since the song's live debut on the Elevation Tour in 2001.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_and_recording">Writing and recording</span></h2>
<p>"Beautiful Day" was written in several stages, originating from a composition called "Always" (later released as a B-side) that the band created in a small room at Hanover Quay Studio. However, they were initially unimpressed with it, as guitarist the Edge said, "As a straight rock song, it was pretty ho-hum." After lead vocalist Bono came up with the "beautiful day" lyric, the song went in a different direction. The Edge's backing vocals for the chorus were improvised one night with co producer Daniel Lanois, an addition he called "the key" to the chorus and its new lyrics.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>During the recording process for the <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> album, the band decided to distance themselves from their 1990s experimentation with electronic dance music in favour of a "return to the traditional U2 sound". At the same time, the band was looking for a more forward looking sound.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>This led to debate amongst the band when the Edge was playing the song on his Gibson Explorer guitar with a tone used in much of their early material up to their 1983 album <i>War</i>. Bono was particularly resistant to the guitar tone the Edge was playing with, but the Edge ultimately won the disagreement. As he explains, "It was because we were coming up with some innovative music that I felt a license to use some signature guitar sounds."
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p><p>Although the group wished to establish a more stripped-down, conventional sound, one of the song's breakthroughs came after co producer Brian Eno provided "electronification of the chords with a beat box" and a synthesised string part to the beginning. The Edge believes the contrast between these more electronic qualities of the track and his backing vocals with Lanois benefited the song.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>The mixing process proved difficult, lasting two weeks. Several changes were made during this period; Bono added a guitar part that played the song's chord progression to double the bass, an addition that "solidified everything", according to the Edge. The Edge also changed the bass line in the chorus and converted a keyboard idea of Bono's into a guitar part that added a "sour quality" to balance the track's positivity. Lanois described the completed song as "one of those little gifts where you think, my god, we've got it!"
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Composition">Composition</span></h2>
<p>"Beautiful Day" is played at a tempo of 136 beats per minute in a 4/4 time signature. The song opens with a reverberating electric piano playing over a string synthesiser, introducing the chord progression of Aâ€“Bm<sub>7</sub>â€“Dâ€“Gâ€“D<sub>9</sub>â€“A. This progression continues throughout the verses and chorus, the changes not always one to a bar. After the opening line, "The heart is a bloom", the rhythm enters, comprising repeated eighth notes on bass guitar and a drum machine. In the first verse, Bono's vocals are in the front in the mix and their production is dry. At 0:29, a guitar arpeggio pattern by the Edge first appears, echoing across channels. The verses are relatively quiet until the chorus, when the Edge begins playing the song's guitar riff and Mullen's drums enter. During the chorus, Bono sings in a restrained manner, contrasting with the Edge's "loud, bellowing" background vocals, a sustained cry of "day".
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>After the second chorus, a bridge section begins at 1:55, playing the chord progression F<span class="music-symbol" style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span class="music-sharp">â™¯</span></span>mâ€“Gâ€“Dâ€“A, heightening the track's emotion as Bono sings "Touch me / Take me to that other place". The bridge links to the middle eight with a section in which the Edge repeats a modulated two note phrase on guitar, beginning at 2:08. After seven seconds, the rhythm breaks and the middle eight begins. The chords in this section follow a progression of Emâ€“Dâ€“Emâ€“Gâ€“Dâ€“Emâ€“Gâ€“Dâ€“A, implying a key of D major. The bass plays a G note beneath the Em chord, implying a chord change does not occur. The lyrics for this section are set in space above Earth and describe the sights that one witnesses, including China, the Grand Canyon, tuna fleets, and Bedouin fires. After the third chorus and a return of the bridge section, the song suddenly ends in a "low-key" fashion; most of the instrumentation stops and a regeneration of a guitar signal drifts back and forth between channels before fading out.
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p><p>According to Bono, "Beautiful Day" is about "a man who has lost everything, but finds joy in what he still has." <i>Blender</i> interpreted the song and the line "it's a beautiful day" as "a vision of abandoning material things and finding grace in the world itself". In his 2001 book <i>Inside Classic Rock Tracks</i>, Rikki Rooksby described the lyrics as having a "fuzzy" quality and covering an "ambiguous subject area between religion and romance". He found "grace and salvation" in the verses' lyrics and believed that despite not explicitly explaining how to emotionally persevere, the song has "so many suggestive images that it's enough".
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>In an episode of the Sundance Channel's <i>Iconoclast</i>, R.E.M.'s lead singer Michael Stipe said, "I love that song. I wish I'd written it, and they know I wish I'd written it. It makes me dance; it makes me angry that I didn't write it."
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p>

<p>Ever since its tour debut at the first date of the Elevation Tour on 24 March 2001 in Miami, "Beautiful Day" has been played at every single full tour concert as well as a number of promotional appearances and concerts not connected with a tour. On the Elevation Tour, "Beautiful Day" was normally the second song played, though it did open one show, and was played late in the set list at two concerts. During the Vertigo Tour, it appeared in the first half of the main set.
<a name="text17"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></a></p><p>On the U2 360Â° Tour, it typically appeared early in the main set, it also opened some concerts in the early 2011 shows. For the final leg of the tour it was moved back to the midpoint of the show and featured a video of astronaut Mark Kelly. On the Innocence + Experience Tour it has either appeared late in the main set or during the encore.
<a name="text18"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></a></p><p>It is featured on the live films <i>Elevation 2001: Live from Boston</i>, <i>U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle</i>, and <i>Vertigo 2005: Live From Chicago</i>. The song was also performed on stage during U2's set at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park in London. with slightly different lyrics in the bridge that mentioned the different cities where the Live 8 concerts took place.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></a></p><p>It was performed live in New Orleans for Super Bowl XXXVI and for the New Orleans Saints first game in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina. During the band's five-night stand on the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i> to promote their album <i>No Line on the Horizon</i> in March 2009, "Beautiful Day" was the only song not from that album that was played.
<a name="text20"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></a></p><p>The song was also played during every show of the 360Â° Tour. During the final leg of the tour in 2011, a recorded video from NASA astronaut Mark Kelly was used as a lead-in to the song. Kelly had previously chosen the song for a wake up call on Space Shuttle flight STS-134.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h2>
<p>"Beautiful Day" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Olaf Tyaransen of <i>Hot Press</i> called the song "surprisingly straightforward but still infectiously catchy", while the magazine's Peter Murphy said the track broke the band's trend of releasing lead singles that broke new sonic ground but were not the best songs from their respective albums. Murphy called the song a "patented U2 cavalry charge from <i>U2 3</i> through <i>The Joshua Tree</i> to Jubilee 2000". <i>The Guardian</i> said the song "strikes an appropriate note of putting the past behind you and getting on with the rest of your life". The review praised the track for its "bustling beat", "contagious chorus and vintage guitar chimes from Edge". Robert Hilburn of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> called the track proof that the band's music had once again been "graced by the glorious textures of Edge's guitar, and [that] Bono has dropped the masks". <i>Rolling Stone</i> called the song "poised, then pouncing" and said it was one of many from the album that has a "resonance that doesn't fade with repeated listening". <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> was critical of the song, saying it was not "driven by the fire of true believers", but rather by the band's need for a hit, and that it was "a move to solidify a base that may already have slipped away".
<a name="text22"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></a></p><p>David Browne of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> was very receptive to "Beautiful Day", noting that the chorus "erupts into a euphoric bellow so uplifting" that it was played during a television broadcast of the 2000 Summer Olympics. Browne called the "classic U2 arrangement" of the song "corny", but said, "damn if it isn't effective". He said the song made him reminiscent of the band's glory days in the late 1980s when so much popular music sought to be "sonically and emotionally uplifting". Edna Gundersen of <i>USA Today</i> was enthusiastic about the song, calling it "euphoric" and suggesting it was "breathing fresh air into playlists choking on synthetic pop and seething rap-rock". The <i>Detroit Free Press</i> was critical of the album for being pedestrian but called "Beautiful Day" one of the album's "flashes of triumph", describing it as "a gloriously busy, layered song that recalls Bono's lyrically astute <i>Achtung Baby</i> days". <i>NME</i> published a negative review of the song after its single release that suggested John Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman, should be released from prison to shoot Bono, a statement that <i>Hot Press</i> called "poisonous" and "tasteless". The publication was more receptive to the song after the release of <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>, saying the album "eas[es] in with the heat-hazy optimism" of the track.

DeWyze commented "I like that song a lot (...) Is it something that is necessarily in my genre? No. There were songs on the table, and I went with the one I thought would represent the moment the best." The cover reached number 24 on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and number 13 on the Canadian Hot 100. "Beautiful Day" was also covered by 2010 <i>X Factor Australia</i> winner Altiyan Childs for his self-titled debut album.
