<p><i><b>Demanufacture</b></i> is the second studio album by American industrial metal band Fear Factory, released on June 13, 1995 by Roadrunner Records. Burton C. Bell wrote the majority of the lyrics and Dino Cazares wrote all the music. This is the band's first album with their classic line-up; adding new bassist Christian Olde Wolbers. Although credited, his actual input is disputed between current and former band members. Many regard it as the band's best album and a heavy metal classic. The album was certified Gold in Australia by ARIA and Silver in the UK by the BPI.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Album_information">Album information</span></h2>
<p><i>Demanufacture</i> is a concept album about a man's struggles against a machine-controlled government, with each song a chapter in his life. The band stated the album took its inspiration from the movie <i>The Terminator</i>.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>This album was originally mixed by its producer Colin Richardson, who had performed both duties on the band's debut album. However, differences between the band and producer emerged over the mix, with Richardson wishing not to stray too far from <i>Soul of a New Machine</i>. In the 2005 re-release liner notes, Monte Conner notes Richardson's focus on the guitars at the expense of the electronics, and suggests that this is the reason for the rejection of Richardson's mix. The final mix for the album was subsequently performed by Greg Reely, Rhys Fulber and the band. The Richardson mixes of "Zero Signal" and "Body Hammer" were later released on the <i>Hatefiles</i> compilation.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>The album was recorded at Bearsville Studios in rural New York. Also in residence at the studio was Bon Jovi, recording their album <i>These Days</i>. Fear Factory were in the studio next door and one of Bon Jovi's engineers asked them to turn the sound down, as it was bleeding into Bon Jovi's recording sessions.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>After the release of the album, some critics and observers suggested that drummer Raymond Herrera had in fact used a drum machine, due to the often blistering speed and machine-like precision of the drumming, most notably on the bass drums. He records, however, with a click track to keep time. He is also known to use triggers on his drum sets for the purpose of keeping the sound of his drums consistent, particularly bass drums, regardless of how hard they are struck. This is a common strategy used by metal drummers when playing at such speeds, as relatively few drummers are able to achieve such rapid and consistent notes without the use of triggers.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>Samples, loops, and electronic textures were handled by Rhys Fulber and Reynor Diego throughout the album. The music for "A Therapy For Pain" was originally written as the opening for "Echoes of Innocence" from the then-unreleased <i>Concrete</i> demo. The outro passage was inspired by John Carpenter, Hijokaidan, and Aphex Twin. The use of organ in "Dog Day Sunrise" was inspired from a in-joke between Diego and Bell about The Doors. During post-production work with Richardson, Bell performed and added the organ parts to the track.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>The opening riff of the title track was voted 19th in <i>Total Guitar</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s list of "The Heaviest Riffs of all Time". The opening sample for "Pisschrist" and "Zero Signal" are both taken from <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>. <i>Concrete</i> also had a track named "Piss Christ", but the two bear no similarities other than the title.
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p><p>The song "Replica" has been covered by Dutch symphonic metal band Epica on their album <i>The Divine Conspiracy</i>, Divine Heresy and Roadrunner United live. Cyber metal band Mechina covered the track "Zero Signal".
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>The original digipaks had slightly different artwork, most noticeably a different barcode on the front cover, and different colouring within the words "Fear Factory". The digipak was re-released in 2003 with all bonus tracks mentioned above, but with the new Roadrunner Records logo on the front and back and different lettering on the spine. This version is not limited, but has since been replaced by the remastered edition detailed below. In all, four different digipak versions of the album are available.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>Tracks 1 to 4 were featured on <i>The Best of Fear Factory</i>.
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>In July 2013, the band toured Australia performing <i>Demanufacture</i> in its entirety.
<a name="text12"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Involvement_of_Christian_Olde_Wolbers">Involvement of Christian Olde Wolbers</span></h3>
<p>Although Christian Olde Wolbers is credited as a band member and appears in the band photo in the album booklet (but lacks songwriting credit), Dino Cazares has repeatedly claimed that he played bass himself on all tracks; because Olde Wolbers joined after recording was complete but before the album's release and promotional tour. However, former drummer Raymond Hererra has said that Olde Wolbers was a full member during recording but was still absent on some tracks. This was due to Cazares altering many parts during tracking of his guitars. To save production time, Cazares played bass on these tracks. Olde Wolbers later mentioned in an interview in 2004 that he made a small contribution to the writing of the title track and "Pisschrist".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="In_popular_culture">In popular culture</span></h2>
<p>The video for the song "Replica" is unlockable in the video game <i>Test Drive 5</i>. Several songs from this album were used without lyrics for the game <i>Carmageddon</i>. These were "Demanufacture", "Zero Signal" (which had the piano ending omitted) and "Body Hammer". The song "Zero Signal" was featured on the soundtrack to the movie <i>Mortal Kombat</i> and can be heard in part during the fight scene between Scorpion and Johnny Cage. In reference to this, the band regularly featured a vocal sample of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character of Shang Tsung in the movie saying "Fatality" during live performances of the song thereafter. "Demanufacture" was used in the opening video of GameShark 2 released by Mad Catz in 2004, along with numerous other Fear Factory songs.

<p>Upon its release, Demanufacture was extraordinarily successful among music critics and the band's fans. It is often called a landmark record in alternative metal, and heavy metal in general, and is often regarded as the band's best album. Andrew Kapper of about.com named Demanufacture as the recommended album to listen to by the band, and stated in his review  â€³Demanufacture
Quite rightly regarded as one of the finest metal releases to come out in the last 25 years, Demanufacture was a game changer in the metal world. Backed with a mechanical assault of machine gun drum work and guitar riffs, Burton C. Bellâ€™s groundbreaking extreme to clean vocals take the center stage, with enormous hooks covering tracks like â€œReplicaâ€, â€œZero Signalâ€ and the title track, while keyboard and synths create both harsh and lush counterpoints across the record. A classic LP that deserves to be in any serious metalheadâ€™s collection.â€³ 
<a name="text15"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></a></p>
<ul><li><i>Kerrang!</i> (p.Â 61) - "[T]his is a landmark of '90s metal that defied categorisation and remains a touchstone of the genre."</li>
<li><i>Kerrang!</i> (p.Â 51) - "[With] sonorous, soaring vocal hooks. The melding of power and melody proved a statement of absolute power."</li>
<li><i>Metal Hammer</i> (p.Â 60) - "So far ahead of its time that bands are still failing to rip it off convincingly today, Fear Factory's ultra-precise extreme metal attack and pioneering harsh-to-clean vocal approach dragged metal into the future."</li></ul>
<p>"Replica" was covered by Dutch female-fronted metal band Epica in 2007 as part of a "deluxe re-release" of the album <i>The Divine Conspiracy</i>, and was performed live by them at the Whisky a Go Go with Dino Cazares joining on stage in September 2007. "Flashpoint" was covered as a one-man effort by American metal artist Common Dead in 2012 as a standalone single. "Pisschrist" was covered by American heavy metal band Byzantine in 2016 as part of their re-release of their 2015 album To Release Is to Resolve for the European region.
