<p>Morén and Yttling began playing music with each other while in school. They shared an interest in bands such as The Stone Roses and Ride.  They are influenced by, but not interested in replicating, classic '60s baroque pop, power pop and new wave. Their first band disbanded after they moved to Stockholm, where they met Eriksson in 1999 to form Peter, Björn and John. Their first gig was an unsuccessful one aboard a boat in Stockholm. Their expectations were not high from the start, as they "just wanted to make good music for [their] own amusement". Lars Skoglund of the band Laakso has filled in for the band on drums and played bongos during some live shows.

<p>After releasing the <i>Forbidden Chords</i> EP and a pair of singles ("Failing and Passing" and "I Don't Know What I Want Us to Do"), the band released its self-titled first album in 2002 on the tiny Beat That! label. After more shows, more EPs (People They Know, 100m of Hurdles), and another single ("See Through"), the group jumped to the Planekonomi label in 2004 and released the Beats, Traps and Backgrounds EP. It was soon followed by the 2004 album <i>Falling Out</i>, which was picked up for American release by Hidden Adenda in late 2005.

<p>The band's third album, <i>Writer's Block</i> (2006), followed a year later and became a minor international hit. The video to their song "Young Folks" was animated and directed by Ted Malmros from Shout Out Louds.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>After completing various tours in support of <i>Writer's Block</i>, the band focused on other projects before coming together to record and release a largely instrumental album, <i>Seaside Rock</i>, in the autumn of 2008. <i>Living Thing</i>, the band's darker, more experimental fourth full-length album, was released several months later in early 2009. Peter, Bjorn and John played Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago. In 2011, Peter Bjorn and John returned to their melodic pop roots with the decidedly more accessible <i>Gimme Some</i>. The band also opened up for Depeche Mode during their Tour of the Universe. <i>Gimme Some</i>'s second single "Second Chance" is heard prominently in advertising for the American light beer Bud Light and as the theme song for the CBS sitcom <i>2 Broke Girls</i>.

<p>The three band members are also founding members of the Swedish artist collective and record label INGRID. The band soon revealed that work had commenced on their seventh album, but were hit by creative setbacks. In April 2015, Peter Bjorn and John released their first new music in four years with one-off single "High Up (Take Me to the Top)" on <i>INGRID Volym 2</i>, a Record Store Day exclusive double-LP of which there are only 500 copies. In July of the same year, the band debuted two new songs on NPR, before officially announcing forthcoming LP <i>Breakin' Point</i> much later on 11 March 2016, along with promotional single "What You Talking About." Rolling Stone said of the single: "The band also unveiled the album's first single "What You Talking About?," an infectious slice of synth-heavy indie pop." The album was released on June 10 2016. The album's first lead single (bearing the same name as the album), "Breakin' Point" was released on 24 March 2016, following being premiered by Zane Lowe on Apple's Beats 1 Radio as the World Record.
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>In August 2018, the band announced the upcoming release of their eighth album, <i>Darker Days</i>, which was released on October 19, 2018.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Collaborations_and_solo_work">Collaborations and solo work</span></h2>
<p>Peter, Bjorn and John also collaborated with Canadian-born actor and hip-hop star Drake on his 2009 mixtape, So Far Gone, on the song "Let's Call It Off." Many rappers like Wale, GZA and 88 Keys collaborated on <i>Re-Living Thing</i>, a remix of <i>Living Thing</i>, released on 8 September 2009 by Mick Boogie.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>Morén has released three solo albums. On 8 April 2008 he released a solo album in English, <i>The Last Tycoon</i> on the Wichita Recordings and Quarterstick Records labels. In 2010, he released a solo album in Swedish, <i>I Spåren Av Tåren</i>. Most recently he released the more political Pyramiden, influenced by modern indie, new wave, and the formation of the artistic collective INGRID, of which he is a founding member.
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p><p>Björn Yttling has previously worked on jazz music and as a member of INGRID has collaborated in bands such as 'Smile' as well as pursuing his solo work as 'Yttling Jazz'. John Eriksson, having previously released three EPs under the name, has continued as a member of Ingrid to work under the name Hortlax Cobra releasing experimental electronic music. His first album, 'Night Shift', was released on the collective's record label in 2012. His second album '1984' was released in 2012.  In 2017 he released his third album "Lightworks" on INGRID.  He is also a member of the Ingrid project Starlight Serenaders.
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p><p>The group collaborated with producer Claptone, providing vocals on the track "Puppet Theatre". The song is the first single from the album <i>Charmer</i>, released in October 2015.
