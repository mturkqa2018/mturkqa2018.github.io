<p>"<b>See You Again</b>" is a song recorded by American rapper Wiz Khalifa, featuring American singer Charlie Puth. The track was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2015 action film <i>Furious 7</i> as a tribute to actor Paul Walker, who died in a single-vehicle accident on November 30, 2013 in Valencia, California. Later on, the song was included as a bonus track on the international release of Puth's debut album, <i>Nine Track Mind</i>. The artists co-wrote the song with its co-producers, DJ Frank E and Andrew Cedar, with additional production from Puth and mixing provided by Manny Marroquin. "See You Again" was released on March 10, 2015, as the soundtrack's lead single in the United States.

The song held the record for the most-streamed track in a single day on Spotify in the United States, until it was surpassed by "Drag Me Down".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_and_development">Writing and development</span></h2>
<p>"See You Again" was written by DJ Frank E, Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa, and Andrew Cedar. It was produced by DJ Frank E, Charlie Puth, and Andrew Cedar. Frank E and Puth were approached by their publishing company, Artist Publishing Group, to develop a melody that could pay tribute to the late Paul Walker for the film <i>Furious 7</i> (2015). His publishing company's president Ben Maddahi then set up a first-time studio session for Puth with DJ Frank E at a studio in Los Angeles.
<a name="text5"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></a></p><p>Puth became emotionally attached while writing the track, recalling Vail Cerullo, a friend of Puth's time at Berklee College of Music, who perished in a motorcycle accident in 2012. He was at first reluctant that the film's soundtrack label, Atlantic Records, would choose his vocal for the song. In an interview with the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Puth recalled, "It just seemed to occur from out of nowhere. And basically 10 minutes later Justin and I wrote it, we sent it off, and I thought we'd never hear about it again." Puth and DJ Frank E's output from the session was well received by <i>Furious 7</i> filmmakers, Universal Pictures, and Atlantic. As a result, the track was further commissioned to include rapped verses by Khalifa based on the subject of family, combined with Puth's vocals and a piano melody. The song then went through an extensive note-giving and production process. Puth opined that his vocal was chosen by Atlantic because of his emotional attachment to the subject matter. Puth revealed on <i>The Talk</i> that Universal originally wanted to get a more established singer to sing his part. He also revealed in one of his interviews that the song's hook was originally written for Sam Smith.
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>The song was chosen to be played at the end of the film. Following O'Conner's retirement send-off to be with his wife and family, the characters Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto drove on a mountain road and parted ways upon reaching a fork.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Synopsis">Synopsis</span></h3>
<p>The video begins with a shot of a cliff top at sunset, followed by Khalifa walking down a highway road. Puth is then shown singing the chorus whilst sitting at, and playing, a piano located between two cars. Khalifa's rap verses and Puth singing the second chorus and bridge are interspersed with footage from <i>Furious 7</i>. After the bridge, we see the final scene from the film: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Cody Walker, filling in for his brother, Paul), driving together, pull over in their cars and smile at each other one last time before driving away on separate roads into the sunset. After the camera pans up into the sky, the screen turns white, the words "For Paul" appear on screen and the video ends.
