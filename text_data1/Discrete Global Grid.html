<p>A <b>Discrete Global Grid</b> (<b>DGG</b>) is a mosaic  which covers the entire Earth's surface.
Mathematically it is a space partitioning: it consists of a set of non-empty regions that form a partition of the Earth's surface.  In a usual grid-modeling strategy, to simplify position calculations, each region is represented by a point, abstracting the grid as a set of region-points.  Each region or region-point in the grid  is called a <b>cell</b>.
<a name="text1"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></a></p><p>When each cell of a grid is subject to a recursive partition, resulting in a "series of discrete global grids with progressively finer resolution", forming a hierarchical grid, it is named <b>Hierarchical DGG</b> (sometimes "DGG system").
<a name="text2"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></a></p><p>Discrete Global Grids are used as the geometric basis for the building of geospatial data structures. Each cell is related with data objects or values, or (in the hierarchical case)  may be associated with other cells. <b>DGGs</b> have been proposed for use in a wide range of geospatial applications, including vector and raster location representation, data fusion, and spatial databases.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>The most usual grids are for horizontal position representation, using a standard  datum, like WGS84. In this context, it is common also to use a specific DGG as foundation for geocoding standardization.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>In the context of a spatial index, a DGG can assign unique identifiers to each grid cell, using it for spatial indexing purposes, in geodatabases or for geocoding.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reference_model_of_the_globe">Reference model of the globe</span></h2>
<p>The "globe", in the DGG concept, have no strict semantic; but in Geodesy a so-called "Grid Reference System" is a  grid that divides space with precise positions relative to a  datum, that is an approximated a "standard model of the Geoid".  So, in the role of Geoid, the "globe" covered by a DGG can be any of the following  objects:
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p>
<ul><li>The  <i>topographical surface</i> of the Earth, when each cell of the grid has its surface-position coordinates and the elevation in relation to the standard Geoid. Example: grid with coordinates  <i>(φ,λ,z)</i> where z is the elevation.</li>
<li>A standard <i>Geoid surface</i>. The z coordinate is zero for all grid, them can be omitted,  <i>(φ,λ)</i>. <br/>Ancient standards, before 1687  (the Newton's Principia publication), used a "reference sphere"; in nowadays the Geoid is mathematically abstracted as reference ellipsoid.
<ul><li>A <i>simplified Geoid</i>: sometimes an old geodesic standard (e.g. SAD69) or a non-geodesic surface (e. g. perfectly spherical surface) must be adopted, and will be covered by the grid. In this case, cells must be labeled with non-ambiguous way, <i>(φ',λ')</i>, and the transformation <i>(φ,λ)⟾(φ',λ')</i> must be known.</li></ul></li>
<li>A <i>projection surface</i>. Typically the geographic coordinates <i>(φ,λ)</i> are projected (with some distortion) onto the 2D mapping plane with 2D Cartesian coordinates <i>(x, y)</i>.</li></ul>
<p>As a global modeling process, modern DGGs, when including projection process, tend to avoid surfaces like cylinder or a conic solids that result in discontinuities and indexing problems. Regular polyhedra and other topological equivalents of sphere led to the most promising known options to be covered by DGGs, because "spherical projections preserve the <i>correct topology</i> of the Earth – there are no singularities or discontinuities to deal with".
<a name="text7"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></a></p><p>When working with a DGG it is important to specify which of these options was adopted. So, the characterization of the <i>reference model of the globe</i> of a DGG can be summarized by:
<a name="text8"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></a></p>
<ul><li>The recovered <b>object</b>: the object type in the role of globe. If there is no projection, the object covered by the grid is the Geoid, the Earth or a sphere; else is the geometry class of the projection surface (e.g. a cylinder, a cube or a cone).</li>
<li><b>Projection</b> type:  absent (no projection) or present. When present, its characterization can be summarized by the projection's goal property (e.g. equal-area, conformal, etc.) and the class of the corrective function (e.g. trigonometric, linear,  quadractic, etc.).</li></ul>
<p>NOTE: when the DGG is covering a projection surface, in a context of data provenance, the metadata about reference-Geoid is also important — typically informing its ISO 19111's CRS value, with no confusion with the projection surface.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_and_examples">Types and examples</span></h2>
<p>The main distinguishing feature to classify or compare DGGs is the use or not of hierarchical grid structures:
<a name="text10"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></a></p>
<ul><li>In <b>hierarchical</b> reference systems each cell is a "box reference" to a subset of cells, and cell identifiers can express this hierarchy in its numbering logic or structure.</li>
<li>In <b>non-hierarchical</b> reference systems each cell have a distinct identifier and represents a fixed-scale region of the space. The discretization of the Latitude/Longitude system  is the most popular, and the standard reference for conversions.</li></ul>
<p>Other usual criteria to classify a DGG are tile-shape and granularity (<i>grid resolution</i>):
<a name="text11"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></a></p>
<ul><li><b>Tile regularity and shape</b>:  there are regular, semi-regular  or irregular grid. As in generic tilings by regular polygons,  is possible to tiling with regular face (like wall tiles can be rectangular, triangular, hexagonal, etc.), or with same face type but changing its size or angles, resulting in semi-regular shapes. <br/>Uniformity of shape and regularity of metrics provide better grid-indexing algorithms. Although it has less practical use, totally irregular grids are possible, such in a Voronoi coverage.</li>
<li>Fine or coarse <b>granulation</b> (cell size): modern DGGs are parametrizable in its grid resolution, so, it is a characteristic of the final DGG instance, but not useful to classify DGGs, except when the DGG-type must use an specific resolution or have a discretization limit. A "fine" granulation grid is non-limited and "coarse" refers to drastic limitation. Historically the main limitations are related to digital/analogic media, the compression/expanded representations of the grid in a database, and the memory limitations to store the grid. When  a quantitative characterization is necessary, the average area of the grid cells or average distance between cell centers can be adopted.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-hierarchical_grids">Non-hierarchical grids</span></h3>
<p>The most common class of Discrete Global Grids are those that place cell center points on longitude/latitude meridians and parallels, or which use the longitude/latitude meridians and parallels to form the boundaries of rectangular cells. Examples of such grids, all based on Latitude/Longitude:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Discrete Global Grids with cell regions defined by parallels and meridians of latitude/longitude have been used since the earliest days of global geospatial computing. Before it, the discretization of continuous coordinates for practical purposes, with paper maps, occurred only with low granularity.  Perhaps the most representative and main example of DGG of this pre-digital era was the 1940s military UTM DGGs, with finner granulaed cell identification for geocoding purposes. Similarly some <i>hierarchical grid</i> exists before geospatial computing, but only in coarse granulation.
<a name="text21"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></a></p><p>A global surface is not required for use on daily geographical maps, and the memory was very expansive before the 2000s, to put all planetary data into the same computer. The first digital global grids were used for data processing of the satellite images and global (climatic and oceanographic) fluid dynamics modeling.
<a name="text22"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></a></p><p>The first published references to <i>Hierarchical Geodesic DGG</i> systems are to systems developed for atmospheric modeling and published in 1968. These systems have hexagonal cell regions created on the surface of a spherical icosahedron.


<a name="text23"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></a></p><p>The spatial hierarchical grids were subject to more intensive studies in the 1980s, when main structures, as Quadtree, were adapted in image indexing and databases.
<a name="text24"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></a></p><p>While specific instances of these grids have been in use for decades, the term <i>Discrete Global Grids</i> were coined by researchers at Oregon State University in 1997 to describe the class of all such entities.

The best choices are being selected and adapted to necessities,  propitiating the evolution of the DGG architectures. Examples of this evolution process: from  non-hierarchical to hierarchical DGGs; from the use of Z-curve indexes (a <i>naive algorithm</i> based in digits-interlacing), used by Geohash, to Hilbert-curve indexes, used in modern optimizations, like S2.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geocoding_variants">Geocoding variants</span></h2>
<p>In general each cell of the grid is identified by the coordinates of its region-point, but it is also possible to simplify the coordinate syntax and semantics, to obtain an identifier, as in a classic alphanumeric grids — and find the coordinates of a region-point from its identifier. 
Small and fast coordinate representations is a goal in the cell-ID implementations, for any DGG solutions.
<a name="text30"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></a></p><p>There is no loss of functionality when using a "free identifier" instead of a coordinate, that is, any unique number or unique symbolic label per region-point, the <b>cell ID</b>.  So, to transform a coordinate into a human-readable label, and/or compressing the length of the label, is an additional step in the grid representation.
<a name="text31"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></a></p><p>Some popular "global place codes" as ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 for administrative regions or Longhurst code for ecological regions of the globe, are <i>partial</i> in globe's coverage.  By other hand, any set of cell-identifiers of a specific DGG can be used as "full-coverage place codes". Each different set of IDs, when used as a standard for data interchange purposes, are named "geocoding system".
<a name="text32"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></a></p><p>There are many ways to represent the value of a cell identifier (<i>cell-ID</i>) of a grid: structured or monolithic, binary or not, human-readable or not. Supposing a map feature, like the Singapore's Merlion fountaine (~5m scale feature), represented by its minimum bounding cell or a center-point-cell, the <i>cell ID</i> will be:

<p>All these geocodes represents the same position in the globe,  with similar precision,  but differ in string-length, separators-use and alphabet (non-separator characters).   
In some cases the "original DGG" representation can be used. The variants are minor changes, affecting only final representation, for example the base of the numeric representation, or interlacing parts of the structured into only one number or code representation. The most popular variants are used for geocoding applications.
