<p>At his country estate, a writer matches wits with an actor who has stolen his wife's heart involving mind games and tricks.

<p>The film's screenwriter, Harold Pinter, credited as "Man on TV", is seen on a television in the background interviewing another man, played by an uncredited Kenneth Branagh. The only other person seen in the film is an uncredited actress, Carmel O'Sullivan, in the role of Maggie.

<p>The film does not use Anthony Shaffer's original dialogue; instead it uses a completely rewritten script by Harold Pinter, while retaining the basic idea. There are a few very significant changes:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<ul><li>Tindle does not pretend to murder Wyke's mistress – instead he pretends to perform the robbery he set up before (a crucial difference, as the supposed murder sets up a psychological motive for the original film's ending);</li>
<li>Wyke now tries to seduce Tindle; and</li>
<li>Wyke appears to get off scot free at the end, as opposed to the original where it is presumed that Wyke will likely be arrested. (This time his wife appears to be on her way to the house, as opposed to the police.)</li>
<li>In the original, Wyke was an aristocratic eccentric; his vehement dislike of Tindle's working-class, Italian roots was the source of much of the tension. This is not the case in this version.</li>
<li>Tindle is an impoverished actor, rather than a wealthy hairdressing-salon owner.</li></ul>
<p>The 2007 version is nearly an hour shorter than the 1972 version.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>Caine had starred as hairdresser Milo Tindle opposite Laurence Olivier's novelist Andrew Wyke in the 1972 film <i>Sleuth</i>, with each being nominated for an Academy Award for their performance. In the 2007 film, Caine took the role of Wyke, and Law took Caine's role of Tindle.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>This was the second time Law performed a film character originated by Caine, the first having been the title role of <i>Alfie</i>. Caine himself had previously starred in two different roles for two versions of <i>Get Carter</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>According to many accounts, this set out to be a remake of the 1972 version, but Pinter's screenplay-offered "a fresh take" on Shaffer's play and "a very different form" from the original film.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In his review of the film's debut at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, Roderick Conway Morris observed: "The reworking of the play is not just an adept transformation of theatre to film ... but also casts a revealing light on social history, reflecting the enormous changes in English society, language and morals in the nearly 40 years since the play first appeared on the London stage."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The screenwriter, actors and director insisted that this <i>Sleuth</i> was not a "remake." Law called it "a completely reinvented <i>Sleuth</i>... It didn't feel like a remake. I always loved the idea at its heart of two men battling it out for a woman you never meet." Law further felt that he "was creating a character (Tindle), I wasn't recreating one." Caine said, "I never felt that I had gone back to <i>Sleuth</i>." He called the Pinter script "an entirely different thing. There isn't a single line in it that was in the other one, and Pinter had never seen the [1972] movie. Jude [Law] gave him the stage play and said, 'Write a screenplay for me' ... It was a completely different experience." In a television interview conducted on RAI TV during the Venice International Film Festival, Caine stated: "If the script hadn't been by Harold Pinter, I wouldn't have done the movie."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Pinter said, "It's a totally new take...I had not either seen or read the play, and I hadn't seen the film adapted from the play either, so I knew nothing about it. So I simply read the play and I think it's totally transformed. I've kept one or two plot things because you have to but apart from that, I think I've made it my own."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Caine stated, "The first <i>Sleuth</i> I thought was great and the second <i>Sleuth</i> I thought was great until I read the reviews. I said to Pinter, 'What film did they show them?' I have a feeling that [the new] <i>Sleuth</i> will be rediscovered some day."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Claustrophobia">Claustrophobia</span></h3>
<p>Manohla Dargis of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote a review headlined "A Dance of Two Men, Twisting and Turning With a Gun That's More Than a Gun."  In contrast to Sarah Lyall's <i>New York Times</i> preview, Dargis wrote that she did not like watching the film, finding it too claustrophobic: "Mr. Branagh fiddles with the lights, tilts the camera and hustles his hard-working actors upstairs and down and back again and into an elevator as small as a coffin built for one. He embellishes the screenplay’s every obvious conceit and word, hammering the point until you feel as if you’re trapped inside the elevator with Milo and Andrew, going up and down and up and down, though nowhere in particular."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In his interview with Martin A. Grove, Branagh mentions that the danger of inducing  claustrophobia in audience members is a risk that he took into account in filming <i>Sleuth</i>: "What Branagh didn't do that many Hollywood directors would have done is to open the film up by, for instance, having the two men drive to a nearby pub at some point in their conversation. 'Well, it's interesting you say that,' he told [Grove], 'There were discussions about that, but we said, 'If we believe in the power of the writing here and the power of the performances, but also, frankly, if we believe in the audience and believe that the audience can find this as fascinating as I do on the pages and if we can realize it to meet all of their expectations then the claustrophobia (won't be a problem).' "
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_House">The House</span></h3>
<p>Director Branagh found shooting in the house difficult yet interesting. “The minimalism I found was a great challenge. The elevator was Harold's idea, so that was there and was a central feature of what we are going to bring to it. And then everything else was drawn from contemporary British architecture, contemporary British artists. The wire figure is by Anthony Gormley, one of our most famous sculptors. Gary Hume did all the artwork on the walls." Custom designed furniture from Ron Arad completes the look.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Screenings">Screenings</span></h3>
<p>After premiering at the 64th Venice Film Festival on 30 August 2007, <i>Sleuth</i> was screened at the Toronto Film Festival on 10 September 2007. It was also screened at the Atlantic Film Festival, in Halifax, on 22 September 2007, the Aspen FilmFest on 26 September 2007, the Copenhagen International Film Festival, on 27 September 2007, the Calgary International Film Festival, in Alberta, on 28 September 2007 and the Haifa International Film Festival on 1 October 2007.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>On 3 and 4 October 2007, <i>Sleuth</i> was screened at <i>Variety’s 2007 Screening Series</i> in New York, at the Chelsea West Cinemas, and in Los Angeles, at the ArcLight Theatre. Kenneth Branagh, Michael Caine and Jude Law made interviews on the television programs <i>The Today Show</i>, RAI TV, <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, <i>The Charlie Rose Show</i>, and <i>Reel Talk</i> with Jeffrey Lyons.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h2>
<p>The film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes gives the movie a 36%. Of 118 reviews, 42 were "Fresh" (positive) and 76 "Rotten" (negative). The critical consensus states  that "Sleuth is so obvious and coarse, rather than suspenseful and action-packed, that it does nothing to improve on the original version."

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p><i>Time</i> film reviewer Richard Corliss indicated he was not pleased with the outcome, concluding, "...[I]f you consider what the exalted quartet of Branagh, Pinter, Caine and Law might have done with the project, and what they did <i>to</i> it, <i>Sleuth</i> has to be the worst prestige movie of the year."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Claudia Puig of <i>USA Today</i> was more appreciative, writing, "Caine and Law are in fine form bantering cleverly in this entertaining cat-and-mouse game, thanks to the inspired dialogue of Harold Pinter. They parry, using witticisms instead of swords. Then they do a dance of deception, a veritable tango. There's thievery, peril and plenty of double-crossing. (...) As directed by Kenneth Branagh, this new version is darker and more claustrophobic. In the original the house where all the action took place was Gothic and laden with gewgaws. The new domicile is stark and minimalist, and much more threatening. Branagh's version has more incipient horror and less camp."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Roger Ebert of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> wrote, "It's no mystery that 'Sleuth' is fascinating," observing that Pinter "has written a new country house mystery, which is not really a mystery at all in terms of its plot, and eerily impenetrable in its human relationship" and that "in 'Sleuth' what [Kenneth Branagh] celebrates is perplexing, ominous, insinuating material in the hands of two skilled actors." In contrast, J.R. Jones of <i>The Chicago Reader</i> wrote, "Director Kenneth Branagh has mercifully pared the action down to 88 minutes (the first movie dragged on for 138), but the final act, with its obscure homosexual flirtation, still seems to go on forever."
