<h3><span id="Utah.2FUS_Film_Festival"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Utah/US_Film_Festival">Utah/US Film Festival</span></h3>
<p>Sundance began in Salt Lake City in August 1978, as the Utah/US Film Festival in an effort to attract more filmmakers to Utah. It was founded by Sterling Van Wagenen (then head of Wildwood, Robert Redford's company), John Earle (serving on the Utah Film Commission at the time). The 1978 festival featured films such as <i>Deliverance</i>, <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>, <i>Mean Streets</i>, and <i>The Sweet Smell of Success</i>.
With chairman Robert Redford, and the help of Utah Governor Scott M. Matheson, the goal of the festival was to showcase strictly American-made films, highlight the potential of independent film, and to increase visibility for filmmaking in Utah. At the time, the main focus of the event was to conduct a competition for independent American films, present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions, and to celebrate the Frank Capra Award. The festival also highlighted the work of regional filmmakers who worked outside the Hollywood system.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The jury of the 1978 festival was headed by Gary Allison, and included Verna Fields, Linwood G. Dunn, Katharine Ross, Charles E. Sellier Jr., Mark Rydell, and Anthea Sylbert.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 1979, Sterling Van Wagenen left to head up the first-year pilot program of what was to become the Sundance Institute, and James W. (Jim) Ure took over briefly as executive director, followed by Cirina Hampton Catania as executive director. More than 60 films were screened at the festival that year, and panels featured many well-known Hollywood filmmakers. Also that year, the first Frank Capra Award went to Jimmy Stewart. The festival also made a profit for the first time. In 1980, Catania left the festival to pursue a production career in Hollywood.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Several factors helped propel the growth of Utah/US Film Festival. First was the involvement of actor and Utah resident Robert Redford, who became the festival's inaugural chairman. By having Redford's name associated with the festival, it received great attention. Secondly, the country was hungry for more venues that would celebrate American-made films as the only other festival doing so at the time was the USA Film Festival in Dallas (est. 1971). Response in Hollywood was unprecedented, as major studios did all they could to contribute their resources.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In 1981, the festival moved to Park City, Utah, and changed the dates from September to January. The move from late summer to midwinter was done by the executive director Susan Barrell with the cooperation of Hollywood director Sydney Pollack, who suggested that running a film festival in a ski resort during winter would draw more attention from Hollywood. It was called the US Film and Video Festival.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Change_to_Sundance">Change to Sundance</span></h3>
<p>In 1984, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival. Gary Beer and Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural US Film Festival presented by Sundance Institute (1985), which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby. The branding and marketing transition from the US Film Festival to the Sundance Film Festival was managed under the direction of Colleen Allen, Allen Advertising Inc., by appointment of Robert Redford. In 1991, the festival was officially renamed the Sundance Film Festival, after Redford's character the Sundance Kid from the film <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>.

<p>UK-based publisher C21 Media first revealed in October 2010 that Robert Redford was planning to bring the Sundance Film Festival to London, and in March the following year, Redford officially announced that Sundance London would be held at The O2, in London from 26–29 April 2012; the first time it has traveled outside the US.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In a press statement, Redford said, "We are excited to partner with AEG Europe to bring a particular slice of American culture to life in the inspired setting of The O2, and in this city of such rich cultural history. [...] It is our mutual goal to bring to the UK, the very best in current American independent cinema, to introduce the artists responsible for it, and in essence help build a picture of our country that is broadly reflective of the diversity of voices not always seen in our cultural exports."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The majority of the film screenings, including the festival's premieres, would be held within the Cineworld cinema at The O2 entertainment district. The 2013 Sundance London Festival was held 25–28 April 2013, and sponsored by car-maker Jaguar.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Sundance London 2014 took place on 25–27 April 2014 at the O2 arena. The Sundance London 2015 Festival was cancelled in an announcement on 16 January 2015. Sundance London returned to London from 2–5 June 2016 and again 1–4 June 2017, both at Picturehouse Cinema in London's West End.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sundance_at_BAM">Sundance at BAM</span></h3>
<p>From 2006 through 2008, Sundance Institute collaborated with the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) on a special series of film screenings, performances, panel discussions, and special events bringing the institute's activities and the festival's programming to New York City.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Notability_of_festivals">Notability of festivals</span></h3>
<p>Many notable independent filmmakers received their big break at Sundance, including Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, Todd Field, David O. Russell, Steve James, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, Darren Aronofsky, James Wan, Edward Burns, and Jim Jarmusch. The festival is also responsible for bringing wider attention to such films as <i>Saw</i>, <i>Garden State</i>, <i>Super Troopers</i>, <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>, <i>Spanking the Monkey</i>, <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>, <i>Primer</i>, <i>In the Bedroom</i>, <i>Better Luck Tomorrow</i>, <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>, <i>Donnie Darko</i>, <i>El Mariachi</i>, <i>Moon</i>, <i>Clerks</i>, <i>Thank You for Smoking</i>, <i>Sex, Lies, and Videotape</i>, <i>The Brothers McMullen</i>, <i>(500) Days of Summer</i>, <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i>, <i>Whiplash, Boyhood,</i> and <i>Get Out</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p><i>Three Seasons</i> was the first in festival history to ever receive both the Grand Jury Award and Audience Award, in 1999. Later films that won both awards are: <i>God Grew Tired of Us</i> in 2006 (documentary category), <i>Quinceañera</i> in 2006 (dramatic category), <i>Precious</i> in 2009, <i>Fruitvale</i> (later retitled <i>Fruitvale Station</i>) in 2013, <i>Whiplash</i> in 2014, <i>Me and Earl and the Dying Girl</i> in 2015, and <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> in 2016.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>At the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, three films went on to garner eight Oscar nominations. <i>Manchester by the Sea</i> took the lead in Sundance-supported films with six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. The next year, about 40 films were acquired by distributors, among them including Amazon, Netflix, Lionsgate, and Universal.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Growth_of_the_festival">Growth of the festival</span></h3>
<p>The festival has changed over the decades from a low-profile venue for small-budget, independent creators from outside the Hollywood system to a media extravaganza for Hollywood celebrity actors, paparazzi, and luxury lounges set up by companies not affiliated with Sundance. Festival organizers have tried curbing these activities in recent years, beginning in 2007 with their ongoing Focus On Film campaign.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>The 2009 film <i>Official Rejection</i> documented the experience of small filmmakers trying to get into various festivals in the late 2000s, including Sundance. The film contained several arguments that Sundance had become dominated by large studios and sponsoring corporations. A contrast was made between the 1990s, in which non-famous filmmakers with tiny budget films could get distribution deals from studios like Miramax Films or New Line Cinema, (like Kevin Smith's <i>Clerks</i>), and the 2000s, when major stars with multimillion-dollar films (like <i>The Butterfly Effect</i> with Ashton Kutcher) dominated the festival. Kevin Smith doubted that <i>Clerks</i>, if made in the late 2000s, would be accepted to Sundance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Numerous small festivals sprung up around Sundance in the Park City area, including Slamdance, Nodance, Slumdance, It-dance, X-Dance, Lapdance, Tromadance, The Park City Film Music Festival, etc., though all except Slamdance are no longer held.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Included in the Sundance changes made in 2010, a new programming category titled "NEXT" (often denoted simply by the characters "&lt;=&gt;", which mean "less is more") was introduced to showcase innovative films that are able to transcend the confines of an independent budget. Another recent addition was the Sundance Film Festival USA program, in which eight of the festival's films are shown in eight different theaters around the United States.
