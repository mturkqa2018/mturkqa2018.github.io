<p>On September 13, 2011, it was announced that Sumpter would be playing one of the sisters, Deloris, in the music-themed film <i>Sparkle</i> alongside Jordin Sparks, Whitney Houston, Derek Luke and Carmen Ejogo. <i>Sparkle</i> is a remake of the <i>1976 film of the same name</i> inspired by the story of The Supremes. The remake was set in 1968 Detroit, during the rise of Motown. The story focused on the youngest sister, a music prodigy named Sparkle Williams (Jordin Sparks), and her struggle to become a star while overcoming issues that are tearing her family apart. R&amp;B singer Aaliyah was originally planned to star as Sparkle; however following her death in a 2001 plane crash, production on the film stopped. Production would have begun in 2002. <i>Sparkle</i> was filmed in the fall of 2011 over a two-month period. The film, which co-stars Sumpter, was released in the United States on August 17, 2012. On May 21, 2012, "Celebrate", the last song Whitney Houston recorded with Sparks, premiered at RyanSeacrest.com. The song is the first official single featured on the <i>Sparkle: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</i> album which Sumpter is a part of. The accompanying music video for Celebrate was filmed on May 30, 2012 and the video featured herself and the rest of her <i>Sparkle</i> cast mates .

In same year, Sumpter began starring as Candace Young, a lead villainess, in the Oprah Winfrey Network soapy drama series <i>The Haves and the Have Nots</i>, also created by Tyler Perry. The series received negative reviews from critics, like other of Perry's works, but was the biggest hit in ratings for Oprah Winfrey Network, to date.

<h3><span id="2016.E2.80.93present"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="2016â€“present">2016â€“present</span></h3>

She received positive reviews for her performance. <i>Variety</i> placed her in its list of one of the "Biggest Breakthrough Performances" at Sundance, writing in its review, "Itâ€™s a tall order to bring a living, breathing icon to life. But thatâ€™s just what Sumpter does, checking in with Americaâ€™s First Lady before she ever landed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Playing Michelle Robinson when she was just an up-and-coming corporate lawyer, Sumpter slowly lets her guard down, allowing an idealistic Barack Obama to charm her into going to an art show, a community gathering and a Spike Lee film."
