<p><i><b>Total Drama World Tour</b></i> is the third season of the <i>Total Drama</i> franchise that began with <i>Total Drama Island</i> and <i>Total Drama Action</i>. The series extension was commissioned by Teletoon from the producers, Fresh TV, Inc. The season's elements and plot structure is largely based on <i>The Amazing Race</i>, with the semi-final episode being a direct parody of the reality series.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>In this series, fifteen returning contestants and two new contestants are taken on a trip around the world, and compete in cultural themed challenges of countries they visit. An added twist in this season is that they are required to break spontaneously into song, or else be immediately eliminated. The original cast from this and past seasons do not compete in the next season, <i>Total Drama: Revenge of the Island</i>, as there is a new cast. However, nine of these original contestants each have a cameo in the next season, while seven of them return to compete again in the fifth season, <i>Total Drama All-Stars</i>. This series is rated TV-PG-D in the United States and Australia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>A spin-off series based on this season, <i>The Ridonculous Race</i>, premiered in September 2015.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>As with the previous seasons, fifteen returning contestants and three new ones (Alejandro, Sierra, and Blaineley) partake in an elimination-based competition for the grand prize of C$1,000,000, led by series host Chris McLean (Christian Potenza).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In this season, contestants are taken around the world throughout international based challenges and are required to break into song whenever Chris rings a special chime, or face instant elimination. There are 30 songs in total, and every episode takes place in a different location.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>As the contestants are eliminated, they take the "Drop of Shame" by parachuting out of the plane in which the elimination ceremonies take place. When eliminated, they lose the chance at the million dollars (though such an elimination may not be permanent) and are forced to be sent home.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The winner of <i>Total Drama World Tour</i> is Alejandro in Canada, while Heather is the runner-up. However, in the American version and iTunes version, Heather is the winner. Beth, Eva, Geoff, Justin, Katie, Sadie, and Trent do not return to compete; instead, they appear on the aftermath special, sitting in the peanut gallery and on the last episode while cheering for the finalists, Alejandro and Heather.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>However, as stated multiple times in following seasons, there was never any clear winner, as the money was thrown into a volcano by Ezekiel, making the money burn into ashes. This is the second season (first being <i>Total Drama Island</i>) in the series where no contestant wins anything.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>This season's entire plot structure and elements is expanded into a related series called <i>Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</i> which aired in 2015. This series also takes place around the world and also features eighteen competitors (teams) like <i>Total Drama World Tour</i>, however whereas World Tour was still organized like <i>Survivor</i>, <i>The Ridonculous Race</i> was based on <i>The Amazing Race</i>.

She is obsessed with gossip and fame, and wants more than anything to obtain a "juicy" story and attempts to delve into topics that could potentially cause a scandal. Prior to <i>World Tour</i>, she co-hosted the show <i>Celebrity Manhunt</i> with Josh as featured on the <i>Total Drama Action</i> special. On <i>Aftermath</i>, she demonstrates she is conceited, mean, and willing to do whatever it takes to remain in the spotlight, which led her to clash with the other two co-hosts, Bridgette and Geoff. When she takes it too far by kidnapping Bridgette and sending her to Siberia, Geoff gets his revenge by making Blaineley a contestant in <i>World Tour</i>.

Despite his intentions, he ends up being voted off first once again, but manages to grab hold of the wings and hide on the plane cargo to secretly stay in the competition. Over time, this has a drastic effect on his humanity and sanity, greatly altering his physical appearance into a green, clawed, bald, crazy, and deformed creature who is no longer capable of speaking and attacks anybody he considers a threat.

<p>The season began production in 2009 when Fresh TV Inc. told Teletoon to order new <i>Total Drama</i> episodes for an upcoming third season. This season was to be called <i>Total Drama: The Musical</i> when it first entered production. Keith Oliver and Chad Hicks directed this new season while two new voice actors, Marco Grazzini and Annick Obonsawin had to be hired if they wanted to voice the two new characters, Alejandro and Sierra. The season's title was later changed to the current title, <i>Total Drama World Tour</i> in 2010 upon the airing of Celebrity Manhunt's Total Drama Action Reunion Special due to the singing no longer being the main focus for this season.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Episode_finale_variations">Episode finale variations</span></h3>
<p>The show's producers create two alternate endings for the final episode, such that the winner seen in one country's broadcasts is the runner-up in other countries (and vice versa) where the show airs. Heather was shown as the first winner when Australia aired the season for the first time worldwide. Heather was also depicted as the winner in airings from Bulgaria , Brazil, Catalonia, France, Israel, Italy, Latin America, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, and in the United States. Canada then aired Alejandro as the winner, which was later aired in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, and in Sweden.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Awards_and_accolades">Awards and accolades</span></h3>
<p><i>Total Drama World Tour</i> won numerous awards in 2011, from such outlets as the ToonZone Awards and the KidScreen Awards. At the ToonZone Awards, it won "Best Foreign Series," "Best Music Score on a TV Series," and "Best Voice Actress" for Annick Obonsawin. It was additionally nominated for "Best Original Song" for <i>Oh My Izzy</i> (sung by Scott McCord and Megan Fahlenbock), and "Best Voice Actor" for Carter Hayden. In the 2011 KidScreen Awards, the season won "Best Animated Series," "Best Voice Talent," and "Best Tweens/Teens Program."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h3>
<p>Despite the many accolades and the enormous critical acclaim, some events of this season were severely criticized, such as the under-use of characters who had smaller roles in the preceding seasons, and the overuse of characters who had already won a preceding season or, at the very least, made it far into them. Other aspects of the season that had a negative reception were Ezekiel being turned into a feral monster, the constant losing streak of Team Victory and the love triangle between Duncan, Courtney and Gwen. The love triangle was eventually addressed in a video with the show's creators on Christian Potenza's YouTube channel, revealing that the breaking up of Duncan and Courtney was actually a network request, rather than a decision on the creator's part. <i>Total Drama World Tour</i> currently holds a 7.8 on Metacritic, which indicates "generally favorable reviews."

<p>Teletoon hosted a <i>Total Drama World Tour</i> based website starting in 2010 called <i>Total Drama Online</i> where people could play games and earn badges to win prizes, but was only available in Canada. The site was then replaced with universal games available to everyone in 2013, but removed all special features from the site.
