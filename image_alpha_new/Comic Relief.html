<p><b>Comic Relief</b> is an operating British charity, founded in 1985 by the comedy scriptwriter Richard Curtis and comedian Lenny Henry in response to famine in Ethiopia. The highlight of Comic Relief's appeal is <b>Red Nose Day</b>, a biennial telethon held in March, alternating with its sister project Sport Relief.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>A prominent biennial event in British popular culture, Comic Relief is one of the two high-profile telethon events held in the United Kingdom, the other being Children in Need, held annually in November. At the end of the 2015 Red Nose Day telethon on 14 March it was announced that in the 30-year history of Comic Relief the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief appeals had raised in excess of £1 billion.

<p>Comic Relief was launched live on Noel Edmonds' <i>Late, Late Breakfast Show</i> on BBC1, on Christmas Day 1985 from a refugee camp in Sudan. The idea for Comic Relief came from the charity worker Jane Tewson, who established it as the operating name of Charity Projects, a registered charity in England and Scotland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>On 4 April 1986 the inaugural live fund-raising show, "Comic Relief Utterly Utterly Live", was staged at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London featuring popular alternative comedians and pop stars (including Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, Lenny Henry, Kate Bush and Cliff Richard).  An audio recording was released on WEA which included a live performance of the charity single "Living Doll" by Cliff Richard and the Young Ones.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The highlight of Comic Relief is Red Nose Day. On 8 February 1988, Lenny Henry went to Ethiopia and celebrated the very first Red Nose Day Telethon. Over 150 celebrities and comedians participated. The event raised 15 million British pounds sterling and attracted 30 million television viewers on BBC1. To date, Richard Curtis and Lenny Henry are still active participants of the Red Nose Day Telethon which continues to raise funds for numerous charities that help children in need and tackle worldwide poverty.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The charity states that its aim is to "bring about positive and lasting change in the lives of poor and disadvantaged people, which we believe requires investing in work that addresses people's immediate needs as well as tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>One of the fundamental principles behind working at Comic Relief is the "Golden Pound Principle" where every single donated pound (£) is spent on charitable projects. All operating costs, such as staff salaries, are covered by corporate sponsors, or interest earned on money waiting to be distributed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Currently, its main supporters are the BBC, BT, Sainsbury's supermarket chain and British Airways.  The BBC is responsible for the live television extravaganza on <i>Red Nose Day</i>; BT provides the telephony, and Sainsbury's sells merchandise on behalf of the charity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The July 2010 accounts for charity registration 326568 show grant payments of £59 million, net assets of £135 million, with an investment portfolio held in a range of managed pooled funds and fixed term deposits. The average full-time staff was 214, with 14 staff paid over £60,000 with remuneration for the year, excluding pensions, for Kevin Cahill, chief executive of £120,410.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 2002, Comic Relief and BBC Sport teamed up to create Sport Relief, a new initiative, aiming to unite the sporting community and culminate in a night of sport, entertainment and fund-raising on BBC One. Sport Relief is a biennial charity event, and the campaign deliberately alternates years with Red Nose Day, Comic Relief's flagship event.  Red Nose Day occurs in odd-numbered years, and Sport Relief in even-numbered years.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In 2009, Comic Relief launched a website calling for a financial transaction tax, the "Robin Hood" tax.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>At the end of the 2015 Red Nose Day telethon on 14 March  it was announced that in the 30-year history of Comic Relief the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief appeals had raised in excess of £1bn (£1,047,083,706).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="On_television">On television</span></h2>
<p>The television programming begins in the afternoon, with CBBC having various related reports, money raising events and celebrity gunging.  This is all in-between the regular programmes, but after the six o'clock news, the normal BBC One schedule is suspended at 7 pm in favour of a live show, with a break at 10 pm for the regular news programme.  Whilst the BBC News at Ten is aired on BBC One, Comic Relief continues on BBC Two, and then resumes on BBC One at 10:35 pm, with each hour overseen by a different celebrity team.  These celebrities do the work for free, as do the crew, with studio space and production facilities donated by the BBC.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Regular themes throughout the shows include parodies of recent popular shows, films and clips, events, and specially filmed versions of comedy shows. <i>Smith and Jones</i>, and a parody sketch starring Rowan Atkinson are both regularly featured.

<p>Various items of merchandise have been sold to promote and raise money for Comic Relief. In 1991, <i>The Totally Stonking, Surprisingly Educational And Utterly Mindboggling Comic Relief Comic</i> was published by Fleetway. Conceived, plotted and edited by Neil Gaiman, Richard Curtis, Grant Morrison and Peter K. Hogan, it featured contributions from a vast array of British comics talent, including Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Dave Gibbons, Mark Millar, Simon Bisley, Mark Buckingham, Steve Dillon, D'Israeli, Jamie Hewlett and Bryan Talbot. (Alan Moore, arguably Britain's most famous comics writer, was not credited as working on the book having sworn never to work for Fleetway again, but was said to have worked with partner Melinda Gebbie on her pages.) The comic was unique in that it featured appearances by characters from across the spectrum of comics publishers, including Marvel and DC superheroes, <i>Beano</i>, <i>Dandy</i>, <i>Eagle</i> and <i>Viz</i> characters, <i>Doctor Who</i>, the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, in addition to a cavalcade of British comedy figures (both real and fictional).  These were all linked by the twin framing narratives of the Comic Relief night itself, and the tale of "Britain's meanest man" Sir Edmund Blackadder being persuaded to donate money to the event. The comic "sold out in minutes", raising over £40,000 for the charity, and is now a highly prized collectors' item. Comic Relief have also sold Fairtrade Cotton Socks from a number of vendors. This is mainly for their Sport Relief charity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>In 1993 a computer platform game was released, called <i>Sleepwalker</i>. The game featured voice overs from Lenny Henry and Harry Enfield, and several other references to Comic Relief and tomatoes; the theme for the 1993 campaign.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>In 2001 J. K. Rowling wrote two books for Comic Relief based on her famous Harry Potter series, entitled <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i> and <i>Quidditch Through the Ages</i>. The Fantastic Beasts book, would ultimately lead to the mid-late 2010s series of films of the same name as part of the expanded "Potterverse".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>In 2007, Walkers complemented the usual merchandise by adding their own take on the red nose, promoting red ears instead. The large ears, dubbed 'Walk-ears', are based on a very old joke involving the actual ears of ex-footballer Gary Lineker, who has fronted their ad campaign since the early 1990s. Walkers previously promoted the charity in 2005, making four limited edition unusual crisp flavours.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>The 2007 game for Red Nose Day, "Let It Flow", could be played online.  This game was developed by Matmi, worldwide viral marketeers, and set in the African wilderness. Mischievous hyenas had messed up the water irrigation system which fed the crops. You had to help re-arrange the pipes to let the water flow to the crops to keep them alive.  Once the pipes were arranged, you needed to operate the elephant's trunk to pump the water through the water pipes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>For the 2007 campaign Andrex, known for their ad campaign fronted by a Labrador puppy, gave away toy puppies with red noses.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>As a Supporting Partner Jackpotjoy has launched two Red Nose Day Games for Red Nose Day 2011.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Red_nose">Red nose</span></h3>
<p>The most prominent symbol of Comic Relief is a plastic/foam "red nose", which is given in various supermarkets and charity shops such as Oxfam in exchange for a donation to the charity and to make others laugh.  People are encouraged to wear the noses on Red Nose Day to help raise awareness of the charity.  The design of the nose has been changed each year, beginning with a fairly plain one, which later grew arms, turned into a tomato and even changed colour. This regular re-design was in part to stop people from re-using previous years designs, and having to buy the latest version, as for example  some people may re-use the same Poppy, repeatedly, rather than buying a new one each year.  In 2007, the red nose was made of foam; this was to facilitate the "growing" of the nose (by rolling it in the user's hands) to keep in line with that year's tagline, <i>The Big One</i> (see the table below).  Larger noses are also available and are designed to be attached to the fronts of cars, buildings and, in 2009, a 6-metre (20-foot) diameter inflatable nose was attached to the DFDS Seaways cruiseferry <i>King of Scandinavia</i>.  However, the nose's material used for buildings was classed as a fire hazard and was banned from the <i>Comic Relief Does Fame Academy</i> shows.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chronology_of_noses">Chronology of noses</span></h4>
<p>As of 2019, Comic Relief has sold 50 different red noses over 17 Red Nose Days. Two noses were available for the 1995 event. Three noses per event were available from 2009 to 2013. In 2015, nine noses were released, and in 2017, there were 10 different noses available—for both these years, this included a rare collector's nose. For 2019, 11 different noses are available to buy, including "rare" and "ultra-rare" noses.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Chronology_of_car_noses">Chronology of car noses</span></h4>
<p>A selection of Red Nose Day "car noses" have been produced over the years, to show support for the charity while out on the road. They have traditionally been a curved nose which attaches to the car's radiator grille. In 2009, this was replaced with a magnetic design owing to safety concerns. The original grill-attachable design returned for 2011, for the first time since 1999.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Charity_singles">Charity singles</span></h2>
<p>In April 1986 the first Comic Relief charity record was released. It featured Cliff Richard and the cast of <i>The Young Ones</i> in a rendition of "Living Doll".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>Some of the money raised from the sale of each single is donated to Comic Relief. Normally a song is released just before the official Red Nose Day. There have been exceptions, such as "(I want to be) Elected" which was released to coincide with the 1992 UK general election. Before 1995's song, they were all more-or-less comedy records, mostly involving an actual band or singer, and a comedy group. From 1995 on, they have been generally more serious, although the videos still feature comical moments.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">63</span></p><p>2003 saw a return to the format of old. From 2005 to 2011, two comic relief songs were released each Red Nose Day, a song by a mainstream artist, and a comedy song.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p><p>In 1991, a music video was created called <i>Helping Hands</i> which included numerous children's TV puppet personalities, including characters from 'The House of Gristle', 'Fraggle Rock', 'Rainbow', 'Roland Rat', 'Thunderbirds', 'Round the Bend', 'Bill &amp; Ben', 'The Gophers', 'Spitting Image', 'Jim Hensons Tale of the Bunny Picnic' and more.  The song was never released.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><p>The best-selling Comic Relief single is Tony Christie and Peter Kay’s "Is This the Way to Amarillo", with 1.28 million copies sold. Westlife's 2001 cover of Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl" is the second biggest-seller, followed by 1986's "Living Dolls" and the Spice Girls' 1997 double-A side single "Mama"/"Who Do You Think You Are", with Boyzone's 1999 cover of "When the Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going" rounding up the top five.

<p>In addition, the first Red Nose Day Schools' song ('Make Someone Happy') was published in 2007.  A CD of the song, together with backing tracks and fundraising ideas was sent free of charge to all primary schools in the UK in February by the education music publisher 'Out of the Ark Music'.  Schools will be free to use the song in assemblies, singathons, or other fundraising activities.  A second Red Nose Day Song has been released for every school in the UK to use free of charge.  It can be downloaded from the Red Nose Day 09 website, or watched on YouTube, and a copy is being sent to every primary school in the UK.  It has again been published by "Out of the Ark" music, and contains a more upbeat melody than the 2007 song.  It was recorded at Hook Studios, Hook, Surrey, by the Out of the Ark Choir, which is completely made up of children.  The children in the video wear Stella McCartney's special edition Comic Relief T-shirts, and has been filmed in black and white so only the red stands out.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticisms">Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>There has been some concern about the lack of gender equality in the causes supported by Comic Relief, with much funding going to politicised women's charities or charities focusing on females. Writing in <i>The Spectator</i> Ross Clark raised the question, "why do all these women's charities ... feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the pratfest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public?" He added, "are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous?"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">68</span></p><p>The British Stammering Association criticised comedian Lenny Henry for his opening sketch for the 2011 Comic Relief, during which he spoofed the film <i>The King's Speech</i> and grew impatient with Colin Firth's portrayal of King George VI as he stammered over his speech. <i>The Sun</i> reported that the British Stammering Association had branded the sketch as "a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else's misfortune".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">69</span></p><p>In December 2013 a BBC Panorama programme pointed out that between 2007 and 2009 millions of pounds donated to Comic Relief had been invested in funds which appeared "to contradict several of its core aims", with shares in tobacco, alcohol and arms firms.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">70</span></p><p>The 2017 event was negatively received by viewers with many criticising it for its various technical problems, poor sound, unfunny sketches and inappropriate jokes such as comedian Russell Brand yelling 'Fucking Hell' after the broadcast cut off due to a technical fault, two sketches shown before the 9pm watershed; one in which comedian Vic Reeves shows a fake penis at Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid and another in which actor Brendan O'Carroll, playing his character Agnes Brown, shows the V sign and a scene in which presenter Graham Norton asks model Cara Delevingne why she had sex on a plane. However, the Carpool Karaoke and Red Nose Day Actually sketches and an appearance from singer Ed Sheeran were favourably received. The video featuring Sheeran meeting and rescuing a child in Liberia for Comic Relief had been criticised as "poverty porn" and was given the "Rusty Radiator" award for the "most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">71</span></p><p>In February 2019, David Lammy criticised Stacey Dooley for posting on social media about her trip to Uganda for Comic Relief, saying that "the world does not need any more white saviours", and that she was "perpetuating 'tired and unhelpful stereotypes' about Africa".  The remarks by Lammy were believed to have damaged the year's coverage of Red Nose Day; viewership dropped and the donations received for the broadcast in March 2019 fell by £8 million and the money raised that year was the lowest since 2007, a fall some have blamed on Lammy.

<ul><li><b>United States</b>: In 2015, Red Nose Day was formally brought to the United States under the auspices of Comic Relief, Inc., an organization unrelated to the defunct Comic Relief USA. The 2015 <i>Red Nose Day Special</i> aired on NBC on May 21, 2015 and was hosted by David Duchovny, Seth Meyers and Jane Krakowski, raising $23 million. The 2016 NBC special aired May 26 with Craig Ferguson as the host. Sponsored by Walgreens, Red Nose Day has since become an annual event.</li>
<li>Inspired by the British charity, a United States Comic Relief charity was founded in 1986 by Bob Zmuda. Comic Relief was an irregularly held event, televised on Home Box Office (HBO), which has raised and distributed nearly US$50 million toward providing health care services to homeless people throughout the United States. Comedians Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg were hosts of the event. The 1989 HBO Comic Relief show debuted the song "Mr. President", written by Joe Sterling, Ray Reach and Mike Loveless. The song was sung by Al Jarreau and Natalie Cole. On 18 November 2006, the event was revived as a fundraiser for those affected by Hurricane Katrina, and was simulcast on TBS. Richard Curtis also created the Idol Gives Back special for <i>American Idol</i>, which follows the same basic premise as Comic Relief, with specially filmed shorts, performances and footage of the stars of the show visiting impoverished countries.</li>
<li><b>Australia:</b> In 1988, the Red Nose Day concept was adopted by the SIDS and Kids organisation to help raise funds for research into sudden infant death syndrome.  Since then, Red Nose Day in Australia is held annually on the last Friday of June. An Australian version of Comic Relief, Comic Relief Australia, has also been set up. It plans to divide the money raised between Australian causes (at least 40%) and overseas charities largely in Asia Pacific (at least 40%). Following a campaign encouraging people to buy articles such as red wristbands, the first telethon-style event was held on 6 November 2005 on the Seven Network. It followed the established format, with comedy interspersed with examples of the sorts of charities to benefit. According to its website, this raised over A$800,000. Another telethon was broadcast on 27 November 2006 on Seven Network. The 2006 Comic Relief Show was held under the title '50 Years of Laughs' celebrating 50 years of Television in Australia. It was hosted by Colin Lane, and featured presenters such as Amanda Keller, Mikey Robins, Ugly Dave Gray and Derryn Hinch interviewing Kylie Mole.</li>
<li><b>Germany</b>: The German TV station Pro 7 initiated a similar event in 2003.  By selling red noses, money is collected for the charity foundations PowerChild, <i>Deutsche Kinder- und Jugendstiftung</i> (lit., German Child and Youth Foundation), and Comic Relief.  The event is called 'Red Nose Day', and took place annually in March or April from 2003 to 2006.  However ratings and the collected donations fell way short of expectations in 2006, resulting in no main show being produced in 2007 and 2008. In 2003, Nena (who is famous for her hit song 99 Red Balloons) released an updated version of her song Wunder Gescheh'n (miracles happen) for the charity. In 2010, the Red Nose Day returned on Pro7. It took place on 25 November.</li>
<li><b>Russia</b>: A similar charity campaign, entitled "Red Nose, Kind Heart", was launched in Russia on 1 April 2007. The main goal of the drive, held between 1 April and 19 May 2007 by the Liniya Zhizni (Life Line) foundation, is raising money to help children afflicted with serious diseases (such as heart diseases).</li>
<li><b>Finland</b>: In 2002, the Finnish national broadcaster YLE started an annual charity event, which initially went under the title "Ylen hyvä". In 2007, the event adopted the name "Nenäpäivä" (Nose day), and the use of red noses to more closely follow the example of the British event.</li>
<li><b>Iceland</b>: <i>Dagur rauða nefsins</i> (Red Nose Day) has been held in support of UNICEF since 2006. It has featured the sale of red noses to raise funds and has enjoyed support and publicity from many local celebrities and televised events on the national broadcaster, RÚV.</li>
<li><b>Belgium</b>: "Rodeneuzendag" (Red Nose Day) has been held in Belgium for the first time in 2015 to raise money for children with psychiatric problems on VTM.</li></ul>
