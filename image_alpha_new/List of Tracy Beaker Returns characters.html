<p><b>Gina Conway</b>, played by Kay Purcell, is a careworker at <i>Elm Tree House</i> in <i>Tracy Beaker Returns</i> and the first series of <i>The Dumping Ground</i>. She first appeared on 8 January 2010, the start of <i>Tracy Beaker Returns</i>, and continued appearing until 15 March 2013, the final episode in series 1 of <i>The Dumping Ground</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Gina is of Jamaican descent with black and highlighted hair. She is kind and a great house mother to the children. Gina is very clever towards the children and the residents seem to respect her. She is able to control the children without them resenting her interventions, however the children sometimes see her as loud and brash when she is angry. But sometimes that is the only way to get them to listen too her.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Gina first encounters Tracy Beaker (Dani Harmer) when she opens the door to her after Tracy arrives at the Dumping Ground. Not really understanding who Tracy is, Gina tells Tracy that Mike Milligan (Connor Bryne) has gone out somewhere. Gina is sympathetic and lets Tracy in as it is pouring with rain outside. The kids at the Dumping Ground recognise Tracy from a television broadcast and Tracy gives a copy of her signed autobiography to Gina for 99p less. Gina allows Tracy to tuck all the kids into their beds. When Tracy finally talks to Mike, he accidentally lets slip to Gina that Tracy was arrested for using Cam Lawson (Lisa Coleman)'s credit card. Gina is angry because she let Tracy put the kids to bed. Gina does not warm to Tracy at first, but grows to adore her and usually stand up for her. Gina then encounters trouble with one of the older children, Sapphire Fox (Saffron Coomber) when she doesn't allow her to go with her dad on his tour, but that was for safety reasons. Gina is strict but cares very much about the kids.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Gina appears throughout "The Dumping Ground"'s first series, continuing her role as a care worker, however, at the beginning of series 2, new care worker, May-Li Wang reveals that Gina no longer works at the care home. Head writer (at the time) Elly Brerwer confirmed on Twitter that Gina had been given a bit of a promotion, in order to be able to afford to keep her mum Hattie in a care home. Gina's mum Hattie has Dementia, she made an appearance in the 8th episode of Series 1. Gina has been mentioned 3 times after her off screen departure, by May-Li in Jody in Wonderland, Mike in Hope (Series 2 episode 12) and Tyler in Snake (Series 7 Episode 8)

<p><b>Carmen Howle</b>, portrayed by Amy-Leigh Hickman, made her first appearance on 8 January 2010 in series 1 of Tracy Beaker Returns during the episode <i>Full Circle</i>. She departed in series 4 during the episode <i>One For Sorrow</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Carmen is an exceptionally outgoing girl who shares much of her life with Lily, becoming saddened when she leaves the Dumping Ground. Carmen is medium-height with long brown hair and brown eyes and often wears a lot of make-up. She seems eager, kind and caring, but impatient, although she has a tendency to appear light-headed, to be judgemental, and to spill secrets. Her favourite colour is pink, and she has turbulent relationships with many of the other residents of the Dumping Ground, such as Bailey, Elektra and Johnny. She also has a terrible relationship with her mother, who abandoned her when she was little, so that she could have a holiday.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In 'Family Values' Carmen is lonely when Lily gets fostered. No-one wants to hear her problems so she takes a precious item from each resident.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In 'Viva Carmen' Carmen's Mum, Helen, returns, saying she wants Carmen to live with her in Spain. However Helen then dumps Carmen for her ex Lee.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 'The Werewolf' Carmen thinks she saw a werewolf. The werewolf is actually Sapphire's brother Riff wearing a mask.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Carmen does not perform well at school, we know this because in the episode" A Day In The Past" Johnny insults her by saying "I've seen your school grades, you'll be lucky to be a cleaner when you're older".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Carmen's best friend is Lily but is also shown to be good friends with Tee. She also has on and off friendships with Jody and Elektra. Floss seems to look up to Carmen, as they like the same things, such as make-up. Carmen also went out with Rick in the episode 'Be My Girl' but the two broke up after finding their relationship too challenging.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In "Party Games" Carmen and Bailey battle it out for celebrity foster parents. Carmen wins, but turns down the opportunity when her potential foster mum is rude to the other children.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In "Stuck With You" Carmen and Jody, argue over a musical box, which Jody bought. They argue so much, that Floss handcuffs them together, but loses the key.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>In "Now You See Me" Carmen tries to discourage Tee from doing street art.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In "Fake It To Make It" Carmen applies to be the face of the future. She gets through to the second selection round, which involves doing science experiments. She messes up though, and does not get the part.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In "The Goodbye Girl" She gives Tyler some dating advice.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In "What Matters" and "Refuge" She helps Kazima struggle through her application to stay in the UK.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In "Slings And Arrows" she directs the Shakespeare play the kids are doing to save Ashdine Ridge.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In "Stepping Up" Carmen Jody and Tee work together in a street dance competition.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In "They Walk Among Us" She helps Tee on her date with Zach, a fitness coach.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In "Growing Pains" She goes with Tee to an interview for college. She gets lost whilst waiting for Tee, and finds herself in a drama class. She gets an offer to come to the college, but denies, and accepts for Tee on her behalf.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>In "First Past The Post" She tells the police that Mike lost her file. She does not tell the other kids though.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>In "Survivors" she stays behind to look after Harry with Ryan. Harry runs away to Mike's house. Carmen and Ryan find him there and take him back. She tells Ryan that she told the police, and is going to tell Harry, but Mike tells her not to.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In "The End Of It All, it comes out that she told the police. When Mike comes back, she is forgiven though.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>She makes a final appearance in "One For Sorrow" with Tee when they move out together.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p>

<p><b>Tee Taylor</b>, portrayed by Mia McKenna-Bruce, made her first appearance on 8 January 2010 in series 1 of Tracy Beaker Returns during the episode <i>Full Circle</i>. She departed in series 4 during the episode <i>One For Sorrow</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Tee is small and diminutive, yet understanding, kind and caring, although her brother's controlling and overprotective influence over her in the first series of "Tracy Beaker Returns" made her a quieter character. She has dark blonde, almost brown, hair and brown eyes. She also shows a caring personality towards younger children, like Mo, Floss, Harry and her younger sister Hope. Tee and Ryan Reeves often have issues with each other, and they always fall out and accuse each other of things, which often becomes quite serious in certain situations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>In <i>By The Book</i>, when Tracy is told to enforce the cleaning rota, Johnny believes it will get him and his sister, Tee fostered and starts volunteering himself and Tee for everyone's chores in return for gold stars in his file. He begins to force her to do chores when she doesn't want to. But Tracy's attempt to deal with the situation results in Tee almost getting injured, resulting in Johnny lashing out at her for not looking after Tee properly, and she begins to reconsider her future at the Dumping Ground, until Tee and Johnny apologise to her the next day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>In <i>What You Don't Know</i>, Tee, and Johnny return to the 'Dumping Ground' from their trial foster placement with Mr and Mrs Watson. Everyone who is involved in the placement faces an awkward situation: the Watsons are happy to foster Tee, but not Johnny. Eventually, Tee decides not to be fostered as she doesn’t want to leave her brother behind.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>In "Shadows", Tee finds a trail of riddles, each leading to a different clue, which eventually leads her to the time capsule which was buried at The Dumping Ground in <i>The Story of Tracy Beaker</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>In "Summer Holiday", she ruins a holiday by accidentally forgetting to close a gate and letting sheep get into the farm house where they are staying. When Lily and Carmen plan to go to Lily's dads campsite, Tee goes on the bus to stop them but the bus moves and they are stuck on the bus until Wales. When the man with tickets comes and collects them, he asks for Tee's ticket but she didn't have one and she asks to get off. Carmen goes with Tee leaving Lily on the bus by herself. 5 seconds later the bus stops again and it's Lily. They walk off through a wood. And Tee finds herself at a holiday place. Later they are on their new holiday, all thanks to Tee.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>In <i>Oh, Mo</i>, Tee was made to look after new, eccentric resident, Mo. She soon regretted her decision when Mo started clamouring for her company and saying they were best friends. This led to an accident in which Mo was injured. Mike decided that Mo shouldn't live in Elm Tree House after the incident, but the young people beg for Mo to stay, so he did.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>In "Hope" Tee gets a letter from her mum, who wants to meet up with her and Johnny. Johnny tells her not to, as he thinks it might be a trap, but Tee goes to see her mum at the women's refuge and meets her baby sister, Hope. It is revealed that Tee's mum has left her abusive boyfriend Keith. Tee later gets worried that her mum is not looking after Hope properly, and steals her, but she bumps into Faith, who notifies Johnny. He pretends to go along with Tee's plan to get the baby fostered but secretly texts their mum. She got Hope back, and Tee and Johnny see her regularly.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>In "Now You See Me", Tee makes friends with a street artist, and starts doing graffiti, which nearly results in her getting arrested.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>In "Breaking In", Tee and Kazima are at The Dumping Ground on their own, and end up battling against two burglars who break into the house.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>In "Dragon Slayer", Tee's older brother, Johnny, is about to leave to join the army, when both Tee and Johnny step-dad, Keith, turns up to see Hope. He soon becomes trouble, and then Johnny has to face down Keith to get him to go away for good. When Keith leaves, Johnny leaves to join the army.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>In "Who Are You" Tee and Ryan Nearly make up, before a boy from Ryan's old care home walks in and spills the beans, of what was actually meant to happen. Ryan pretended to make up with Tee, but all the information Tee gave him about what he thought about Ryan, and the order that the other kids came in, to upset the other children.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>In "What Matters" Tee naughtily goes out with Sasha to skate night, when she wasn't meant to, and used Billie and Toni to cover for her. This gets the twins grounded. Teee admits, she made them cover for her, but it is revealed that May-Li knew they had gone. She runs away to buy presents for the twins and Kazima, who was applying to stay in the UK.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>In "Hold The Front Page" Tee accuses Ryan of pushing Finn down the stairs, and she claims she saw him push him which later on she didn't because Finn faked his fall to get attention.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>In "Growing Pains" Tee went to an art college interview with Carmen. She struggles to find her feet, and messes up the interview. Carmen gets a place at the drama section, and they fall out. Tee burns all her art, but Carmen had accepted the place at the college. They then make up.

<p><b>Harry Jones</b>, portrayed by Philip Graham Scott, made his first appearance on 8 January 2010 in series 1 of Tracy Beaker Returns during the episode <i>Full Circle</i>. He departed in series 4 during the episode <i>One For Sorrow</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>During "Tracy Beaker Returns", Harry looks up to Sapphire Fox, as he is one of the younger residents, and she is a maternal figure – he finds it difficult to adjust when she leaves Elm Tree House to get her own flat, and later identifies Faith Davis as a maternal figure to him. When she leaves, this changes to Ryan Reeves. He is initially a diminutive but cheeky character; he enjoyed carrying round his treasured toy giraffe named Jeff, until Floss took him for herself when she arrived at the Dumping Ground. Harry is small, with a thicket of curly blond hair and blue eyes. He appears to be wearing wellies most of the time during the earlier series.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>During "The Dumping Ground", Harry finds new friends in Mo Michaels and Floss Guppy, later revealing his secret passion for wrestling. He does leave in the third series in the sixth episode, "It's Not about the Money", to Floss's dismay, after finding a foster placement, but then soon returns on the ninth episode, "Long Way Home", when something goes wrong with his foster family and with his fellow foster Brother Finn McLaine. In "The Goodbye Girl" he gives Floss his Jeff. She lets him borrow it in "Survivors"  and then gives it to Mike, who is suspended.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>In "Perfect Match" Sasha thinks that her adoptive parents, would suit Harry. He comes round to the idea, and Lou and Ange decide to look further into the possibility.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>Lily has a strong friendship with Carmen Howle (Amy-Leigh Hickman) during the first series onwards.

Lily and her sisters are fostered in <i>Family Values</i> - Carmen is deeply saddened. Lily returns to the 'Dumping Ground' in <i>Sisters</i>. Despite the protests of her foster parents Matt and Christie, Lily still wanted to have primary control over the care of her sisters. This is because she has been the 'mother figure' to her sisters for a very long time. Tracy's attempts to resolve the matter end in failure.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>However, in <i>Fallen</i>, Matt and Christie decide to take her back, against Lily's wishes.

Gus has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism, which makes him eager to keep tidy, and so he is a stickler for detail and he always carries notebooks and writes in them every day. Gus is tall for his age with black curly hair. He is always seen wearing a blue shirt and beige trousers, and enjoys playing the piano, but is socially awkward due to the Asperger's; he despises too much noise, and hates disorder, feeling that everything must be timetabled. During "The Dumping Ground"'s first series, he was fostered by a lesbian couple.

<p><b>Toby Coleman</b> is a resident of Elm Tree House throughout the first two series of "Tracy Beaker Returns", who made his first appearance in the first series of <i>Tracy Beaker Returns</i>. He is played by actor John Bell. He was put into care after his parents died in a car crash. Toby blamed himself for his parent's death, as he said he shouted at them and called them names before they walked out to go for a drive to cool down a bit. Toby was fostered at one point but his foster mother was killed when struck by lightning. Because of these events, Toby has always been convinced he's cursed. Throughout his stay at the Dumping Ground, he proves to be a loyal friend and is usually a source of calm at the residence. He is best friends with Johnny and gets along with the older residents like Liam, Frank and Elektra. Toby also seemed to have a crush on Elektra. But that was never developed been as the actor didn't come back to play his role as Toby for the third series. Toby is very into his comics and sci-fi things. As he has numerous comic collections and has many sci-fi related stuff in his bedroom. You can also see a Doctor Who poster in his bedroom that has the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) featured on it. This may have been a small Easter egg, as John Bell's first acting job was in Doctor Who in 2007, in the episode Utopia.

<p><b>Mandy "Elektra" Perkins</b> was a difficult and rebellious resident of Elm Tree House during the second and third series of "Tracy Beaker Returns" and the first series of "The Dumping Ground", and was portrayed by Jessica Revell. Elektra presents herself as a tough young lady who is happy to bully and intimidate people. She is quite mean, sarcastic, and cunning, and whilst she does have caring moments, and begins friendships with Toby, Carmen and Johnny, she mainly displays her tough, uncaring and mean side. She shows more of her softer side in The Dumping Ground and has friendships with Faith and Rick.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">82</span></p><p>Elektra arrives in <i>Elektra</i>, during the second series, instantly beginning her stay by fighting Liam, later explaining this as a reflex reaction following several tough experiences in other care homes. She begins to form a gang with the other residents, forcing them to commit thefts for her personal gain to test their loyalty to her.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">83</span></p><p>In "A Day in the Country", Elektra is left jilted after Carmen almost dies falling off a bridge due to her actions; she also saves Harry from an adder.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">84</span></p><p>During "Snake Bite", Elektra is reunited with her old gang, the Cobras, although after they try to rob Toby she realises that what they’re doing is wrong, and she moves on, leaving the gang behind.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">85</span></p><p><i>Going Home</i> reveals more about Elektra's character and family background. Elektra's sister, Melissa Perkins, arrives at Elm Tree House in order to ask Elektra to be her bridesmaid. The residents find it amusing that Elektra's real name is Mandy. Melissa breaks the news that she is going to get married to a man named Harvey. The two sisters shop for dresses and Elektra observes through Melissa's behaviour that her mother has a strong influence upon every aspect of the wedding. Elektra is emphatic that she not be forced to change her hair, no matter what her controlling mother dictates. Elektra's mother put Elektra in care despite the fact that Elektra did not want to go into care. Melissa convinces Elektra that both of her parents love her and that they would welcome her if she came to lunch. Tracy accompanies Elektra to lunch with her parents. Although they kicked Elektra out of the house, they have made an effort to see her since. Elektra appears to be pleased that her mother took the time to buy a vegetarian lasagne for her. Her mother seems to think that Elektra has severe behavioural problems and wants to focus upon the wedding whereas Elektra's father at first seems to be more concerned about his daughter's welfare and putting the past behind them. History seems to repeat itself when Elektra's mother assumes control by saying that bridesmaids cannot have blue hair. Elektra becomes infuriated when her mother tells her that she must keep the fact that she resides at a care home a secret from Harvey. Mrs Perkins told Harvey that her daughter was away at a boarding school. Elektra rings the wedding planner in order to cancel the wedding by pretending to be her mother. Melissa comes to the Dumping Ground and gives Elektra a gift, a new pair of white boots for the wedding. Melissa is furious when she discovers that Elektra cancelled the wedding. She states that Elektra does not deserve a family. She also showcases her feelings of resentment when she states that she always had to be the good daughter and that she was not able to attend her own prom because her parents were too busy dealing with Elektra's problems with the police.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">86</span></p><p>Many events during the series, like Elektra behaviour during Gus's adoption, have led viewers to the idea that she is a lesbian. And she also had a Pride flag in her bedroom and also owned a badge that had the pride flag pattern on it.

<p><b>Tyler Lewis</b>, portrayed by Miles Butler-Hughton, made his first appearance on 6 January 2012 in series 3 of Tracy Beaker Returns during the episode <i>Slow Burn: Part 1</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">90</span></p><p>Before Tyler was put into care, he used to live with his mum, Sally. But Sally had bipolar, a mental disorder that causes depression and mood swings. So she was unfit to take care of Tyler. Tyler first lived at Burnywood Children's Home, which is known for being a horrible place to live where many residents get their stuff stolen, or bedroom doors kicked in, or even beaten up. The head care worker wasn't the best either, Dennis Stockle. In 2011, when Elm Tree House was closed because of budget cuts from the council, three residents from Elm Tree moved into Burnywood (Sapphire Fox, Carmen Howle and Harry Jones). It is unknown what caused the following event to happen, if Tyler was dared or just chose to do it, but he stole all of Carmen's stuff. When Carmen asked for it back, Tyler punched her and gave her a black eye. This changed Carmen's over-friendly and pushover-like personality, making her less of a softy. While Tyler was at Burnywood, he was close friends with Rick Barber, who kind of looked out for Tyler.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">91</span></p><p><b>Tracy Beaker Returns: Series 3</b>
In <i>Slow Burn</i>, Carmen recognises him as the young joker whom she blames for nicking her stuff while she was at Burnywood, after he and three other children from Burnywood arrive at Elm Tree House following a fire. They reignite their turbulent relationship, Tyler proves himself to be a prankster, however he reveals his softer side when he breaks down in tears as he sees the burnt remains of the only birthday card his mother ever gave to him. Him and Carmen call it quits on their feuds and become friends.
In shadows, Tyler's prankster side showed a lot after a thunderstorm caused a power cut in the DG. Tracy suggested it was the perfect night to tell ghost stories. While Johnny was telling a ghost story, Tyler continuously kept butting in and ruining it been as he found it laughable and had heard it before. Tyler continued to tease Johnny for the rest of the night, especially after telling a story about an electrician which seemed to scare Johnny a little, but he reluctantly said it didn't. When everyone had gone to bed, doors kept opening and closing, and Carmen saw a man come into her bedroom, and she was convinced it was an escaped prisoner that was on the news earlier in the night before the electricity went off. Tracy told everyone to go back to bed and stay in bed, but everyone was later woken up again when Gus started screaming. Someone had been into his room and messed about all his stuff in his room, which he has organised in a special way (as Gus had Asperger Syndrome. There was a writing written in one of his notebooks saying "BEWARE THE ELECTRICIAN", everyone blamed Tyler as he had told the ghost story about the electrician, but it was later revealed Johnny was the one causing all the trouble, been as he was angry that Tyler had just arrived at the DG, and humiliated Johnny, and everyone seemed to love Tyler for it. But Johnny swore he wasn't the one in Carmen's bedroom. The next morning when an electrician came to fix the electric, Johnny and Tyler (who were in the kitchen) heard that a recently escaped prisoner had returned to the police station in the morning, claiming that he had spent the night in a big old house nearby, meaning it was the prisoner who was hiding in the house. Johnny and Tyler went to tell Tracy (who was in the garden with Carmen, Tee and Lily), but decided not to when they saw how unsettled Carmen seemed about it. Tyler then covered up for Johnny, saying it was him in Carmen's room last night. Johnny later asks why Tyler covered up for him after what he did, and Tyler said because it's what you do for your friends. They also end their feud, and become friends.
In Big Brother, when Liam and Elektra had an argument, Elektra took revenge by stealing his MP3 player and sold it to Tyler. Later Tyler was listening to the MP3 on the settee, but Liam walked past the living room and saw Tyler with his MP3 Player. Liam went and snatched it off him and pushed over the sofa Tyler was sitting on and also shouted at Tyler for nicking his stuff. Later that day some of the kids went to the cinema to see a film, but Tyler and Elektra stay behind. And decide to get their own back on Liam by moving his entire bedroom into the back garden.
In Eggs, when the kids want Mike to buy them a new computer, Mike doesn't agree to it as he feels he can't trust them with stuff as they have history of breaking things, like Carmen throwing a games remote out the window by accident, Johnny and Elektra using snooker cues as ninja sticks, and Tyler's second-hand bike nicked. Tracy suggest for them to set the kids a task of them looking after an egg for a day, to see if they can go a whole day looking after an egg without it breaking, as it is a delicate object. Tyler is paired with Gus, and annoys Gus as Tyler is the complete opposite to Gus. Tyler and Gus not getting on, causes Gus to break the egg by accident by slamming the piano shut. Everyone else break their eggs too, but Elektra and Johnny decide to buy new eggs from the shops and hope Tracy doesn't notice. But what they didn't know was that Tracy drew pencil marks on the eggs, so she'd know if they broke and replaced the eggs or not. So in the end, Mike doesn't get them a new computer. During that episode, Rick moved back into the Dumping Ground after being fostered, and it not working out due to Rick being agitated by his foster brother.
In Justine Littlewood Returns, Tyler sided with Justine shortly when she returned and made Tracy's life just as hard as she made it when they were kids living in the Dumping Ground.
In Reward, when Johnny was angry at Tracy when he overheard that she couldn't think of anything good besides good at cleaning at an annual awards for kids in care. Him and Elektra decided to distract Tracy, and edit the certificates to everyone by telling everyone what Mike, Gina and Tracy really think of the kids by reading everyone's files. Carmen is described as needy, weedy and greedy for attention. Tracy then comes in to find Johnny and Elektra reading out their versions of certificates, she tells them to stop but Johnny decides to read out Tyler's "award" for wetting the bed all the time. Johnny and Elektra find this amusing, but Tyler gets upset, pushes Johnny and storms off to his room. Tracy and Rick try to convince Tyler that it's not a big deal, and that everyone at some point in their life has wet the bed. When Tyler comes back downstairs, Gus starts asking everyone if they have wet the bed. When he asks Rick, Rick says it's Tyler's fault. Because when Tyler and Rick first moved into the Dumping Ground, Rick found out Tyler wets the bed. So Tyler decided to make Rick wet the bed one night by putting his hand in a bucket of cold water in the night, that can cause you to wet the bed and would threaten to tell everyone Rick wets the bed, if Rick said anything to anyone about Tyler wetting the bed. Rick then goes on to say that he wouldn't of said anything in the first place. Before everyone set off to go to the awards, Tee apologised to Tyler about Johnny's behaviour towards Tyler. Tyler told Tee and Harry about the dream he always has before he wets the bed; and that he's with his mum, saying that she wishes a big wave would come and wash all the bad stuff away. Tyler thinks that she meant that a big wave would come and wash him away too, and then there's a big wave coming towards him really fast. Then he wakes up and he's wet the bed. Later after the awards ceremony, Johnny apologises to Tyler himself and Tyler forgives him. Harry then comes and suggests to Tyler that in his dream before the big wave comes that makes him wet the bed, that he should build a boat so he doesn't get wet. When he goes to bed and has the dream, he dreams he built a boat so he doesn't get washed away and then he wakes up and finds that he hasn't wet the bed. Tyler then decides to get his own back on Johnny for making fun of him for wetting the bed, by putting a bucket of cold water by his (Johnny's) bed and putting his hand in the water so he would wet the bed. The episode ended there so we didn't get to see Johnny's reaction to Tyler's prank.
In Summer Holiday, Tyler joined everyone else ignoring and teasing Tee about losing their holiday, by leaving a gate open on the farm they were staying at causing sheep to escape and trash the house they were staying in. Getting them banned from the farmer's farm and losing their holiday. When everyone had to return to the Dumping Ground, in boredom Tyler and Harry decided to squirt water at Rick with water guns, Rick chases them and picks up a bag of flour to throw at them. But Gina comes in to see what all the noise is about, and unluckily gets hit by the flour bag thrown by Rick. Tyler and Rick are punished, by being made to clean up the mess they made in the kitchen, while Harry manages to sneak off away from the scene. Later, Tyler and everyone else forgive Tee and apologise for being mean to her when Tee manages to find a new holiday for everyone.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">92</span></p><p>In series two of "The Dumping Ground", Tyler's mum decides to visit but Tyler then discovers she is not taking her medication for her bipolar disorder, so he gets angry, but eventually they reconcile.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">93</span></p><p>Tyler was put in care because his mother was ill so she couldn't look after him properly. Tyler doesn't know his dad but in one episode-"BABY"- Tyler scams Johnny into thinking his dad is a billionaire.

<p><b>Rick Barber</b> (played by Daniel Pearson) is a resident of Elm Tree House, and later Ashdene Ridge, during the third series of "Tracy Beaker Returns" and the first two series of "The Dumping Ground"; he went into care when his parents went to prison for fraud. Rick is tall with brown hair and blue eyes. He is nice and intelligent but also hot-headed and moody. He is a very fair character, and has good morals. He finds a friend in Carmen, is naturally protective of Tyler, he plays the guitar and enjoys listening to his parents' old vinyl records, feeling that they are all that is left of the memories he had with them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">95</span></p><p>Rick expresses a wish for a sibling, but says his parents never had more children as it was impractical in case they needed to pack up and leave suddenly, due to being scammers. When Rick and Carmen become closer, Carmen learns more about Rick's character. He tells Carmen that both of his parents used to con people out of money. Things were good for a while until his parents got sent to prison and Rick ended up in the care home. Rick feels guilty because his parents used to involve him in their scams and this meant that his parents were able to purchase nice things for him. He regrets benefitting from exploiting people.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">96</span></p><p>In <i>Dreamland</i> ("The Dumping Ground" series 1, episode 8), Rick gets a huge shock when he finds his dad, disguised as a boiler man, inside the Dumping Ground. Gerry is on leave from prison for a short amount of time and insists that he's above board now and promises Rick a happy family future, but it quickly becomes clear that Gerry still loves the buzz of a hustle, and Rick is distraught.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">97</span></p><p>Rick leaves Ashdene Ridge/The Dumping Ground in between the second and third series of "The Dumping Ground". Elly Brewer confirmed on Twitter that he moved out of the Dumping Ground to be with his mum once she got out of prison.

<p><b>Jody Jackson</b>, portrayed by Kia Pegg, made her first appearance on 9 March 2012 in series 3 of Tracy Beaker Returns during the episode <i>Jody Jackson</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">99</span></p><p>During her first appearance, she is portrayed as being like a tramp, having lived in squalor; she is dressed in simple clothes and smells terrible – this means Carmen develops a low opinion of her, before she discovers she is sharing with her. Carmen immediately resents and is unsympathetic to Jody and feels that her presence is intrusive.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">100</span></p><p>When she reveals she is afraid to take a bath, Tracy entices her with bath jelly, which Jody seems to like. Jody tells Tracy that her mother used to scrub her with a scrubbing brush, only when the Social Worker attended. She also reveals that when she was naughty, people used to hold her under the water. Jody borrows a cardigan from Carmen. Elektra responds by locking Jody in the toy cupboard. Jody manages to escape by knocking out one of the wood panels from the door. Jody then disappears and Tracy thinks that Jody might have gone to her old home, where Jody used to live with her mother and Jody's brothers. Mike and Tracy arrive to find the place vacant, with the exception of Jody. Carmen shows compassion towards Jody later on in the episode. Later in the night, Carmen, Gus and Gina discover Jody sleeping under the kitchen table. Jody says that she was scared to sleep in a room with another person. A very sympathetic Gina offers to make up a bed for Jody in the quiet room. The episode concludes with Elektra and Sapphire sharing a room so that Jody is able to have a room of her own.
