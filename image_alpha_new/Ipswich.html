The town has been continuously occupied since the Saxon period, and its port has been one of England's most important for the whole of its history. The modern name is derived from the medieval name <i>Gippeswic</i>, probably taken either from an Old Saxon personal name or from an earlier name of the Orwell estuary (although unrelated to the name of the River Gipping). It has also been known as <i>Gyppewicus</i> and <i>Yppswyche</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Ipswich is a non-metropolitan district and is a large settlement despite itâ€™s town status. The urban development of Ipswich overspills the borough boundaries significantly, with 75% of the town's population living within the borough at the time of the 2011 Census, when it was the fourth-largest urban area in the United Kingdom's East of England region, and the 42nd-largest urban area in England and Wales. In 2011, the town of Ipswich was found to have a population of 133,384, while the Ipswich built-up area is estimated to have a population of approximately 180,000 in 2011.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The town is split into various quarters, with central and the waterfront drawing the most footfall. Central is home to the town's retail shopping and the square, the Cornhill. The waterfront is a popular area of the town which is home to hotels, restaurants and pubs. The waterfront was once an industrial port and served as the most important dock in the kingdom, the area has since been transformed into a trendy and picturesque setting housing the town's marina and various high-rise apartment buildings. The waterfront is also home to the UK's newest university, the University of Suffolk. The quarter between central and the waterfront is known as the saints, the saints is characterised by the many Tudor houses which hosts a variety of independent shops and cafes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Ipswich has become a tourist hotspot in the UK with 3.5 million people reported to have visited the county town in 2016. Ipswich was voted as the 7 most desirable places to live and work in England by the Royal Mail 2017. In 2018, Ipswich was voted as one of the best up and coming places to live in the UK by the London Economic, and in 2015, Ipswich was rated as third happiest place to live in the UK.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Roman_settlement">Roman settlement</span></h3>
<p>Ipswich is one of England's oldest towns, if not the oldest. At its core Ipswich was and is the oldest still continuing town to have been established and developed by the English. It has an unbroken history of community as a town since early Anglo-Saxon times. Under the Roman empire, the area around Ipswich formed an important route inland to rural towns and settlements via the rivers Orwell and Gipping. A large Roman fort, part of the coastal defences of Britain, stood at Walton near Felixstowe (13 miles, 21Â km), and the largest Roman villa in Suffolk (possibly an administrative complex) stood at Castle Hill (north-west Ipswich).

<p>The modern town took shape in Anglo-Saxon times (7thâ€“8th centuries) around the Ipswich docks. As the coastal states of north-western Europe emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire, essential North Sea trade and communication between eastern Britain and the continent (especially to Scandinavia, and through the Rhine) passed through the former Roman ports of London (serving the kingdoms of Mercia, the East Saxons, Kent) and York (Eoforwic) (serving the Kingdom of Northumbria).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p><i>Gipeswic</i> (also in other spellings such as <i>Gippeswich</i>) arose as the equivalent to these, serving the Kingdom of East Anglia, its early imported wares dating to the time of King RÃ¦dwald, supreme ruler of the English (616â€“624). The famous ship-burial and treasure at Sutton Hoo nearby (9 miles, 14.5Â km) is probably his grave. The Ipswich Museum houses replicas of the Roman Mildenhall and Sutton Hoo treasures. A gallery devoted to the town's origins includes Anglo-Saxon weapons, jewellery and other artefacts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<div style="float:left; clear:left; margin-right:1em;"></div>
<p>The seventh-century town was centred near the quay. Towards 700 AD, Frisian potters from the Netherlands area settled in Ipswich and set up the first large-scale potteries in England since Roman times. Their wares were traded far across England, and the industry was unique to Ipswich for 200 years. With growing prosperity, in about 720 AD a large new part of the town was laid out in the Buttermarket area. Ipswich was becoming a place of national and international importance. Parts of the ancient road plan still survive in its modern streets.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>After the invasion of 869 Ipswich fell under Viking rule. The earth ramparts circling the town centre were probably raised by Vikings in Ipswich around 900 to prevent its recapture by the English. They were unsuccessful. The town operated a mint under royal licence from King Edgar in the 970s, which continued through the Norman Conquest until the time of King John, in about 1215. The abbreviation <i>Gipes</i> appears on the coins.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>King John granted the town its first charter in 1200, laying the medieval foundations of its modern civil government.  Thenceforth Ipswich strongly maintained its jurisdiction over the so-called Liberty, a region extending over about 35 square kilometres centred on the town.

One of Henry VIII's closest political allies, he founded a college in the town in 1528, which was for its brief duration one of the homes of the Ipswich School. He remains one of the town's most famed figures.

<p>Ipswich is governed locally by a two-tier council system. Ipswich Borough Council fulfils district council functions such as refuse collection, housing and planning and Suffolk County Council provides the county council services such as transport, education and social services.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>The town is covered by two parliamentary constituencies: Ipswich, which covers about 75% and, as of JuneÂ 2017, is represented by Labour MP Sandy Martin, and Central Suffolk &amp; North Ipswich, which covers the remaining 25% and is represented by Conservative MP Dan Poulter.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>In April 2006 the borough council initiated public discussions about the idea of turning the borough into a unitary authority; Ipswich had constituted a county borough from 1889 to 1974, independent of the administrative county of East Suffolk, and this status was not restored by the Banham/Cooksey Commission in the 1990s. Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter and Oxford united to campaign for unitary authority status for the four towns, hoping to use the window of opportunity presented by the October 2006 Local Government White Paper. In March 2007, it was announced that Ipswich was one of 16 shortlisted councils and on 25 July 2007, the secretary of state announced that she was minded to implement the unitary proposal for Ipswich, but that there were 'a number of risks relating to the financial case set out in the proposal', on which she invited Ipswich to undertake further work before a final decision was taken. Early in December plans were thrown into doubt as the government announced that it had 'delayed' the unitary bids for Ipswich and Exeter. In July 2008 the Boundary Committee announced its preferred option was for a unitary authority covering Ipswich and the south eastern corner of Suffolk, including Felixstowe.

<p>Being the county town of agricultural Suffolk, industry around Ipswich has had a strong farming bias with Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies Ltd, one of the most famous agricultural manufacturers, located in the town. It is notable that the world's first commercial motorised lawnmower was built by Ransomes in 1902. Ransomes &amp; Rapier was a major British manufacturer of railway equipment and later cranes, from 1869 to 1987. There was a sugar beet factory at Ipswich for many years; it was closed in 2001 as part of a rationalisation by British Sugar. This agricultural link is preserved in the local football club's nickname "The Tractor Boys". Phillips &amp; Piper Ltd on Old Foundry Road employed many women who sewed equestrian and hunt jackets for Harrods, Pytchley, and other labels for 130 years, finally closing down in June 1982.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>A key employment sector is insurance, both wholesale and retail sectors. Some of the major players with a key presence in Ipswich include Axa, Churchill, Legal &amp; General, LV and Willis. Access to a skilled and experienced workforce has also led to the establishment of ancillary businesses serving these companies, including call centres dealing with sales and claims.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>Ipswich is one of the Haven ports and is still a working port, handling several million tonnes of cargo each year. Prior to decommissioning, HMS <i>Grafton</i> was a regular visitor to the port and has special links with the town and the county of Suffolk. HMS <i>Orwell</i>, named after the river, is also closely linked with Ipswich.

<p>Ipswich is located close to the A14 and the A12 roads; it is also on the Great Eastern main line from London to Norwich, the East Suffolk line to Lowestoft and the Felixstowe branch line.  There are two railway stations, Ipswich and Derby Road. It is an hour from Stansted airport, 40 minutes from Harwich international port and is also on Sustrans's National Cycle Route 1 and National Cycle Route 51. The port of Felixstowe is a major container port 12 miles (19Â km) to the east.

<p>Ipswich's sole professional association football club is Ipswich Town, which was established in 1878 and, as of 2018, plays in the second-tier Football League Championship at the 30,300-capacity Portman Road stadium. Elected to the Football League in 1938, they have a strong rivalry with Norwich City, and were the previous club of the two most successful England managers, Alf Ramsey, who was buried in the Old Cemetery in the town on his death in 1999, and Bobby Robson. Ipswich won the League Championship in 1961â€“62 in their first season as a top division club during Ramsey's reign, as well as the 1978 FA Cup and the 1981 UEFA Cup under Robson. The club are also undefeated at home in all European competitions having drawn six and won the other 25.

<p>Suffolk New College is a further education college located in Ipswich, serving students from the town and wider area. There is also a sixth form college, 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>One, which serves students from the same area.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>Ipswich is the location of the University of Suffolk, Suffolk's first Higher Education Institution (HEI), established in 2007. It was originally a collaborative venture involving the University of Essex in Colchester, the University of East Anglia in Norwich, various further-education colleges and Suffolk County Council. However, the university was granted its own Degree Awarding Powers in November 2015, and in May 2016 it was awarded university status. The university was renamed to the University of Suffolk in August 2016, prior to its former name University Campus Suffolk.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h2>
<p>Ipswich experiences an oceanic climate, like the rest of the British Isles, with a narrow range of temperature and rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. One of the two nearest for which data is available is East Bergholt, about 7 miles (11Â km) south west of the town centre and at a similar elevation, and similar river valley/estuary situation. The average July maximum of 23.2Â Â°C (73.8Â Â°F) is the third-highest for a major settlement in the country, behind London and Colchester, illustrating the relative warmth of the area during the summer part of the year. The record maximum is 35.2Â Â°C (95.4Â Â°F), set during August 2003. Typically, 24.9 days of the year will record a maximum temperature of 25.1Â Â°C (77.2Â Â°F) or above, and the warmest day of the year should reach 30.0Â Â°C (86.0Â Â°F), on average.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">69</span></p>
<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="427" data-file-width="640" decoding="async" height="147" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Boat_at_Pin_Mill_-_geograph.org.uk_-_720588.jpg/220px-Boat_at_Pin_Mill_-_geograph.org.uk_-_720588.jpg" srcset width="220"/> <a name="image18"><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div><div style='border: 3px solid red'><center><h1 style='color:red'>18</h1></center></a></div>Clear skies over Pin Mill on the River Orwell</div></div></div>
<p>The absolute minimum is âˆ’16.1Â Â°C (3.0Â Â°F), set in January 1963, although frosts have been recorded in all months except July, August and September. In an average year, 55.33 nights will report an air frost. The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was âˆ’14.5Â Â°C (5.9Â Â°F) during December 2010.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">70</span></p><p>As with much of East Anglia, rainfall is low, averaging 569.3mm in a typical year, with 103.8 days of the year reporting over 1mm of rain. All averages refer to the period 1971â€“2000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">71</span></p><p>The weather station at Levington is even closer than East Bergholt at 9.4 kilometres (5.8Â mi) from the town centre further down the river estuary on the way to Felixstowe. It has a slightly more marine climate than East Bergholt, with slightly lower highs and milder lows throughout the year in the 1981â€“2010 average period. It is slightly less prone to frosts, averaging 35.5 such occurrences in a calendar year. Sunshine levels at 1,707.7 hours per annum are relatively high for the British Isles, but not abnormal for southern parts of England.

<p>Probably the most famous person born in the town is the Tudor Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. The artist Thomas Gainsborough and the cartoonist "Giles" worked here, Horatio, Lord Nelson, became Steward of Ipswich, and Margaret Catchpole began her adventurous career here. Alf Ramsey and Bobby Robson were both successful managers of Ipswich Town. Ipswich was the birthplace in 1741 of Sarah Trimmer, nÃ©e Kirby, writer and critic of children's literature and among the first to introduce pictorial material and animals and the natural world into it. Actor and director Richard Ayoade, best known for his role as Maurice Moss in <i>The IT Crowd</i>, was brought up in Ipswich, as was the ceramic artist Blanche Georgiana Vulliamy. Hugh Catchpole (OBE, CBE, Hilal-i-Imtiaz), a noted educationist which over 60 years of association with military schools and colleges in India and Pakistan, was born in Ipswich.
