<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Moore was born on April 10, 1984, in Nashua, New Hampshire, to Stacy (nėe Friedman), a former news reporter who once worked for the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i>, and Donald Moore, a pilot for American Airlines. Moore was raised Catholic, but has since developed a "hodgepodge of things" that she believes. Moore is of Russian Jewish (from her maternal grandfather), English and Irish descent. She is the middle of three children with an older brother, Scott and a younger brother, Kyle. When Moore was two months old, she and her family moved to Longwood, Seminole County, Florida, outside of Orlando, because of her father's job. She attended Bishop Moore Catholic High School in Orlando, Florida from 1998 to 1999.

<p>Moore became interested in singing and acting at a young age, and called her British maternal grandmother, Eileen Friedman, a professional ballerina in London, one of her inspirations. Moore said "My parents thought It was just a phase I'd grow out of. But I stuck to it and begged them for acting lessons, for voice lessons."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Moore began starring in a number of local productions, and performing the National Anthem at a number of events in Orlando. She was only twelve years old when she attended the Stagedoor Manor theater camp, where other celebrities including actress Natalie Portman had once attended. Production director Konnie Kittrell said about Moore "She was a quiet, sweet girl", and said that she earned a number of solos, but "She wasn't a spotlight seeker."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>When Moore was thirteen, she began working on music by herself. One day, while working in an Orlando studio, she was overheard by Victor Cade, a FedEx delivery man who had a friend in A&amp;R at Epic Records. Cade later sent this friend a copy of Moore's unfinished demo, and Moore signed on with the label.

<p>After signing with Epic Records, Moore began working on her debut album. While recording the album, Moore had to leave Bishop Moore Catholic High School when she was only in the ninth-grade, but continued receiving her education from tutors. In the summer of 1999, Moore began touring with the boy band NSYNC. Later that year, Moore also toured with the boy band Backstreet Boys.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Moore's debut single, "Candy", was released on August 17, 1999, in the U.S. The single was a commercial success in a number of countries, but was compared immediately to the teen pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. It debuted at number 88 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, before peaking at number 41 on the chart. The single later received a Gold certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding 500,000 copies in the U.S. The single was the most successful in Australia, where it peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and received a Platinum certification.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Moore's debut studio album, <i>So Real</i>, was released on December 7, 1999, by 550 Music through Epic Records. The album received a limited release in only a few countries. It received generally mixed reviews from critics when it was released, and Moore continued to be compared to other teen pop singers. Allmusic said about the album, "Fifteen-year-old Mandy Moore's debut album sounded like it was inspired almost entirely by listening to recent hit albums by 'N Sync, the Backstreet Boys, and Britney Spears." <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> had a similar opinion about the album, and gave it a C- in their review.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The album debuted at number 77 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. The album eventually continued to climb the chart until it peaked at number 31. It later received a Platinum certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding one million copies in the U.S. alone. The album's second single, "Walk Me Home", was released on the same day as the album. The single did not have the same success of its predecessor, failing to appear on any major charts, but it peaked at number 38 on the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Songs chart in the U.S. The third and final title single, "So Real", was released exclusively in certain territories on June 13, 2000. The single was not released in the U.S., but was released in territories such as Japan. In Australia, the single became her second Top 40 hit, peaking at number 21 on the ARIA Charts. The single also peaked at number 18 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Before promotion for <i>So Real</i> had even ended, Moore had already begun working on her second album. The album's title single, "I Wanna Be with You", was released on July 11, 2000. The song became her first single to chart on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 since her debut single, "Candy". "I Wanna Be with You" spent 16 weeks on the chart and reached its peak of 24 during its ninth week on the chart. The song became her first Top 20 hit on the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Songs chart, where it peaked at number 11. The single also became Moore's second Top 20 hit in Australia, where it peaked at number 13. It was also a minor success on the German Media Control Charts, where it peaked at number 70. The single received generally mixed reviews. <i>Billboard</i> praised the song and said, "Top 40 programmers and listeners alike will love Moore more with this track", but Allmusic chose the song as a highlight track from the album.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Moore's second studio album, <i>I Wanna Be with You</i>, was released on May 9, 2000. The album had the lead title single and songs from Moore's debut album <i>So Real</i>. <i>I Wanna Be with You</i> was released as Moore's debut album in a number of countries. The album received generally mixed reviews and was criticized because it was a remix album and not a true follow-up. Allmusic called the album  "trashier, flashier, gaudier, and altogether more disposable" than its predecessor <i>So Real</i>. The album was a commercial success, debuting and peaking at number 21 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. It later received a Gold certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone. Moore won the Kids' Choice Awards for <i>Favorite Rising Star</i> for the album in 2000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In 2001, Moore began working on her third studio album, which was said to move away from the "bubblegum pop" sound and image she became known for. Moore said during an interview with <i>Billboard</i> magazine that "All of the music has started to look and sound the same" and that she chose to move in a different musical direction. Moore also said that she wanted "no more dancers, no more singing to tracks. I got tired of that in a big way".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The album's lead single, "In My Pocket", was released on May 29, 2001. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> said the single had "pumping, Indian-influenced Eurodisco". It failed to chart on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in the U.S., but peaked at number 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, and it reached number 21 on the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Songs chart. The song became her third Top 20 hit in Australia, where it peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Charts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Moore's self-titled third studio album, <i>Mandy Moore</i>, was released on June 19, 2001. The album had uptempo dance and pop songs and influences from Middle Eastern music. The album received mixed to average reviews from critics. Allmusic called the album a "lush, layered production".  The album debuted and peaked at number 35 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, and later received a Gold certification from the RIAA. The album has sold an estimated 1.5 million copies worldwide. The album also reached number 37 on the ARIA charts in Australia, her highest peak in the country to date. The album's second single, "Crush", was released on August 28, 2001; it peaked at number 35 on the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Songs chart, and it climbed to number 25 on the ARIA Charts.

<p>Moore made her feature film debut in 2001, where she voiced a Girl Bear Cub in the comedy <i>Dr. Dolittle 2,</i> which starred Eddie Murphy. Later that year, Moore co-starred with Anne Hathaway in the comedy <i>The Princess Diaries,</i> based on Meg Cabot's novel of the same name, and was released on August 3, 2001. She played Lana Thomas, the rival of Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway). On her role, Moore told <i>In Style</i> Magazine, "I'm the crude popular girl who gets ice cream in her face."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The film opened in 2,537 theaters in North America and grossed $22,862,269 in its opening weekend. It grossed $165,335,153 worldwide—$108,248,956 in North America and $57,086,197 in other territories. The film received mixed to positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 47% of 113 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews and that it got a rating average of 5.2 out of 10. In the film, Moore performed a cover of Connie Francis's 1958 song "Stupid Cupid" while at a beach party.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In 2002, Moore made her starring debut with Shane West and Peter Coyote in the romantic drama <i>A Walk to Remember,</i> based on Nicholas Sparks's novel of the same name. She played Jamie Sullivan, the unpopular daughter of Reverend Sullivan (Coyote). The film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office raking in $12,177,488 in its opening weekend, behind <i>Snow Dogs</i> and <i>Black Hawk Down.</i> The film received generally negative reviews, but Roger Ebert of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> praised Moore and West's "quietly convincing" performances. It was a modest box office hit, earning $41,281,092 in the U.S. alone, and was a sleeper hit in Asia. The total revenue generated worldwide was $47,494,916. Moore received a number of nominations and awards for her performance in the film.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Moore's self-titled album's third and final single, "Cry," was released on November 4, 2001, to help promote the film. Commenting on the film, she said: "It was my first movie and I know people say it may be cliche and it's a tearjerker or it's cheesy, but for me, it's the thing I'm most proud of."

<h3><span id="2003.E2.80.932006:_Coverage_and_continued_acting"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="2003–2006:_Coverage_and_continued_acting">2003–2006: <i>Coverage</i> and continued acting</span></h3>
<p>In 2003, Moore began working on her fourth studio album, later revealed to be a cover album called <i>Coverage</i>. The album had covers of 1970s and 1980s songs. Moore's cover of John Hiatt's 1987 song "Have a Little Faith in Me" was released as the album's lead single shortly before the album, but it failed to enter any charts. The album was released on October 21, 2003, and received generally mixed reviews. Allmusic called the album a "leap to musical maturity," but <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> called it an "effort to shed her bubblegum-blond image."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>The album debuted at number 14 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, with first week sales of 53,000. This made it Moore's highest debut on the chart, and highest-peaking album to date, but it is her lowest-selling, and her first album not to be certified by the RIAA. Moore's cover of XTC's 1982 song "Senses Working Overtime" was released as the album's second single and also failed to have any chart success.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Moore's cover of Carole King's 1971 song "I Feel the Earth Move" was also on the compilation album <i>Love Rocks</i> from LGBT rights supporters. In 2004, Moore left Epic after five years of service because of creative differences. Moore and the label released her greatest hits album, <i>The Best of Mandy Moore</i> that had no new songs, on November 16, 2004, to end her contract. The album reached number 148 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Moore's second compilation album, <i>Candy,</i> was released on April 5, 2005.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>In 2003, Moore co-starred with Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher and Trent Ford in the romantic comedy-drama <i>How to Deal</i>, based on Sarah Dessen's novels <i>That Summer</i> and <i>Someone like You.</i> She played Halley Martin, a cynical and rebellious seventeen-year-old who deals with falling in love and her relationships and issues with her family and friends. The film failed to find teenage audiences in the U.S. and grossed a total of $14 million domestically.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In 2004, Moore co-starred with Matthew Goode in the romantic comedy <i>Chasing Liberty</i>. She played Anna Foster, the rebellious eighteen-year-old "First Daughter" who wants more freedom from the Secret Service. The film grossed approximately $12 million. Both <i>How to Deal</i> and <i>Chasing Liberty</i> received generally negative and lukewarm reviews, respectively; but Ebert singled Moore's performances out again and said in his review of <i>How to Deal</i> that Moore has "an unaffected natural charm" and "almost makes the movie worth seeing," and said in his review of <i>Chasing Liberty</i> that she has "undeniable screen presence and inspires instant affection." Other critics called Moore an "actress of limited range," but one review of <i>Chasing Liberty</i> called her the "most painless of former pop princesses." (Another romantic comedy with a similar theme, <i>First Daughter</i>, which starred Katie Holmes, was released later that year.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Late in 2004, Moore co-starred with Jena Malone, Macaulay Culkin and Patrick Fugit in the religion satirical comedy-drama <i>Saved!</i>. She played Hilary Faye Stockard, a proper and popular girl at a Christian high school. The film received generally positive reviews, but it did not receive a wide release. Moore's performance was praised, with one critic calling her a "demented delight" and another calling it her best performance to date. Her and Michael Stipe's cover of The Beach Boys's 1966 song "God Only Knows" bookended the film.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>In 2005, Moore co-starred in the sports family comedy-drama <i>Racing Stripes,</i> where she voiced Sandy the white horse, and guest-starred in the HBO comedy-drama <i>Entourage.</i> Moore was also originally scheduled to star in the films <i>Cursed,</i> <i>Havoc,</i> and <i>The Upside of Anger,</i> which were all eventually released in 2005, but without her involvement in any of them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>In 2006, Moore guest-starred as Julie Quinn in two episodes of the fifth season of the NBC medical sitcom <i>Scrubs</i>, that were the ninth episode "My Half-Acre" and the tenth episode "Her Story II". The same year, she guest-starred in the Fox animated sitcom <i>The Simpsons,</i> where she voiced Tabitha Vixx in the seventeenth-season finale called "Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Moore also co-starred with Hugh Grant, Dennis Quaid and William Dafoe in Paul Weitz's satirical comedy <i>American Dreamz</i>, which was released in April 2006. She played Sally Kendoo, a deranged contestant on a singing competition series modelled after <i>American Idol.</i> Weitz said that he had Moore in mind for the role before she was cast, explaining that "there's something inherently sweet about Mandy; it makes it all the more interesting to see her in a villainess role." Moore has said that she enjoys playing mean-spirited characters, but fears being typecast as a villain.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>The film opened at number nine at the U.S. box office, eventually totaling barely $7 million, and it received generally mixed reviews. Owen Gleiberman of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> praised Moore's and Grant's "wicked barbed chemistry" in their roles, but Robert Koehler of <i>Variety</i> called Moore's role a "pitch-perfect study of a woman for whom a reality show is reality."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>Later in 2006, Moore voiced Nita, the heroine of the Disney animated sequel <i>Brother Bear 2,</i> which was released directly to DVD on August 29, 2006. ComingSoon.net praised Moore's "surprisingly good performance." That same year, Moore was originally cast in Emilio Estevez's drama <i>Bobby,</i> but was replaced by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

<p>In 2006, Moore talked about her early albums, saying she believed her debut album <i>So Real</i> was appropriate for her age at the time when she released it, but she felt it "sucked" and that her first two albums were "just awful". Moore also said that she "would give a refund to everyone who bought [her] first two albums" if she could. During a radio interview in April 2006, the show's co-host—who had seen Moore's comments—asked her for a refund on her debut album, which she fulfilled.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>In early 2006, Moore said that she missed her music career and that singing is what she was the "most passionate about". Moore signed with Sire Records after her contract with Epic ended, but she left the label in May 2006 because of creative differences. She signed with The Firm, owned by EMI Music, in July that year, calling her recording contract "especially exciting", and saying that she left Sire because she did not want to "follow the mainstream", but rather have "complete control and freedom" over her music. Moore's fifth studio album <i>Wild Hope</i> was released on June 19, 2007, and Moore collaborated with a number of musicians on it, including Chantal Kreviazuk, Lori McKenna, Rachael Yamagata and The Weepies. Moore stayed alone in a house in Woodstock in Upstate New York while recording the album in late 2006. Moore performed the album's lead single "Extraordinary" at the Brick Awards on April 12, 2007, and launched a tour in the summer of 2007. The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics. <i>Billboard</i> said that "<i>Wild Hope</i> is the gratifying sound of a singer finally finding her comfort zone. Gone is the sugary pop of Moore's early career, replaced instead by thoughtful musings on love and life…an album full of subtle, but undeniable hooks." The album debuted on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200 at #30, selling a mere 25,000 copies the first week of its release, according to <i>Billboard</i>. It is Moore's third-highest-debuting album, falling short of her fourth studio album <i>Coverage</i> (2003), which debuted at #14 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, selling 59,000 copies. The album also reached #9 on The Top Internet albums. After five weeks, the album charted off the <i>Billboard</i> 200, but it returned to the chart at #118 after selling 5,500 copies. To date, the album has sold over 120,000 copies in the U.S. and more than 350,000 copies worldwide. On February 23, 2008, Moore released the album in Australia, and subsequently toured with musician Ben Lee and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra in Western Australia, supporting inaugural <i>American Idol</i> winner Kelly Clarkson on her tour. In October 2008, Moore posted on her website blog live videos of three songs that she had been working on, along with singer-songwriter, pianist and guitarist Mike Viola. It was initially expected to be a duo album between Moore and Viola, but then in January 2009, it was revealed it would be Moore's sixth studio album with a collaboration with Viola, that was scheduled to be released in April 2009.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Moore, citing her conservative upbringing, expressed dissatisfaction with her appearance on a May 2006 cover of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> where the headline was "orgasms unlimited", which referred to an article unrelated to her. Afterward, Moore co-starred with Diane Keaton, Gabriel Macht and Tom Everett Scott in the romantic comedy <i>Because I Said So</i>. In the film, Milly Wilder (Moore) describes in detail the feeling of an orgasm to her mother Daphne (Keaton). The film was released on February 2, 2007, and received mixed to negative reviews, but was a financial success, earning over $69 million worldwide at the box office. Later that year, Moore co-starred with John Krasinski and Robin Williams in the romantic comedy <i>License to Wed</i> which was released on July 3, 2007. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 7% rating and a critical consensus of "broad and formulaic". Metacritic.com rated it 25 out of 100, citing 21 generally negative reviews out of 30 for its rating. <i>Variety</i> called the film "an astonishingly flat romantic comedy, filled with perplexing choices", but <i>Variety</i> called Moore's performance "appealing". The film grossed $10,422,258 in its opening weekend opening at #4 at the U.S. Box Office behind <i>Live Free or Die Hard</i>, <i>Ratatouille</i> and <i>Transformers</i>, which opened at the top spot. The film had grossed $43.8 million domestically and $69.3 million worldwide. On September 24, 2007, Moore guest-starred in the CBS sitcom <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> in the third-season premiere called "Wait for It". Later that year, she co-starred with Billy Crudup, Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest in the romantic comedy <i>Dedication</i>. She played Lucy Reilly, a struggling children's book illustrator who falls in love with Henry Roth (Crudup). The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received 41% positive reviews, based on 46 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 50 out of 100, based on 19 reviews.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>Moore began working on her sixth studio album in 2008 that was scheduled to be released the following year. Recording sessions for the album took place around December 2008 in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's lead single "I Could Break Your Heart Any Day of the Week" was released on March 17, 2009, as a digital download. The music video premiered on April 20, 2009, on Yahoo! Music. The single, like most of Moore's previous singles, failed to have much success on any charts. Moore's sixth studio album, <i>Amanda Leigh</i>, was released on May 26, 2009. On the album, Moore said, "The music is all a reflection of me now, not somebody else's choices." Moore visited a number of talk shows including <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i> and <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>. On both shows, she performed "I Could Break Your Heart Any Day of the Week" to promote the album. On May 26, 2009, she performed songs from the album at Amoeba Music in Hollywood, together with Viola, the day the album was released by Storefront Records. The album was not released in some territories until 2010 and was not released in Brazil until 2011, two years after its initial release. The album received generally positive reviews. <i>Time</i> magazine called the album "impeccably recorded". An article on the album by <i>Paper</i> magazine said, "Mandy (in the album)... shows real thoughtful and emotional depth." <i>Paper</i> finished by saying that "Moore is a far better musician than she's often given credit for." It debuted at number 25 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling 16,000 copies in the U.S. during the week of its release, and at number 4 on the Top Independent albums chart. To date, the album has sold an estimated 100,000 copies.  The album was recorded just prior to Moore's marriage, and as of 2019, it is Moore's last album.

<p>In July 2012, Moore announced that she would be collaborating with her then-husband, musician Ryan Adams, on her upcoming seventh studio album. She said, "There's tremendous influence right now around the house... from the music I've been introduced to and being very happy and in a healthy, happy relationship… I think that still garners a lot of material to write about." She later said, "There's a lot to say and a lot that's happened to me in the last three or so years since the last record's come out, so I have been writing a lot and it's definitely going to be an intense, emotional record. I'm excited about it. I'm excited to get into the studio and start recording." She also said that she thought the album would be "intense, emotional". On February 20, 2013, it was announced Moore would be starring as Louise in the ABC sitcom <i>Pulling</i>, based on the British sitcom of the same name.

Moore asked to leave the pilot and ABC agreed to it.  In a July 2014 interview with CBS News, Moore said that 2014 was "the year of actual progress forward" on her seventh album and said it was more "dangerous" and "raw" than her previous albums, and said that she hoped to start recording the album in Adams's studio later in the summer; she also revealed that she would appear on Adams's self-titled fourteenth album, <i>Ryan Adams,</i> which was released on September 5, 2014.

<p>When Moore's musical career began in 1999, she was known for her bubblegum pop sound and image, which she revealed was not the type of music she prefers, saying, "[The record company] was like, 'Here are your songs.' I was like, 'Hi, I'm fourteen. I'll do anything.' Those albums are why I'm here today, but god damn, I should give a refund to anyone who bought my first record".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Moore has often been praised by music critics for branching off and writing her own music. <i>Billboard</i> said, "She has successfully dropped all the tacky accoutrements of her past and turned into a sweet, classy singer-songwriter whose charms are readily apparent".
AllMusic said, "Moore smoothly evolved from adolescent starlet to mature songwriter, continuing to distance herself from the scene that had launched her career one decade prior".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>Moore has said that she was inspired by film and television as a child. She has also said, "I'm stuck in the '70s. I think I'll always have that kind of influence. Joni Mitchell, Todd Rundgren, Harry Nilsson, McCartney—that's the sort of stuff I'm really inspired and influenced by". Moore also said how her then-husband, musician Ryan Adams, had a huge influence on her music, and that he introduced her to heavy metal. "Not that I can necessarily differentiate between speed metal and black metal…" she said. "I'll tolerate it, but I turn it down".

<p>Moore's fashion career began in 2005 with her own fashion line called <i>Mblem.</i> that was a brand of contemporary knitwear and cashmere. One of her focuses was to sell clothing for taller women (Moore is 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m)). In February 2009, Moore announced that the line would be discontinued, but that she hoped to return to her fashion career under different circumstances in the future.
