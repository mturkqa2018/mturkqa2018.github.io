<p>"<b>7/11</b>" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé from the reissue of her fifth studio album <i>Beyoncé</i> (2013), subtitled <i>Platinum Edition</i> (2014). It was released on November 25, 2014 by Columbia Records as the second single from the reissue. The song was written by Beyoncé and Alonzo Holt; the latter collaborated with Bobby Johnson during the production process. "7/11" is a trap song with elements of hip hop present in its composition. It features rap-singing vocals by Beyoncé over a warped up-tempo beat.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Upon its release, "7/11" received mixed reviews by music critics, with some of them praising its club-ready and frenetic sound while others criticized its use of auto-tune. Its accompanying music video was premiered through YouTube on November 21, 2014. In it, Beyoncé dances at various locations; the video was filmed by the singer herself using a static camera, with some additional footage created with the aid of a selfie stick.

"7/11" peaked at number 13 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.

<p>"7/11" is an up-tempo hip hop track complete with Auto-Tune. Its production consists of trap, and R&amp;B elements accompanied by a "rattling" bassline. Caitlin White from MTV News noted that it was "all beats and bragging" with Beyoncé's vocals seldomly transferring into her singing voice. Gerrick D. Kennedy from <i>Los Angeles Times</i> likened the singer's rap-singing in a warbly double-time cadence to her early work with the girl group Destiny's Child. "7/11" was also noted for containing Southern rap "swagger." Her vocal performance was further noted for being filled with "intensity" and Nicki Minaj–esque wails while singing the staccato rap verses. Allison Piwowarski opined that the song's title refers to the drinking game "Sevens, Elevens, and Doubles", as the singer hints in lines like "... I'm thinkin' bout that alcohol / Man it feel like rolling dice / seven eleven ... ."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Beyoncé raps commanding and demanding lines throughout accompanied by a "warped" beat, shouting the lyrics: "Smack that, clap that...like you don't care!  [<i>sic</i>]". The singer goes on repetitively describing her dance moves with the lyrics "I put up my hands up, spinning while my hands up... Legs movin' side to side, smack in the air." She uses braggadocio while boasting about "flexin' with my hands up". After two and a half minutes, the songs "breakneck" pace changes into an "atmospheric" outro for the last 60 seconds.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h2>
<p>Critics responded to "7/11" with mixed reviews. 
Bianca Gracie of Idolator criticized it as a "try-hard, club-ready tune" and a leftover of Rihanna's recording session for her album <i>Unapologetic</i> (2012). Gracie further denounced the fact that Beyoncé's vocals were "embarrassingly run through an autotune machine". <i>The Michigan Daily</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Christian Kennedy wrote that the track wouldn't have been suitable for the album's original track listing. He noted that the song was "choppy and in large part does not make much sense" which according to him would trigger many to deem it "a musical mess". Katie Hasty from the website HitFix criticized "7/11" as a "club throwaway [which] isn't likely to move you, even physically"; she went on to compare it with "Mad Libs for people who get bottle service."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>A positive review from Erika Ramirez of <i>Billboard</i> magazine imagined that "7/11" would "spark a dance craze". Colin Stutz from the same publication described it as a "swaggering number". Writing for Fuse, Jeff Benjamin concluded that it was apparent from the song's "hard-hitting, trappy production" that Beyoncé "hasn't lost her edge in between recording sessions". Daniel Kreps from <i>Rolling Stone</i> deemed the song as a "rapid-fire banger" and "frenetic". Joey Guerra of the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> described it as an "irresistible club banger" which "is going to pack dance floors and inspire plenty of moves". Upon hearing a 30-second snippet of "7/11", Nate Jones from the website Vulture concluded that it was "harder than anything on the original album" with Beyoncé bragging and showing various "assorted signs of self-confidence". <i>Spin</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Brennan Carley commented that the song was "warbly rapped" and less interesting than "Ring Off". Caitlin White observed in her review for MTV News that "7/11" headed further than the direction the singer aimed in songs like "Drunk in Love", "Partition" and "Flawless". She added that considering its writers and producers, "[It is] no wonder the track is a veering, experimental club anthem more reminiscent of the initial version of 'Flawless'—'Bow Down/I Been On'."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Justin Davis of <i>Complex</i> magazine positively reviewed the "catchy" song with an "easily repeatable" chorus as a worthy addition to the album's original track list, further adding that it "is sure to be a staple in the clubs". Patrick Ryan of <i>USA Today</i> characterized the refrain as "instantly recognizable". Robin Murray in a review for <i>Clash</i> magazine found an "impeccable" pop production in the song and described it as Beyoncé at her best. Consequence of Sound's Michelle Geslani described "7/11" as "quite the banger", concluding, "If you thought the self-titled LP flaunted unflinching assertiveness, consider this track <i>Beyoncé</i> taken to the next level." <i>Exclaim!</i> editor Josiah Hughes deemed it a "certified banger" filled with heavy trap drums and half-rapped vocals. Gerrick D. Kennedy of <i>Los Angeles Times</i> described the track as "nonsensical fun for the club or treadmill". Kate Hutchinson of <i>The Guardian</i> called "7/11" a "tropi-bomb". In 2014, the song was placed at number 113 on the annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll compiled by <i>The Village Voice</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_video">Music video</span></h2>
<p>On November 21, 2014, a music video for the song was released on Beyoncé's official YouTube account. The clip was shot in the style of a home-made visual with the singer dancing at various locations: patio, balcony, hotel suite, and a bathroom. It was shot on a iPhone camera. It starts with Beyoncé dancing on a balcony dressed with a sweatshirt with the word "Kale", leopard print panties and knee pads; from there it proceeds to a hotel suite. Beyoncé is joined by five female dancers to perform a choreography. Other scenes show her rolling dice on her dancer's buttock and blowing her hair with a dryer. She is also seen getting out of a present box in front of a Christmas tree and dialing a phone number on her foot. The clip finishes with Beyoncé blowing a New Year whistle while wearing glasses shaped in the form of the number 2015. Throughout the whole video, the singer is seen passing through quick cuts and wardrobe changes. The scenes shot at the balcony were filmed using a fisheye camera. Beyoncé's daughter Blue Ivy Carter also makes a cameo appearance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h3>
<p>Jeff Benjamin of Fuse found the singer looking "adorably cute" in the clip. Colin Stutz of <i>Billboard</i> deemed it "awesome" and felt that the singer had "hilariously fun time" in it. Pitchfork Media writer Molly Beauchemin commented that the video gets more interesting from the beginning. Stereogum journalist James Rettig also felt that the "really effective" low-key video "gets progressively crazier". and A writer from <i>Rap-Up</i> summarized the visual as "fun and playful" and full with surprises. Patrick Ryan writing for <i>USA Today</i> likened the song's music video to "Flawless" in terms of the similar potential to become a "viral sensation" due to its club dancing moves "that have since ignited Tumblr with GIFs". <i>Spin</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Andrew Unterberger felt that the "slight and formless" song lacked hooks by Beyoncé's standards; however he noted how its fun and fast-paced video could be enough to keep it as an essential part of the singer's discography and predicted it would end up "be[ing] a thing". Frances Perraudin felt that the video looked as if it was shot with an iPhone which, according to him rendered it a "music video for the selfie generation".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Lindsay Zoladz from Vulture similarly felt that the track seemed like "a bit of a throwaway" until the release of its clip. She emphasized how its video was in line with the overall aim of the album <i>Beyoncé</i> to disassemble the idea of the singer being a perfectionist, but somehow assert she is "a little bit fresher than you". Zoladz concluded her review by summarizing the clip as "aspirational chilling, carefully curated fun, a GoPro feminist utopia... a glorious ode to goofing off with your ladies". Sharan Shetty of <i>Slate</i> viewed the clip as "unusually candid" and "delightfully low-concept" further noticing how despite the acrobatic moves and synchronized twerking, the singer also "injects some dorkiness into her 'woke up like this' image". He described it as the singer's routine on a Friday night and further praised Jay-Z and Blue Ivy's appearances. Justin Block of <i>Complex</i> praised the fact that most of the dance moves were not coordinated enough, further praising Beyoncé for using an "ubiquitous 'selfie-stick' to bring more private moments of her life into the fold". Joey Guerra from the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> felt that the video was not "groundbreaking in any level" but noted it was intentionally not supposed to be. On the other hand, <i>The Michigan Daily</i> writer Christian Kennedy called it revolutionary with "no fear of hyperbole" and went on to describe it as the "most real video she has ever released".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Daniel Kreps from <i>Rolling Stone</i> who felt that unlike the rest of the music videos found on the visual album <i>Beyoncé</i> which seemed like Hollywood production, the clip for "7/11" was "refreshing" and "successfully operate[d] on a low budget". Kreps finished his review calling the "well-shot, spryly edited" video one of the more personal in the singer's career. Caitlin White of MTV News somehow echoed his opinion writing that the intimate clip showed a new side of the singer and contrasted its "carefree, casual vibes" with the rest of the album's choreographed videos. <i>Dose</i> editor Barbara Pavone deemed the personal video "a breath of fresh air" when compared to Beyoncé's other high budget videos and went on to praise her humor, wardrobe and look. Emily Blake writing on behalf of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> pointed out that "7/11" was not "glossy" as the rest of <i>Beyoncé</i> but was "just as fun to watch" by being "playful and casual". She further commented how it looked as if it was filmed in a single afternoon. Idolator's Mike Wass called "7/11" a "mockery" of the singer's big budget videos and went on to highlight the "insane" dance moves throughout.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recognition_and_accolades">Recognition and accolades</span></h3>
<p>The video was included on Pitchfork's list of The 20 Best Music Videos of 2014 with Molly Beauchemin writing that "Beyoncé brings together a host of modern obsessions: GoPros, twerking, kale. Even though the clip is edited to a T, it gives us a glimpse into Bey's life offstage: a hopeless perfectionist goofing off at her leisure." The video won in the category for Video of the Year at the 2015 BET Awards. At the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, "7/11" was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Female Video, Best Pop Video, Best Choreography, and Best Editing, winning the latter.
