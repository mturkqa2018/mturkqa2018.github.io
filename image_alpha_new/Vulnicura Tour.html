<p>The <b>Vulnicura Tour</b> was the eighth concert tour by Icelandic musician Bj√∂rk. The tour centered on her critically acclaimed 2015 album <i>Vulnicura</i> which chronicled the singer's breakup with American contemporary artist Matthew Barney.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The first half of each show featured the first six songs from the album, performed uninterrupted. Following an intermission, Bj√∂rk returned to the stage to perform a collection of songs from her past, newly rearranged to take advantage of the 15 strings players, percussionist and hang drum player Manu Delago, and Arca on electronics. On festival dates The Haxan Cloak performed on electronics, debuting his remix of "Mouth Mantra" at the Governor's Ball in New York.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>To date the Vulnicura Tour remains the second Bj√∂rk concert not to receive a corresponding DVD release, following the Greatest Hits Tour in 2003. None of the 27 concerts are known to have been professionally filmed but a concert in Iceland on 8 November 2016 was, though no plans have been announced for a home video release or TV broadcast.

<p>On 7 January 2015, Bj√∂rk was announced as one of the performers of the 2015 Governors Ball. It was her first confirmed appearance since the conclusion of the Biophilia Tour and her first concert in New York City since 2012.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>On 16 January 2015, the singer confirmed the upcoming Vulnicura Tour by announcing six dates through March and April in New York, where she performed at the Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall and the New York City Center. On Twitter, Bj√∂rk confirmed that Arca would play with her on selected dates. She later added 2 shows at Brooklyn's Kings Theatre sandwiched in between the Carnegie Hall and City Center shows. Alarm Will Sound, a New York-based chamber orchestra, joined Bj√∂rk and Arca on stage, as did Austrian hang drum player and percussionist Manu Delago, who previously toured with Bj√∂rk on <i>Biophilia</i><i>.</i> The Haxan Cloak took over electronic duties from Arca on festival dates in New York and later in Europe, playing a total of six Vulnicura Tour shows.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>On 8 August 2015, Bj√∂rk officially announced the abrupt end of the Vulnicura Tour, stating, "These have truly been some of my most sublime moments!! Singing this album has been intense and the internal clock of it different to the other ones. It has sort of had to behave in its own little way. Both the urgency of the leak and now this sudden closure for reasons beyond my control is characteristic of that. I hope through the years I have earned enough tourkarma points to get your support for this." She added, "I have started writing new songs and feel the best most natural pathway to go is to let this beast flow its natural course and start anew."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Follow_up_acoustic_concerts">Follow up acoustic concerts</span></h3>
<p>On 21 September 2016 Bj√∂rk gave her first acoustic <i>Vulnicura</i> concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and then later at Harpa in Iceland. These strings only shows follow the general format of the original Vulnicura Tour with the first six songs from the album performed uninterrupted with the second half of the show featuring mostly songs from her back catalogue. Of her back catalogue songs, only "Bachelorette" was played during both the original tour and these strings-only shows; all other songs made their <i>Vulnicura</i> era debuts.  She continued the acoustic concert experience in Mexico City on 29 March 2017.  Bj√∂rk made her debut at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles on 30 May 2017 to coincide with the west coast premiere of <i>Bjork Digital</i>.  She performed with the LA Philharmonic and during the show announced that it would be her last concert in support of her 2015 album, <i>Vulnicura</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Bj√∂rk headlined the Ceremonia Festival in Toluca, Mexico on 2 April 2017  where she and Arca played a strings and electronics set and debuted Arca's remix of Bj√∂rk's 1995 song, "Isobel". She performed a similar strings and beats show in downtown Los Angeles at FYF Fest on 21 July 2017 and at Fuji Rock in Japan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>On 20 October 2017, 2 concerts were announced in the country of Georgia, at the Tbilisi Concert Hall on 31 October and at Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater on 3 November.  Backed by the National Symphonic Orchestra of Georgia, both nights saw Bj√∂rk perform songs from her 2015 album <i>Vulnicura</i> despite announcing the end of the tour in Los Angeles back on 30 May 2017. Although the first single from her new album <i>Utopia</i>, "The Gate", had already been released at the time (on 15 September 2017), the song was not performed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<p>The Vulnicura Tour was universally acclaimed by critics. It opened on 7 March 2015 at Carnegie Hall; Bj√∂rk walked on stage to thunderous applause wearing a dress with motorized fabric chest wound by Iris Van Herpen and sporting a headpiece designed by Maiko Takeda. Billboard.com wrote of the show, "Bj√∂rk has not been shy about the personal woes that inspired <i>Vulnicura</i>, and to see her declare "I am not hurt" to a sold-out audience made for a truly inspiring moment." Patrick Ryan of USA Today said, "Although her face wasn't visible for the first hour, she couldn't have been more expressive as she worked her way through <i>Vulnicura</i>, starting with the sweeping, reflective "Stonemilker"; and proceeding into the exotic, slithering strings of "Lionsong"<i>...</i> Starting with "Pleasure is All Mine" off 2004's <i>Med√∫lla</i>, the subsequent "Come to Me", "Undo" and "I See Who You Are" were all met with bursts of knowing cheers from the crowd. Bjork returned without a mask and wearing a custom lilac latex dress by Geoffrey Mac for the second act. If the first half felt like a soundtrack for the chilly, winter's day outside Carnegie Hall, these more vibrant numbers were like spring creeping around the corner." He added, "For this reviewer (who was only minimally familiar with Bj√∂rk's catalog and <i>Vulnicura</i> before the concert), it didn't feel like anything was lost being a relative newcomer to her work. She's just that dynamic of a live performer."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The tour received equally glowing reviews when it moved to Europe months later. Writing about Bj√∂rk's European debut at the Manchester International Festival, The Telegraph wrote, "Bj√∂rk doesn't do (a) break-up (album) like anyone else" and that the singer "proved that she's capable of transmuting despair into a very singular form of rapture." Similarly, The Guardian wrote, "<i>Vulnicura</i> contains the sort of personal thoughts and details that few stars would confide to their psychiatrist, never mind perform to more than 5,000 people in an open-air urban amphitheatre. Her lyrics hit home like nails in the coffin of something that was precious. "Maybe he will come out of this loving me," she muses, as doubt bleeds into fury. "I honoured my feelings. You betrayed your own heart," she snaps in the bleakly devastating "Black Lake", as percussionist Manu Delago drops what sound like sonic bombs."

<p>The following is a list of songs performed by Bj√∂rk during the Vulnicura Tour. A typical set list from the show consisted of the first 6 songs from the <i>Vulnicura</i> album during the concert's first half, and a second half consisting of songs from her back catalogue. As she often does, the festival dates featured more of her greatest hits, including "Army of Me" and "Bachelorette".
