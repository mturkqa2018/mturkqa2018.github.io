<p><b>Gilbert Scott-Heron</b> (April 1, 1949 â€“ May 27, 2011) was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author, known primarily for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was "bluesologist", which he defined as "a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>His music, most notably on the albums <i>Pieces of a Man</i> and <i>Winter in America</i> in the early 1970s, influenced and foreshadowed later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. Scott-Heron is considered by many to be the first rapper/MC ever. His recording work received much critical acclaim, especially one of his best-known compositions, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised". AllMusic's John Bush called him "one of the most important progenitors of rap music," stating that "his aggressive, no-nonsense street poetry inspired a legion of intelligent rappers while his engaging songwriting skills placed him square in the R&amp;B charts later in his career."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled <i>I'm New Here</i>. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, <i>The Last Holiday</i>, was published posthumously in January 2012. Scott-Heron received a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He also is included in the exhibits at the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) that officially opened on September 24, 2016, on the National Mall, and in an NMAAHC publication, <i>Dream a World Anew</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Gil Scott-Heron was born in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Bobbie Scott, was an opera singer who performed with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron's father, Gil Heron, nicknamed "The Black Arrow", was a Jamaican soccer player in the 1950s who became the first black man to play for Celtic Football Club in Glasgow. Gil's parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in The Bronx in New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School, but later transferred to The Fieldston School after impressing the head of the English department with one of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him, "'How would you feel if you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And [he] said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'" This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron's later recordings.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>After completing his secondary education, Scott-Heron decided to attend Lincoln University in Pennsylvania because Langston Hughes (his most important literary influence) was an alumnus. It was here that Scott-Heron met Brian Jackson with whom he formed the band Black &amp; Blues. After about two years at Lincoln, Scott-Heron took a year off to write the novels <i>The Vulture</i> and <i>The Nigger Factory</i>. Scott-Heron was very heavily influenced by the Black Arts Movement. The Last Poets, a group associated with the Black Arts Movement performed at Lincoln in 1969 and Abiodun Oyewole of that Harlem group said Scott-Heron asked him after the performance, "Listen, can I start a group like you guys?" Scott-Heron returned to New York City, settling in Chelsea, Manhattan. <i>The Vulture</i> was published by the World Publishing Company in 1970 to positive reviews.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Although Scott-Heron never completed his undergraduate degree, he was admitted to the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University, where he received an M.A. in creative writing in 1972. His master's thesis was titled <i>Circle of Stone</i>. Beginning in 1972, Scott-Heron taught literature and creative writing for several years as a full-time lecturer at Federal City College in Washington, D.C. while maintaining his music career.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recording_career">Recording career</span></h2>
<p>Scott-Heron began his recording career in 1970 with the LP <i>Small Talk at 125th and Lenox</i>. Bob Thiele of Flying Dutchman Records produced the album, and Scott-Heron was accompanied by Eddie Knowles and Charlie Saunders on conga and David Barnes on percussion and vocals. The album's 14 tracks dealt with themes such as the superficiality of television and mass consumerism, the hypocrisy of some would-be black revolutionaries, and white middle-class ignorance of the difficulties faced by inner-city residents. In the liner notes, Scott-Heron acknowledged as influences Richie Havens, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Jose Feliciano, Billie Holiday, Langston Hughes, Malcolm X, Huey Newton, Nina Simone, and long-time collaborator Brian Jackson.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Scott-Heron's 1971 album <i>Pieces of a Man</i> used more conventional song structures than the loose, spoken-word feel of <i>Small Talk</i>. He was joined by Jackson, Johnny Pate as conductor, Ron Carter on bass and bass guitar, drummer Bernard "Pretty" Purdie, Burt Jones playing electric guitar, and Hubert Laws on flute and saxophone, with Thiele producing again. Scott-Heron's third album, <i>Free Will</i>, was released in 1972. Jackson, Purdie, Laws, Knowles, and Saunders all returned to play on <i>Free Will</i> and were joined by Jerry Jemmott playing bass, David Spinozza on guitar, and Horace Ott (arranger and conductor). Carter later said about Scott-Heron's voice: "He wasn't a great singer, but, with that voice, if he had whispered it would have been dynamic. It was a voice like you would have for Shakespeare."

<p>1974 saw another LP collaboration with Brian Jackson, the critically acclaimed opus <i>Winter in America</i>, with Bob Adams on drums and Danny Bowens on bass. The album contained Scott-Heron's most cohesive material and featured more of Jackson's creative input than his previous albums had. <i>Winter in America</i> has been regarded by many critics as the two musicians' most artistic effort. The following year, Scott-Heron and Jackson released <i>Midnight Band: The First Minute of a New Day</i>. 1975 saw the release of the single "Johannesburg", a rallying cry to the issue of apartheid in South Africa. The song would be re-issued, in 12"-single form, together with "Waiting for the Axe to Fall" and "B-movie" in 1983.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>A live album, <i>It's Your World</i>, followed in 1976 and a recording of spoken poetry, <i>The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron</i>, was released in 1979. Another success followed with the hit single "Angel Dust", which he recorded as a single with producer Malcolm Cecil. "Angel Dust" peaked at No. 15 on the R&amp;B charts in 1978.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 1979, Scott-Heron played at the No Nukes concerts at Madison Square Garden. The concerts were organized by Musicians United for Safe Energy to protest the use of nuclear energy following the Three Mile Island accident. Scott-Heron's song, "We Almost Lost Detroit" was included in the <i>No Nukes</i> album of concert highlights. It alluded to a previous nuclear power plant accident and was also the title of a book by John G. Fuller. Scott-Heron was a frequent critic of President Ronald Reagan and his conservative policies.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Scott-Heron recorded and released four albums during the 1980s: <i>1980</i> and <i>Real Eyes</i> (1980), <i>Reflections</i> (1981) and <i>Moving Target</i> (1982). In February 1982, Ron Holloway joined the ensemble to play tenor saxophone. He toured extensively with Scott-Heron and contributed to his next album, <i>Moving Target</i> the same year. His tenor accompaniment is a prominent feature of the songs "Fast Lane" and "Black History/The World". Holloway continued with Scott-Heron until the summer of 1989, when he left to join Dizzy Gillespie. Several years later, Scott-Heron would make cameo appearances on two of Ron Holloway's CDs; <i>Scorcher</i> (1996) and <i>Groove Update</i> (1998), both on the Fantasy/Milestone label.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>
Scott-Heron was dropped by Arista Records in 1985 and quit recording, though he continued to tour. The same year he helped compose and sang "Let Me See Your I.D." on the Artists United Against Apartheid album <i>Sun City</i>, containing the famous line, "The first time I heard there was trouble in the Middle East, I thought they were talking about Pittsburgh". The song compares racial tensions in the U.S. with those in apartheid-era South Africa, implying that the U.S. was not too far ahead in race relations. In 1993, he signed to TVT Records and released <i>Spirits</i>, an album that included the seminal track "'Message to the Messengers". The first track on the album criticized the rap artists of the day. Scott-Heron is known in many circles as "the Godfather of rap" and is widely considered to be one of the genre's founding fathers. Given the political consciousness that lies at the foundation of his work, he can also be called a founder of political rap. <i>Message to the Messengers</i> was a plea for the new generation of rappers to speak for change rather than perpetuate the current social situation, and to be more articulate and artistic. Regarding hip hop music in the 1990s, he said in an interview: <style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r886047036">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>They need to study music.

<p>In 2001, Scott-Heron was sentenced to one to three years imprisonment in a New York State prison for possession of cocaine. While out of jail in 2002, he appeared on the <i>Blazing Arrow</i> album by Blackalicious. He was released on parole in 2003, the year BBC TV broadcast the documentary <i>Gil Scott-Heron: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</i>â€”Scott-Heron was arrested for possession of a crack pipe during the editing of the film in October 2003 and received a six-month prison sentence.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>On July 5, 2006, Scott-Heron was sentenced to two to four years in a New York State prison for violating a plea deal on a drug-possession charge by leaving a drug rehabilitation center. He claimed that he left because the clinic refused to supply him with HIV medication. This story led to the presumption that the artist was HIV positive, subsequently confirmed in a 2008 interview. Originally sentenced to serve until July 13, 2009, he was paroled on May 23, 2007.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>After his release, Scott-Heron began performing live again, starting with a show at SOB's restaurant and nightclub in New York on September 13, 2007. On stage, he stated that he and his musicians were working on a new album and that he had resumed writing a book titled <i>The Last Holiday</i>, previously on long-term hiatus, about Stevie Wonder and his successful attempt to have the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. declared a federally recognized holiday in the United States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Malik Al Nasir dedicated a collection of poetry to Scott-Heron titled <i>Ordinary Guy</i> that contained a foreword by Jalal Mansur Nuriddin of The Last Poets. Scott-Heron recorded one of the poems in Nasir's book entitled <i>Black &amp; Blue</i> in 2006.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In April 2009, on BBC Radio 4, poet Lemn Sissay presented a half-hour documentary on Gil Scott-Heron entitled <i>Pieces of a Man</i>, having interviewed Gil Scott-Heron in New York a month earlier. <i>Pieces of a Man</i> was the first UK announcement from Scott-Heron of his forthcoming album and return to form. In November 2009, the BBC's <i>Newsnight</i> interviewed Scott-Heron for a feature titled <i>The Legendary Godfather of Rap Returns</i>. In 2009, a new Gil Scott-Heron website, gilscottheron.net, was launched with a new track "Where Did the Night Go" made available as a free download from the site.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In 2010, Scott-Heron was booked to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, but this attracted criticism from pro-Palestinian activists, who stated: "Your performance in Israel would be the equivalent to having performed in Sun City during South Africa's apartheid era... We hope that you will not play apartheid Israel". Scott-Heron responded by canceling the performance.

<p>Scott-Heron released his album <i>I'm New Here</i> on independent label XL Recordings on February 9, 2010. Produced by XL label owner Richard Russell, <i>I'm New Here</i> was Scott-Heron's first studio album in 16 years. The pair started recording the album in 2007, with the majority of the record being recorded over the 12 months leading up to the release date with engineer Lawson White at Clinton Studios in New York. <i>I'm New Here</i> is 28 minutes long with 15 tracks; however, casual asides and observations collected during recording sessions are included as interludes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>The album attracted critical acclaim, with <i>The Guardian</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Jude Rogers declaring it one of the "best of the next decade", while some have called the record "reverent" and "intimate", due to Scott-Heron's half-sung, half-spoken delivery of his poetry. In a music review for public radio network NPR, Will Hermes stated: "Comeback records always worry me, especially when they're made by one of my heroes ... But I was haunted by this record ... He's made a record not without hope but which doesn't come with any easy or comforting answers. In that way, the man is clearly still committed to speaking the truth". Writing for music website <i>Music OMH</i>, Darren Lee provided a more mixed assessment of the album, describing it as rewarding and stunning, but he also states that the album's brevity prevents it "from being an unassailable masterpiece".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Scott-Heron described himself as a mere participant in an interview with <i>The New Yorker</i>:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
This is Richard's CD. My only knowledge when I got to the studio was how he seemed to have wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage meâ€”why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The remix version of the album, <i>We're New Here</i>, was released in 2011, featuring production by English musician Jamie xx, who reworked material from the original album. Like the original album, <i>We're New Here</i> received critical acclaim.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>In April 2014, XL Recordings announced a third album from the <i>I'm New Here</i> sessions, titled <i>Nothing New</i>. The album consists of stripped-down piano and vocal recordings and was released in conjunction with Record Store Day on April 19, 2014.

<div class="quotebox-quote left-aligned" style="">"Gil Scott-Heron released poems as songs, recorded songs that were based on his earliest poems and writings, wrote novels and became a hero to many for his music, activism and his anger. There is always the anger â€“ an often beautiful, passionate anger. An often awkward anger. A very soulful anger. And often it is a very sad anger. But it is the pervasive mood, theme and feeling within his work â€“ and around his work, hovering, piercing, occasionally weighing down; often lifting the work up, helping to place it in your face. And for all the preaching and warning signs in his work, the last two decades of Gil Scott-Heron's life to date have seen him succumb to the pressures and demons he has so often warned others about."</div>

</div>
<p>Scott-Heron died on the afternoon of May 27, 2011, at St. Luke's Hospital, New York City, after becoming ill upon returning from a European trip. Scott-Heron had confirmed previous press speculation about his health, when he disclosed in a 2008 <i>New York Magazine</i> interview that he had been HIV-positive for several years, and that he had been previously hospitalized for pneumonia.

<p>He is survived by his firstborn daughter, Raquiyah "Nia" Kelly Heron, from his relationship with Pat Kelly; his son Rumal Rackley, from his relationship with Lurma Rackley; daughter Gia Scott-Heron, from his marriage to Brenda Sykes; and daughter  Chegianna Newton, who was 13 years old at the time of her father's death. He is also survived by his sister Gayle; brother Denis Heron, who once managed Scott-Heron; his uncle, Roy Heron; and nephew Terrance Kelly, an actor and rapper who performs as Mr. Cheeks, and who was a member of Lost Boyz.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Before his death, Scott-Heron had been in talks with Portuguese director Pedro Costa to participate in his film <i>Horse Money</i> as a screenwriter, composer and actor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>After Scott-Heron's death, Malik Al Nasir told his story to <i>The Guardian</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Simon Hattenstone of the kindness that Scott-Heron had showed Malik throughout his adult life since meeting the poet back stage at a gig in Liverpool in 1984. The BBC World Service covered the story on their <i>Outlook</i> program with Matthew Bannister, which took the story global. It was subsequently covered in other media such as BBC Radio 4's <i>Saturday Live</i>, where jazz musician Al Jarreau paid tribute to Gil, and was mentioned the U.S. edition of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>The Huffington Post</i>. Malik &amp; the O.G's performed a tribute to Scott-Heron at the Liverpool International Music Festival in 2013 with jazz composer Orphy Robinson of The Jazz Warriors and Rod Youngs from Gil's band The Amnesia Express. Another tribute was performed at St. Georges Hall in Liverpool on August 27, 2015, called "The Revolution will be Live!", curated by Malik Al Nasir and Richard McGinnis for Yesternight Productions. The event featured Talib Kweli, Aswad, The Christians, Malik &amp; the O.G's, Sophia Ben-Yousef and Cleveland Watkiss as well as DJ 2Kind and poet, actor, and radio DJ Craig Charles. The tribute was the opening event for 2015 Liverpool International Music Festival.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>In response to Scott-Heron's death, Public Enemy's Chuck D stated "RIP GSH...and we do what we do and how we do because of you" on his Twitter account. His UK publisher, Jamie Byng, called him "one of the most inspiring people I've ever met". On hearing of the death, R&amp;B singer Usher stated: "I just learned of the loss of a very important poet...R.I.P., Gil Scott-Heron. The revolution will be live!!". Richard Russell, who produced Scott-Heron's final studio album, called him a "father figure of sorts to me", while Eminem stated: "He influenced all of hip-hop". Lupe Fiasco wrote a poem about Scott-Heron that was published on his website.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>Scott-Heron's memorial service was held at Riverside Church in New York City on June 2, 2011, where Kanye West performed "Lost in the World" and "Who Will Survive in America", two songs from West's album <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>. The studio album version of West's "Who Will Survive in America" features a spoken-word excerpt by Scott-Heron. Scott-Heron is buried at Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County in New York.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Scott-Heron was honored posthumously in 2012 by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Charlotte Fox, member of the Washington, DC NARAS and president of Genesis Poets Music, nominated Scott-Heron for the award, while the letter of support came from Grammy award winner and Grammy Hall of Fame inductee Bill Withers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>Scott-Heron's memoir, <i>The Last Holiday</i>, was released in January 2012. In her review for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, professor of English and journalism Lynell George wrote:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The Last Holiday</i> is as much about his life as it is about context, the theater of late 20th century America â€” from Jim Crow to the Reagan '80s and from Beale Street to 57th Street. The narrative is not, however, a rise-and-fall retelling of Scott-Heron's life and career. It doesn't connect all the dots. It moves off-the-beat, at its own speed ... This approach to revelation lends the book an episodic quality, like oral storytelling does. It winds around, it repeats itself.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p></blockquote>
<h3><span id="Scott-Heron.27s_estate"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Scott-Heron's_estate">Scott-Heron's estate</span></h3>
<p>At the time of Scott-Heron's death, a will could not be found to determine the future of his estate. Additionally, Raquiyah Kelly-Heron filed papers in Manhattan, New York's Surrogate's Court in August 2013, claiming that Rumal Rackley is not Scott-Heron's son and should therefore be omitted from matters concerning the musician's estate.
According to the <i>Daily News</i> website, Rackley, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate, as Rackley stated in court papers that Scott-Heron prepared him to be the eventual administrator of the estate. 
Scott-Heron's 1994 album <i>Spirits</i> was dedicated to "my son Rumal and my daughters Nia and Gia", and in court papers Rackley added that Scott-Heron introduced me [Rackley] from the stage as his son."
.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>In 2011, Rackley filed a suit against sister Gia Scott-Heron and her mother, Scott-Heron's first wife, Brenda Sykes, as he believed they had unfairly attained US$250,000 of Scott-Heron's money. The case was later settled for an undisclosed sum in early 2013; but the relationship between Rackley and Scott-Heron's two adult daughters already had become strained in the months after Gil's death. 
In her submission to the Surrogate's Court, Kelly-Heron states that a DNA test completed by Rackley in 2011â€”using DNA from Scott-Heron's brotherâ€”revealed that they "do not share a common male lineage", while Rackley has refused to undertake another DNA test since that time. A hearing to address Kelly-Heron's filing was scheduled for late August 2013, but by March 2016 further information on the matter was not publicly available. Rackley still serves as court-appointed administrator for the estate, and donated material to the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture for Scott-Heron to be included among the exhibits and displays when the museum opened in September 2016. In December 2018, the Surrogate Court ruled that Rumal Rackley and his half sisters are all legal heirs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>According to the <i>Daily News</i> website, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate. 
During the time Scott-Heron's 1994 album <i>Spirits</i> was being produced, he was living in Brooklyn, New York, with Nia and her mother.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Influence_and_legacy">Influence and legacy</span></h2>
<p>Scott-Heron's work has influenced writers, academics and musicians, from indie rockers to rappers. His work during the 1970s influenced and helped engender subsequent African-American music genres, such as hip hop and neo soul. He has been described by music writers as "the godfather of rap" and "the black Bob Dylan".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p><i>Chicago Tribune</i> writer Greg Kot comments on Scott-Heron's collaborative work with Jackson:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
Together they crafted jazz-influenced soul and funk that brought new depth and political consciousness to '70s music alongside Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. In classic albums such as <span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span><i>Winter in America</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span> and <span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span><i>From South Africa to South Carolina</i>,<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span> Scott-Heron took the news of the day and transformed it into social commentary, wicked satire, and proto-rap anthems. He updated his dispatches from the front lines of the inner city on tour, improvising lyrics with an improvisational daring that matched the jazz-soul swirl of the music".<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Of Scott-Heron's influence on hip hop, Kot writes that he "presag[ed] hip-hop and infus[ed] soul and jazz with poetry, humor and pointed political commentary". Ben Sisario of <i>The New York Times</i> writes that "He [Scott-Heron] preferred to call himself a "bluesologist", drawing on the traditions of blues, jazz and Harlem renaissance poetics". Tris McCall of <i>The Star-Ledger</i> writes that "The arrangements on Gil Scott-Heron's early recordings were consistent with the conventions of jazz poetry â€“ the movement that sought to bring the spontaneity of live performance to the reading of verse". A music writer later noted that "Scott-Heron's unique proto-rap style influenced a generation of hip-hop artists", while <i>The Washington Post</i> wrote that "Scott-Heron's work presaged not only conscious rap and poetry slams, but also acid jazz, particularly during his rewarding collaboration with composer-keyboardist-flutist Brian Jackson in the mid- and late '70s". <i>The Observer</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Sean O'Hagan discussed the significance of Scott-Heron's music with Brian Jackson, stating:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
Together throughout the 1970s, Scott-Heron and Jackson made music that reflected the turbulence, uncertainty and increasing pessimism of the times, merging the soul and jazz traditions and drawing on an oral poetry tradition that reached back to the blues and forward to hip-hop. The music sounded by turns angry, defiant and regretful while Scott-Heron's lyrics possessed a satirical edge that set them apart from the militant soul of contemporaries such as Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Will Layman of PopMatters wrote about the significance of Scott-Heron's early musical work:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
In the early 1970s, Gil Scott-Heron popped onto the scene as a soul poet with jazz leanings; not just another Bill Withers, but a political voice with a poet's skill. His spoken-voice work had punch and topicality. "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" and "Johannesburg" were calls to action: Stokely Carmichael if he'd had the groove of Ray Charles. 'The Bottle' was a poignant story of the streets: Richard Wright as sung by a husky-voiced Marvin Gaye. To paraphrase Chuck D, Gil Scott-Heron's music was a kind of CNN for black neighborhoods, prefiguring hip-hop by several years. It grew from the Last Poets, but it also had the funky swing of Horace Silver or Herbie Hancockâ€”or Otis Redding. <i>Pieces of a Man</i> and <i>Winter in America</i> (collaborations with Brian Jackson) were classics beyond category".<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Scott-Heron's influence over hip hop is primarily exemplified by his definitive single "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", sentiments from which have been explored by various rappers, including Aesop Rock, Talib Kweli and Common. In addition to his vocal style, Scott-Heron's indirect contributions to rap music extend to his and co-producer Jackson's compositions, which have been sampled by various hip-hop artists. "We Almost Lost Detroit" was sampled by Brand Nubian member Grand Puba ("Keep On"), Native Tongues duo Black Star ("Brown Skin Lady"), and MF Doom ("Camphor"). Additionally, Scott-Heron's 1980 song "A Legend in His Own Mind" was sampled on Mos Def's "Mr. Nigga", the opening lyrics from his 1978 recording "Angel Dust" were appropriated by rapper RBX on the 1996 song "Blunt Time" by Dr. Dre, and CeCe Peniston's 2000 song "My Boo" samples Scott-Heron's 1974 recording "The Bottle".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>In addition to the Scott-Heron excerpt used in "Who Will Survive in America", Kanye West sampled Scott-Heron and Jackson's "Home is Where the Hatred Is" and "We Almost Lost Detroit" for the songs "My Way Home" and "The People", respectively, both of which are collaborative efforts with Common. Scott-Heron, in turn, acknowledged West's contributions, sampling the latter's 2007 single "Flashing Lights" on his final album, 2010's <i>I'm New Here</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>Scott-Heron admitted ambivalence regarding his association with rap, remarking in 2010 in an interview for the <i>Daily Swarm</i>: "I don't know if I can take the blame for [rap music]". As <i>New York Times</i> writer Sisario explained, he preferred the moniker of "bluesologist". Referring to reviews of his last album and references to him as the "godfather of rap", Scott-Heron said: "It's something that's aimed at the kids ... I have kids, so I listen to it. But I would not say it's aimed at me. I listen to the jazz station." In 2013, Chattanooga rapper Isaiah Rashad recorded an unofficial mixtape called Pieces of a Kid, which was greatly influenced by Heron's debut album Pieces of a Man.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Following Scott-Heron's funeral in 2011, a tribute from publisher, record company owner, poet, and music producer Abdul Malik Al Nasir was published on <i>The Guardian</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s website, titled "Gil Scott-Heron saved my life".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>In the 2018 film <i>First Man</i>, Scott-Heron is a minor character and is played by soul singer Leon Bridges.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>He is one of eight significant people shown in mosaic at the 167th Street renovated subway station on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx that reopened in 2019.
