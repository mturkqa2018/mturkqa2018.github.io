<p>Wilson redshirted during the 2007 season at NC State. In 2008, Wilson initially split time at quarterback with senior Daniel Evans and junior Harrison Beck. However, Evans and Beck saw no regular season action after Week 2 and Week 5, respectively. Thereafter, Wilson led the team to a 4â€“3 record in the regular season which NC State finished out on a four-game winning streak. During a win over East Carolina, Wilson threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He threw for two touchdowns in each of the last six games in the regular season.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl against Rutgers, Wilson threw for 186 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 46 yards before halftime. Late in the first half, he scrambled to the Rutgers' four-yard line, where he was tackled and suffered a knee sprain. With Wilson sitting out the remainder of the game, his replacements threw a combined total of three interceptions with NC State eventually losing, 23â€“29. Over the course of the season, he completed 150 of 275 attempts for 1,955 yards and 17 touchdowns with just one interception. He also recorded 116 carries for 394 yards and four touchdowns. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) named him the first-team All-ACC quarterback. It was the first time in the conference's history that a freshman quarterback was named to the first team.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Prior to the 2009 season, Wilson was named as the quarterback on the pre-season all-ACC football team on July 12. On September 19, Wilson broke Andre Woodson's all-time NCAA record of 325 consecutive pass attempts without an interception against Gardnerâ€“Webb. The 379-pass streak ended in a game against Wake Forest on October 3. Wilson held the record until November 10, 2012, when it was broken by Louisiana Tech quarterback Colby Cameron. Wilson was named honorable mention All-ACC in 2009.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Wilson led the 2010 Wolfpack to a 9â€“4 season that included a 23â€“7 win over West Virginia in the 2010 Champs Sports Bowl. He led the ACC in passing yards per game (274.1) and total offensive yards per game (307.5). He was named second-team All-ACC and runner-up for ACC Football Player of the Year. In May 2010, Wilson graduated from NC State in three years with a BA in communication, and took graduate-level business courses in the fall semester during the 2010 football season.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transfer">Transfer</span></h4>
<p>In January 2011, Wilson announced that he would report to spring training with the Colorado Rockies organization. NC State head coach Tom O'Brien expressed reservations with Wilson's decision, saying "Russell and I have had very open conversations about his responsibilities respective to baseball and football. While I am certainly respectful of Russell's dedication to baseball these last several years, within those discussions I also communicated to him the importance of his time commitment to NC State football."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>O'Brien and his staff reached out to NFL coaches and general managers on Wilson's behalf, but he failed to receive an invitation to the 2011 NFL Scouting Combine.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>On April 29, 2011, O'Brien announced that Wilson had been granted a release from his football scholarship with one year of eligibility remaining.

<p>On June 27, 2011, Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema announced that Wilson had committed to Wisconsin for the 2011 season. In the season opener against UNLV, Wilson passed for 255 yards and two passing touchdowns in a 51â€“17 victory. He also rushed for 62 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown run. At the end of the regular season, Wilson was named first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and media. He also won the Griese-Brees Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game on December 3, Wilson threw for three touchdowns and led the Badgers to a 42â€“39 win over the Michigan State Spartans. Wilson was named the game's Grange-Griffin MVP. In December 2011, Wilson was named a third team All-American by Yahoo! Sports, and he finished ninth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy with 52 points.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In the 2012 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks on January 2, 2012, Wilson had 19 pass completions on 25 attempts for 296 yards, 18 rushing yards, and 3 touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing) as the Badgers lost by a score of 38â€“45. Wilson finished the season with 33 passing touchdowns, which set the single season record at Wisconsin and was the second-most in Big Ten history behind Drew Brees during the 1998 season at Purdue (39). Wilson also set the single season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8). On January 28, 2012, Wilson completed his college football career at the 2012 Senior Bowl.

<p>On January 16, 2012, Wilson began training for the NFL Scouting Combine at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Prior to the 2012 NFL Draft, Wilson had been projected by NFL scouts and analysts to be a middle-round pick. In February 2012, former NFL quarterback and director of the IMG Madden Football Academy Chris Weinke said of Wilson, "If he was 6â€“5, he'd probably be the No. 1 pick in the draft." On April 11, 2012, ESPN <i>Monday Night Football</i> analyst Jon Gruden said, "The only issue with Russell Wilson is his height. That might be the reason he's not picked in the first couple rounds."

<p>On April 27, 2012, Wilson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (75th pick overall) of the draft. He was the sixth quarterback to be selected that year. The Seahawks received significant criticism for their selections in the 2012 draft, and for picking Wilson in particular, as the Seahawks had just signed free agent Matt Flynn. Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seahawks on May 7, 2012. He made his preseason debut against the Tennessee Titans on August 11, 2012 and had his first preseason start on August 24 against the Kansas City Chiefs.
On August 26, 2012, Wilson was named the starting quarterback for the first regular season game after competing with Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson for the position.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>On September 9, 2012, Wilson made his regular season debut in a 20â€“16 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He had 18 completions on 34 passing attempts for 153 yards, one passing touchdown, and one interception. In the third regular season game, the Seahawks won 14â€“12 against the Green Bay Packers on a controversial hail mary touchdown pass to Golden Tate. The contentious nature of the replacement officials' decision on the play was widely considered to have been the tipping point that led to an agreement being reached to end the 2012 NFL referee lockout.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Wilson earned the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honors for his stellar week 10 performance in a 28â€“7 victory over the New York Jets. He had 12 completions on 19 attempts for 188 yards and two touchdowns, along with 7 rushing attempts for 34 yards. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week and FedEx Air Player of the Week for his week 13 performance in the 23â€“17 win over the Chicago Bears. On December 16, in a 50â€“17 victory over the Buffalo Bills, he had 205 passing yards, one passing touchdown, nine rushes, 92 rushing yards, and a career-high three rushing touchdowns. He earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month honors for December 2012 after the Seahawks went 5â€“0 and he had a passer rating of 115.2.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Wilson finished the 2012 regular season ranked fourth in the NFL in passer rating (100.0), beating the previous rookie record set by Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 (98.1), since broken by Robert Griffin III in 2012 (102.4) and Dak Prescott in 2016 (104.9). He threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns, tying Peyton Manning's record for most touchdowns thrown by a rookie, and rushed for 489 yards and four touchdowns. Wilson's scrambling mobility and ability to extend plays outside the pocket with his legs earned numerous comparisons to Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Wilson led the Seahawks to the postseason in his rookie year. He made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round against the Washington Redskins, passing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards as the Seahawks rallied for a 24â€“14 comeback victory. In the Divisional Round against the Atlanta Falcons, Wilson threw for 385 yards and rushed for 60 yards, but the Seahawks lost by a score of 28â€“30.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Wilson was selected as an alternate for the 2013 Pro Bowl, filling in for Matt Ryan. At the Pro Bowl, Wilson threw 8 completions on 10 attempts for 98 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 147.1 rating.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>At the end of the season, Wilson earned a bonus of $222,000 through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.

<p>Wilson's Seahawks opened the 2013 season with the first 4â€“0 start in franchise history, after which they lost to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5. The Seahawks then went on a 7-game winning streak, including a 41â€“20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings where he posted a career-high 151.4 passer rating and culminating in a 34â€“7 victory over the Saints in Week 13 in which Wilson threw three touchdown passes and earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award. Over the next three weeks, the Seahawks suffered divisional losses to the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals (the loss to the Cardinals represented Wilson's first home loss as quarterback for the Seahawks), but defeated the Rams in Week 17 to finish the season with a 13â€“3 record, the NFC West title, and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. Wilson finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, 9 interceptions, and a 101.2 passer rating, becoming the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post a 100+ passer rating in each of his first two seasons. Wilson was named to his second Pro Bowl on December 27, 2013. In the Divisional Round, the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints by a score of 23â€“15. On January 19, 2014, Wilson and the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship by a score of 23â€“17, advancing to Super Bowl XLVIII. Wilson threw for 206 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 123.1 passer rating in a 43â€“8 rout of the Denver Broncos. With the victory, Wilson became just the second black starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Super Bowl XXII winner Doug Williams. At 5'11" tall, he also became the shortest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, shorter than Len Dawson, Joe Theismann, and Drew Brees (all 6'0").
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Wilson earned a bonus of $169,141.73 for the 2013 season through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.

<p>On September 21, 2014, Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard touchdown drive in overtime to defeat the Denver Broncos, 26â€“20, in a Week 3 rematch of the previous season's Super Bowl. On October 6, 2014, against the Washington Redskins, Wilson set a new <i>Monday Night Football</i> record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game with 122.
The Seahawks clinched a playoff spot in Week 16 when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of  42â€“7, eliminating the Philadelphia Eagles from postseason contention and allowing the Seahawks to clinch before their <i>Sunday Night Football</i> matchup. On December 21, 2014, Wilson went 20-of-31 and threw for a then-career high 339 yards with two touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals in a primetime matchup on <i>Sunday Night Football</i>. Wilson also led the offense in gaining 596 yards, setting a franchise record for most yards gained in a game. The Cardinals had the third best scoring defense heading into Week 16. The Seahawks won 35â€“6 as they snapped the Cardinals' seven-game home winning streak and regained first place in the NFC West as well as the NFC's #1 seed. The Seahawks defeated the St. Louis Rams 20â€“6 in Week 17 to clinch the NFC West and the #1 seed for the second consecutive season, securing homefield advantage for the entirety of the NFC playoffs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Wilson led the Seahawks to a 31â€“17 home win over the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional Round, making the Seahawks the first defending Super Bowl Champion to win a playoff game since the 2005 Patriots.

Wilson threw 3 first half interceptions while completing only two passes to his own team as the Seahawks fell behind 16â€“0 at halftime. With the Packers leading 19â€“7 and five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Wilson threw his fourth interception. From that point onward, Wilson led the Seahawks on an improbable comeback. On the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson ran the ball in for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 19â€“14. After a successful onside kick recovery, Wilson led the Seahawks down the field, and Lynch ran in to give the Seahawks a 20â€“19 lead. Wilson completed a 15-yard two-point conversion pass to Luke Willson to make it 22â€“19 Seahawks. The Packers tied it up with a field goal at the end of regulation and forced overtime. The Seahawks won the coin toss, and the offense took the field. Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard drive that was capped by a 35-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Kearse. The Seahawks completed their largest postseason comeback in franchise history as they clinched a Super Bowl berth.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>The Seahawks became the first defending champion to return to the Super Bowl since the 2004 Patriots. They faced the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, where they were defeated by a final score of 28â€“24. Although the Seahawks led 24â€“14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots scored two consecutive touchdowns as they took a four-point lead with 2:02 remaining. Wilson led the Seahawks to the Patriots' one-yard line with 25 seconds remaining, but Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass intended for Ricardo Lockette, sealing the victory for the Patriots.

<p>On July 31, 2015, the Seahawks and Wilson agreed to a 4-year, $87.6 million contract extension, making him, at the time, the second highest paid player in the NFL. In the season opener, he had a career-high 32 completions on 41 attempts for 251 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception in a 34â€“31 overtime loss to the St. Louis Rams. In the first nine games of the season, Wilson threw 10 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. Over the next five games, Wilson threw 19 touchdowns and no interceptions, becoming the only quarterback in NFL history to throw 3+ touchdown passes and no interceptions in five consecutive games. After a 2â€“4 start to the season, Wilson led the Seahawks to win seven of their next eight games and clinch a fourth consecutive playoff appearance in their Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns. In that stretch of games was a 39â€“30 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers where he was 21 of 30 for 345 yards and a career-high five passing touchdowns and no interceptions. and a 35â€“6 victory over the Baltimore Ravens where he was 23 of 32 for 292 yards and another five passing touchdown performance. His strong performance over the second half of the season, even after losing star running back Marshawn Lynch and tight end Jimmy Graham, led many analysts to consider Wilson an MVP candidate.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>Wilson broke numerous Seahawks single season passing records in 2015, including most passing yards (4,024), most passing touchdowns (34), and highest passer rating (110.1). He became the first Seahawks quarterback to throw for over 4,000 yards in a season, and finished the year with the highest passer rating in the NFL. Wilson's 51.7% deep ball completion percentage was the highest among NFL quarterbacks. On December 22, 2015, Wilson was named to his third Pro Bowl. He was ranked 17th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>The Seahawks traveled to Minnesota to face the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card Round. The temperature at kickoff was âˆ’6Â Â°F (âˆ’25Â Â°F wind chill), making it the third coldest game in NFL history. Wilson struggled in the sub-zero temperatures, throwing for 142 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. The Vikings missed a short field goal in the last minute, allowing the Seahawks to advance to the Divisional Round to face the 15â€“1 Carolina Panthers. Down 31â€“0 at the half, Wilson helped lead a furious comeback attempt, but the Panthers won 31â€“24, denying Wilson and the Seahawks their third consecutive in the NFC Championship and a shot at a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. In that game, Wilson threw for 366 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Wilson was drafted first overall by Team Irvin in the 2016 Pro Bowl draft, and in the game threw eight completions on 12 attempts for 164 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 149.3 rating. He was named the Pro Bowl offensive MVP.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2016:_Playing_injured">2016: Playing injured</span></h3>
<p>The Seahawks had a solid 2016 season with Wilson at the helm. However, Wilson drew two minor injuries: his ankle during Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins after getting stepped on by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh, and his left knee against the San Francisco 49ers during Week 3 after a takedown by linebacker Eli Harold. The injuries hampered Wilson's trademark mobility, and many speculated that he would be rested in order to properly recover.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Regardless, Wilson started all 16 games in the season. On November 20, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a 15-yard touchdown reception on a pass from Doug Baldwin on a trick play. The team finished with a 10â€“5â€“1 record and won the NFC West. Wilson put together a season where he recorded a career-high 4,219 passing yards, 21 passing touchdowns, 259 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown. The Seahawks made the playoffs, where they defeated the Detroit Lions in the Wild Card Round. The win gave Wilson his eighth playoff victory. However, they fell to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round at the Georgia Dome. He was ranked 24th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2017:_Missing_the_playoffs">2017: Missing the playoffs</span></h3>
<p>On September 5, 2017, Wilson was voted Seahawks offensive captain for the fifth consecutive season. In Week 3, in a 33â€“27 loss to the Tennessee Titans, he was 29 of 49 for 373 passing yards and four passing touchdowns. In Week 8 against the Houston Texans, Wilson posted an astounding performance, going 26 of 41 for a career-high 452 passing yards and four touchdowns in a matchup where both him and Deshaun Watson each threw over 400 yards. Wilson also rushed for 30 yards, totaling 482 yards of offense in the 41â€“38 victory. With his strong performance, Wilson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week. On December 21, 2017, the Seahawks were fined $100,000 for failure to properly apply the concussion protocol on a hit Wilson sustained during the Week 10 win over the Arizona Cardinals.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>In Week 12, with the win over San Francisco, Wilson became the winningest quarterback in a playerâ€™s first six seasons with 63 wins, surpassing Joe Flacco. Next week, with his 15-yard touchdown throw to running back J. D. McKissic, the third of his game, Wilson tied Eli Manning in 2011 for the most fourth quarter touchdowns in a single season with 15. He went 20 for 31 for 227 yards and three touchdowns in that game, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week. On December 19, 2017, Wilson was named to his fourth Pro Bowl.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>The Seahawks ended the season with nine wins, ending Wilson's streak of five consecutive seasons with double-digit wins and a playoff appearance. He threw for 34 touchdown passes, finishing the season as the league's leader in touchdowns thrown. With 586 rushing yards, he also finished the season as the team's leading rusher. Wilson was ranked 11th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2018:_Return_to_the_playoffs">2018: Return to the playoffs</span></h3>
<p>With the Seahawks having lost many Pro Bowl starters in the offseason such as Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, Kam Chancellor, Jimmy Graham and Richard Sherman, and having star safety Earl Thomas injured in beginning of the regular season, many considered the team a long shot to return to the playoffs. In addition to dealing with a re-tooled roster, Wilson also had a new offensive coordinator in Brian Schottenheimer, who replaced Darrell Bevell.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Wilson was once again named as a captain for the Seahawks going into the 2018 season. He started the season with 298 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 27â€“24 loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 1. In Week 3, against the Dallas Cowboys, he helped lead the Seahawks to their first victory of the season with 192 passing yards and two touchdowns. In Weeks 5â€“8, against the Los Angeles Rams, Oakland Raiders, and Detroit Lions, he had three consecutive games with three passing touchdowns. In Week 13, against the San Francisco 49ers, he had 185 passing yards and four touchdowns in the 43â€“16 victory.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>In Week 16, the Seahawks faced off against the top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs on <i>NBC Sunday Night Football</i>. Wilson out-dueled the season's eventual MVP Patrick Mahomes to lead the team to a 38â€“31 victory. This not only ensured another winning season for the Seahawks, but also defied early season expectations by returning to the post-season after a one-year absence. Wilson finished the season with 35 touchdowns and a 110.9 passer rating, both personal and franchise bests. He also set career franchise records with most quarterback regular season wins (75) and most touchdowns (196). As the #5-seed in the NFC, the Seahawks faced off against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round. Wilson passed for 233 yards and one passing touchdown to go along with a rushing touchdown as the Seahawks fell 24â€“22.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl for the fifth time in his career, replacing Aaron Rodgers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2019:_Highest_paid_player">2019: Highest paid player</span></h3>
<p>On April 16, 2019, Wilson signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension to remain with the Seahawks through the 2023 season, making him the highest paid player in the NFL.

<p>After graduating from high school, Wilson was selected by the Baltimore Orioles with the fifth pick in the 41st round (1,222nd overall) of the 2007 MLB draft. The Orioles considered Wilson a talent worthy of the first ten rounds, offered Wilson a $350,000 signing bonus, the third-largest they offered a draftee that year after Matt Wieters ($6Â million) and Jake Arrieta ($1.1Â million).
