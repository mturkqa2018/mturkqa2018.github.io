<p><i><b>The Mighty Hercules</b></i> is a Canadian/American low-budget animated series based loosely on the Greek mythological character of Heracles, under his Roman name Hercules. It was created in 1962 and then debuted on TV in 1963 and ran until 1966 coinciding with the sword and sandal genre of films popular at the time. Each stand-alone episode runs 5Â½ minutes, and in syndication were aired either as part of a block with other cartoons, or several episodes together to fill 30-minute time slots.

<p>The cartoon features Hercules, the legendary hero, who dwells on Mount Olympus. Villains threaten the people of ancient Greece, often in the kingdom of Calydon, and Hercules comes to the rescue. When in serious danger, he puts on his magic ring from which he gets his superpowers. Once wearing the ring and raising his fist, the ring is struck by flashes of lightning (referred to as the Thunder of Zeus in several episodes), and Hercules is then endowed with super-strength. He does battle with nemeses such as Daedalus, an evil wizard who is the chief villain (sometimes accompanied by his pet cat Dydo). Other villains include Wilhemine the Sea Witch (accompanied by her pet bird Elvira) and Murtis, who was invulnerable due to wearing an iron helmet known as the Mask of Vulcan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Hercules's friends and allies are:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<ul><li>his main sidekick Newton, the helpful boy centaur who has a habit of repeating himself every time he speaks</li>
<li>Helena, Hercules' girlfriend</li>
<li>Prince (later King) Dorian of Calydon</li>
<li>Tewt, a small satyr who vocalizes only by playing his syrinx</li>
<li>Timon, a young human from Calydon</li>
<li>Pegasus, Hercules' winged steed.</li></ul>
<p>Also featured atop Mount Olympus are Hercules's father Zeus and Dodonis with his crystal rock of seeing.  Both often warn Hercules of the troubles going on down below in and around the Kingdom of Calydon or deep in the Lernaean Forest.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The original episode has relatively lavish animation by John Gentilella. In it, Hercules beats his friend Theseus in a foot race and a wrestling match, and for his victory is granted any request by Zeus as a reward. Hercules wishes to go to Earth to fight evil and injustice, but Zeus reminds him that going to Earth would cause him to lose his godly powers and become a mortal. Zeus then creates a magic ring that allows Hercules access to his godly strength while on Earth. The rest of the cartoon involves Hercules meeting Helena and fighting a giant named Cacus and the giant's pet dragon. None of the other familiar characters make an appearance in this episode, and it features different character designs for Hercules and Helena.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The show generally used real Greek myths for their inspiration, but used the influences oddly. Daedalus is the evil wizard who is Hercules's most frequent foe, but Daedalus was a mythological artificer who wasn't a villain at all. Cacus is the giant in the first episode, based on the mythological monster Cacus. Other recurring creatures were taken directly from Hercules's Twelve Labors, such as the Nemean Lion, the Lernaean Hydra, the Erymanthian Boar, and the Stymphalian Birds; but most weren't presented as trials for him to overcome.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In addition to the ring, later episodes added new equipment for Hercules and his friends to use, such as a "moon stone" beam in his belt, and an invulnerable sword and shield. Episodes invariably ended with Hercules racing towards Mount Olympus and shouting "Olympia!" after defeating the villain.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>128 episodes of approximately 5 minutes each were produced. Adventure Cartoon Productions made the series in connection with Trans-Lux Television, the same people who later brought the anime series <i>Speed Racer</i> to U.S. audiences. Joe Oriolo was producer-director, and many of the animators were veterans of the New York animation scene, including Grim Natwick, Frank Endres, John Gentilella, George Germanetti, Reuben Grossman, and George Rufle.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The theme music is credited to Winston Sharples (as Win Sharples) who spent more than two decades at Paramount Pictures composing background music for the <i>Superman</i> and <i>Popeye</i> theatrical cartoons produced by the Fleischer brothers. However, the transformative "ring anthem" frequently used as Hercules slips on the ring given him by Zeus, along with several bridges of music used throughout episodes, are taken from the 1954 film <i>The Black Shield of Falworth</i>, the music credited to Joseph Gershenson but really composed by Hans Salter, Herman Stein and Frank Skinner, the long time in-house film composer for Universal Studios.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The show also featured two different sets of voices for the characters. In early episodes of the first season, Hercules' voice was done by voice actor David Hartman who went on to host the TV show Good Morning America.  There was no gradual change - most of the early episodes had one set of voices, the rest have the second set. The most noticeably different voice was Newton: his original voice sounds as if he has just hit puberty, with his voice constantly cracking, while the later episodes give him a high-pitched Mickey Mouse-like voice. The animation for the "putting on and charging up the ring" sequence also subtly changed with the voices. For an example of the former style and voices, see the episodes "The Minotaur" or "The Chair of Forgetfulness"; for an example of the latter, see "The Nemean Lion" or "The Chameleon Creature".  In "Double Trouble", the voices actually change right near the end of the episode, with Newton speaking a line in his original cracking voice, and the very next line in his second high-pitched voice.  Hercules's final two lines of the short are likewise in his second voice.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Although there are two voices, Hercules's voice actor is always credited as Jimmy Tapp. Daedalus' voice actor, depending on the episode, is Jack Mercer or Gerry Bascombe. Early episodes feature Jack Mercer voicing Newton and other incidental characters. The series also features a theme song sung by singer Johnny Nash, the American reggae singer-songwriter best known for 1956's "A Very Special Love" and 1972's "I Can See Clearly Now".  The theme's lyrics were written by Winston Sharples's son Winston Sharples, Jr. under the pseudonym "Win Singleton" (his first and middle names). The voice actress for all the female voices is Helene Nickerson. The theme song was covered in 2009 by Canadian jazz musician John Stetch on his album <i>TV Trio</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 2005, the series was re-issued to television in a newly remastered version and was reformatted, and in the process, replacing the familiar theme music with new title music by an unknown singer. The version airing as of 2015 on the Canadian network Teletoon Retro, however, uses the original Nash theme music.
