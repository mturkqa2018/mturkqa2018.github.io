<ul><li>The first known case of HIV in a human occurs in a man who died in the Congo, later (from his preserved blood samples) confirmed as having HIV infection.</li>
<li>June 28, in New York City, Ardouin Antonio, a 49-year-old Haitian shipping clerk dies of <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia, a disease closely associated with AIDS. Gordon Hennigar, who performed the postmortem examination of the man's body, found "the first reported instance of unassociated <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> disease in an adult" to be so unusual that he preserved Ardouin's lungs for later study. The case was published in two medical journals at the time, and Hennigar has been quoted in numerous publications saying that he believes Ardouin probably had AIDS.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1960s</dt></dl>
<ul><li>HIV-2, a viral variant found in West Africa, is thought to have transferred to people from sooty mangabey monkeys in Guinea-Bissau.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1964</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Jerome Horwitz of Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University School of Medicine synthesize AZT under a grant from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). AZT was originally intended as an anticancer drug.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1966</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Genetic studies of the virus indicate that, in or about 1966, HIV first arrived in the Americas, infecting one person in Haiti. At this time, many Haitians were working in Congo, providing the opportunity for infection.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1968</dt></dl>
<ul><li>A 2003 analysis of HIV types found in the United States, compared to known mutation rates, suggests that the virus may have first arrived in the United States in this year. The disease spread from the 1966 American strain, but remained unrecognized for another 12 years. This is, however, contradicted by the estimated area of time of initial infection of Robert Rayford who was most likely infected around 1959.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1969</dt></dl>
<ul><li>A St. Louis teenager, identified as Robert Rayford, dies of an illness that baffles his doctors. Eighteen years later, molecular biologists at Tulane University in New Orleans test samples of his remains and find evidence of HIV.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1976</dt></dl>
<ul><li>The 9-year-old daughter of Arvid Noe dies in January. Noe, a Norwegian sailor, dies in April; his wife dies in December. Later it is determined that Noe contracted HIV/AIDS in Africa during the early 1960s.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1977</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Danish physician Grethe Rask dies of AIDS contracted in Africa.</li>
<li>A San Francisco woman, believed to be a sex-worker, gives birth to the first of three children who were later diagnosed with AIDS. The children's blood was tested after their deaths and revealed an HIV infection. The mother died of AIDS in May 1987. Test results show she was infected no later than 1977.</li>
<li>French-Canadian flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas gets legally married in Los Angeles in order to get citizenship. He stays in Silver Lake, a section of Los Angeles, whenever he is in town.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1978</dt></dl>
<ul><li>A Portuguese man known as <i>Senhor</i> José (English: Mr. Joseph) dies; he will later be confirmed as the first known infection of HIV-2. It is believed that he was exposed to the disease in Guinea-Bissau in 1966.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1979</dt></dl>
<ul><li>An early case of AIDS in the United States was of a female baby born in New Jersey in 1973 or 1974. She was born to a sixteen-year-old girl, an identified drug-injector, who had previously had multiple male sexual partners. The baby died in 1979 at the age of five. Subsequent testing on her stored tissues confirmed that she had contracted HIV-1.</li>
<li>A thirty-year-old woman from the Dominican Republic dies at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City from CMV infection.</li></ul>

<ul><li>May 18, Lawrence Mass becomes the first journalist in the world to write about the epidemic, in the <i>New York Native</i>, a gay newspaper. A gay tipster overheard his physician mention that some gay men were being treated in intensive-care units in New York City for a strange pneumonia. "Disease Rumors Largely Unfounded" was the headline of Mass's article. Mass repeated a New York City public-health official's claims that there was no wave of disease sweeping through the gay community. At this point, however, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had been gathering information for about a month on the outbreak that Mass's source dismissed.</li>
<li>June 5, The CDC reports a cluster of <i>Pneumocystis</i> pneumonia in five gay men in Los Angeles.</li>

<li>December 12, First known case reported in the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>One of the first reported patients to have died of AIDS (presumptive diagnosis) in the US is reported in the journal <i>Gastroentereology</i>. Louis Weinstein, the treating physician, wrote that "Immunologic incompetence, related to either disease or therapy, or both ... although suspected, could not be proved..."</li>
<li>By the end of the year, 121 people are known to have died from the disease.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1982</dt></dl>
<ul><li>January, the service organization Gay Men's Health Crisis is founded by Larry Kramer and others in New York City.</li>
<li>April 12, Golden Globe-nominated film actor Lenny Baker succumbs to AIDS-related cancer at the age of 37. Baker had been gravely ill and in the final stage of the disease since 1980.</li>
<li>June 18, "Exposure to some substance (rather than an infectious agent) may eventually lead to immunodeficiency among a subset of the homosexual male population that shares a particular style of life." For example, Marmor <i>et al.</i> recently reported that exposure to amyl nitrite was associated with an increased risk of KS in New York City. Exposure to inhalant sexual stimulants, central-nervous-system stimulants, and a variety of other "street" drugs was common among males belonging to the cluster of cases of KS and PCP in Los Angeles and Orange counties."</li>
<li>July 4, Terry Higgins becomes one of the first people to die of AIDS-related illnesses in the United Kingdom, prompting the foundation in November of what was to become the Terrence Higgins Trust.</li>

<li>July 27, The term AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is proposed at a meeting in Washington of gay-community leaders, federal bureaucrats and the CDC to replace GRID (gay-related immune deficiency) as evidence showed it was not gay specific.</li>
<li>Summer, First known case in Italy.</li>
<li>September 24, The CDC defines a case of AIDS as a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease. Such diseases include KS, PCP, and serious OI. Diagnoses are considered to fit the case definition only if based on sufficiently reliable methods (generally histology or culture). Some patients who are considered AIDS cases on the basis of diseases only moderately predictive of cellular immunodeficiency may not actually be immunodeficient and may not be part of the current epidemic.</li>
<li>December 10, a baby in California becomes ill in the first known case of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.</li>
<li>First known case in Brazil.</li>
<li>First known case in Canada.</li>
<li>First known case in Australia, diagnosed at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1983</dt></dl>
<ul><li>January, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, isolates a retrovirus that kills T-cells from the lymph system of a gay AIDS patient.

<li>First known case in Portugal.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1984</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Around January, the first case of HIV infection in the Philippines was reported.</li>
<li>Gaëtan Dugas passes away due to AIDS-related illnesses. He was a French-Canadian flight attendant who was falsely identified as patient 0 due to his central location and labelling as "patient O," as in the letter O, in a scientific study of 40 infected Americans from multiple U.S. cities.</li>
<li>Roy Cohn is diagnosed with AIDS, but attempts to keep his condition secret while receiving experimental drug treatment.</li>
<li>April 23, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler announces at a press conference that an American scientist, Robert Gallo, has discovered the <i>probable cause</i> of AIDS: the retrovirus is subsequently named <i>human immunodeficiency virus</i> or HIV in 1986.

White became infected with HIV from a blood products that were administered to him on a regular basis as part of his treatment for hemophilia. When the public school that he attended, Western Middle School in Russiaville, Indiana, learned of his disease in 1985 there was enormous pressure from parents and faculty to bar him from school premises. Due to the widespread fear of AIDS and lack of medical knowledge, principal Ron Colby and the school board assented. His family filed a lawsuit, seeking to overturn the ban.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>1985</dt></dl>
<ul><li>March 2, the FDA approves an ELISA test as the first commercially available test for detecting HIV in blood.

<ul><li>New, aggressive strain of HIV discovered in Cuba Researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium say the HIV strain CRF19 can progress to AIDS within two to three years of exposure to virus. Typically, HIV takes approximately 10 years to develop into AIDS. The researchers found that patients with the CRF19 variant had more virus in their blood than patients who had more common strains.  Patients with CRF19 may start getting sick before they even know they've been infected, which ultimately means there's a significantly shorter time span to stop the disease's progression. The researchers suspect that fragments of other subsets of the virus fasten to each other through an enzyme which makes the virus more powerful and more easily replicated in the body, thus the faster progression.</li>
