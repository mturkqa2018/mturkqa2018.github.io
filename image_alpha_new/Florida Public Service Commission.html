<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</span></h2>
<p>The Florida Legislature established the powers and responsibilities of the Florida Public Service Commission as a regulator of public utilities under its jurisdiction.  The Commission is committed to making sure that Florida's consumers receive some of their most essential servicesâ€”electric, natural gas, telephone, water, and wastewaterâ€”in a safe, reasonable, and reliable manner.  In doing so, the PSC exercises regulatory authority over utilities in one or more of three key areas: rate base/economic regulation; competitive market oversight; and monitoring of safety, reliability, and service issues.  Those areas are briefly described as follows:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p>
<dl><dd>Rate base/economic regulation involves analyzing requested rate changes and conducting earnings surveillance to ensure that regulated utilities are not exceeding their authorized rates of return;</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Competitive market oversight entails facilitating the development of competitive markets and issues associated with them; and</dd></dl>

<p>The FPSC oversees the administration of a statewide telecommunications access system to provide access to Telecommunications Relay Services by persons who are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired, or others who communicate with them.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>In early 2014, AT&amp;T notified the Commission that it was opting out of its contract options, so the FPSC issued a Request for Proposals for a new Relay Service Provider. Based on a competitive bid evaluation process, the Commission awarded a three-year contract with Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (Sprint) to provide telecommunications relay service to the nearly three million hard-of-hearing, deaf, deaf/blind, and speech impaired Floridians. Service begins June 1, 2015. Of the two companies bidding, Sprint received the highest technical rating and offered the lowest overall per-minute cost for service. Sprint was the only bidder proposing to hire an in-state Customer Relations Manager. Sprint also proposed to designate a Florida Relay Quality Manager.
