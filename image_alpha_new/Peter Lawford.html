<p><b>Peter Sydney Ernest Lawford</b> (born <b>Peter Sydney Ernest Aylen</b>; 7 September 1923 – 24 December 1984) was an English actor, producer, and socialite, who lived in the United States throughout his adult life.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>He was a member of the "Rat Pack" and the brother-in-law of President John F. Kennedy and senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward Kennedy. From the 1940s to the 1960s, he was a well-known celebrity and starred in a number of highly acclaimed films. In later years, he was noted more for his off-screen activities as a celebrity than for his acting; it was said that he was "famous for being famous".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Born in London in 1923, he was the only child of Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford, KBE (1865–1953) and May Sommerville Bunny (1883–1972). At the time of Peter's birth, however, his mother was married to Lieutenant colonel Dr Ernest Vaughn Aylen D.S.O, one of Sir Sydney's officers, while his father was married to Muriel Williams. At the time, May and Ernest Aylen were living apart. May confessed to Aylen that the child was not his, a revelation that resulted in a double divorce. Sydney and May wed in September 1924 after their divorces were finalised and when their son was one year old.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Lawford's family was connected to the English aristocracy through his uncle Ernest Lawford's wife (a daughter of the 14th Earl of Eglinton) as well as his aunt Ethel Turner Lawford (who married a son of the 1st Baron Avebury). His aunt, Jessie Bruce Lawford, another of his father's sisters, was the second wife of the Hon Hartley Williams, senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court of the colony of Victoria, Australia. A relative, through his mother, was Australian artist Rupert Bunny.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_childhood">Early childhood</span></h3>
<p>He spent his early childhood in France and, owing to his family's travels, was never formally educated. Instead, he was schooled by governesses and tutors, and his education included tennis and ballet lessons.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>"In the beginning," his mother observed, "he had no homework. When he was older he had Spanish, German and music added to his studies. He read only selected books: English fairy stories, English and French classics; no crime stories. Having studied Peter for so long, I decided he was quite unfitted for any career except art, so I cut Latin, Algebra, high mathematics and substituted dramatics instead."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Because of the widely varying national and religious backgrounds of his tutors, Lawford "attended various services in churches, cathedrals, synagogues and for some time was an usher in a Christian Science Sunday School...."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Around 1930, aged seven, he made his acting debut in the English film <i>Poor Old Bill</i>. He also had an uncredited bit in <i>A Gentleman of Paris</i> (1931).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accident">Accident</span></h3>
<p>At the age of 14, Lawford severely injured his right arm in an accident when it went through a glass door. The injury greatly compromised the use of his lower arm and hand with irreversible nerve damage, which he later learned to hide. The injury was judged to be serious enough to prevent his entrance into the armed forces, which his parents had planned. Instead, Lawford decided to pursue a career as an actor, a decision that resulted in one of his aunts refusing to leave him her considerable fortune, as originally planned.

<p>In 1938, Lawford was travelling through Hollywood when spotted by a talent scout. He was screen tested and made his Hollywood debut in a minor part in the film <i>Lord Jeff</i> starring Freddie Bartholomew.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The outbreak of World War II found the Lawfords in Florida. In a matter of days, they realized that they had been stranded. Their money was in Britain and Britain was at war. Their assets were frozen. Peter, then 16, took a job parking cars. When he saved enough money for the fare, he went back to Hollywood where he supported himself working as a theater usher until he began to get film work.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Extra_work_and_bit_parts">Extra work and bit parts</span></h3>
<p>The advent of World War II saw an increase in British war stories and Lawford found himself in demand playing military personnel, albeit usually in uncredited parts. He could be glimpsed in <i>Mrs. Miniver</i> (1942) and <i>Eagle Squadron</i> (1942), both times as pilots.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>His decent role in a major film production was in <i>A Yank at Eton</i> (1942), starring Mickey Rooney, in which Lawford played a snobbish bully. It was very popular at the box office.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Lawford was a cadet in <i>Thunder Birds: Soldiers of the Air</i> (1942) and <i>Junior Army</i> (1942) (starring Bartholomew), a soldier in <i>Random Harvest</i> (1942), <i>Immortal Sergeant</i> (1942), and <i>London Blackout Murders</i> (1943) (directed by George Sherman), and a navigator in <i>Assignment in Brittany</i> (1943). He had a billed part in <i>The Purple V</i> (1943).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>At MGM he was a student in <i>Above Suspicion</i> (1943), a soldier in <i>Pilot #5</i> (1943), a naval commander in <i>The Sky's the Limit</i> (1943) (with Fred Astaire), and an Australian in <i>The Man from Down Under</i> (1943). He had a minor role at Republic's <i>Someone to Remember</i> (1943) and <i>The West Side Kid</i> (1943), the latter directed by Sherman.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Lawford played a soldier in <i>Sahara</i> (1943) and sailors in <i>Sherlock Holmes Faces Death</i> (1943) and <i>Corvette K-225</i> (1943). He was a Frenchman in <i>Paris After Dark</i> (1943) and <i>Flesh and Fantasy</i> (1943), and was a student in MGM's <i>Girl Crazy</i> (1943) and <i>The Adventures of Mark Twain</i> (1944).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="MGM">MGM</span></h3>
<p>Lawford's career stepped up a notch when signed to a long term contract to MGM in June 1943. The studio signed him with a specific role in mind - <i>The White Cliffs of Dover</i> (1944), in which he played a young soldier during the Second World War. The film was very popular.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Lawford had a small role in <i>The Canterville Ghost</i> (1944) and <i>Mrs. Parkington</i> (1944), playing a suitor of Greer Garson.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>MGM gave him another important role in <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1945).

<p>Lawford's first leading role came in <i>Son of Lassie</i> (1945), a big hit.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Lawford was put in a Kathryn Grayson-June Allyson musical, <i>Two Sisters from Boston </i> (1946) which was very popular. Ernst Lubitsch used him at Fox in <i>Cluny Brown</i> (1946) where he was billed after Charles Boyer and Jennifer Jones.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>He won a <i>Modern Screen</i> magazine readers' poll as the most popular actor in Hollywood of 1946. His fan mail jumped to thousands of letters a week. With actors such as Clark Gable and James Stewart away at war, Lawford was recognised as a new romantic lead on the MGM lot.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Lawford made <i>My Brother Talks to Horses</i> (1947) with Jackie Butch Jenkins, an early work of Fred Zinnemann which was a big flop. He and was reunited with Grayson in <i>It Happened in Brooklyn </i> (1947), which also starred Frank Sinatra. Lawford received rave reviews for his work in the film, while Sinatra's were lukewarm.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>Lawford later admitted that the most terrifying experience of his career was the first musical number he performed in the musical <i>Good News</i> (1947), the film he starred in alongside Allyson. Using an American accent for his role, he won acclaim as a performer.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>He was Esther Williams' leading man in <i>On an Island with You</i> (1948) and supported Fred Astaire and Judy Garland in <i>Easter Parade</i> (1948), a huge hit, and Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in <i>Julia Misbehaves</i> (1948), also popular.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>He played Laurie in MGM's version of <i>Little Women</i> (1949) alongside Allyson and Elizabeth Taylor. He was billed beneath Pidgeon and Ethel Barrymore in the anti Communist <i>The Red Danube</i> (1949) and was one of Deborah Kerr's leading men in <i>Please Believe Me</i> (1951).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>He was Jane Powell's love interest in <i>Royal Wedding</i> (1951) with Fred Astaire and co starred with Janet Leigh in <i>Just This Once</i> (1952), both popular.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>20th Century Fox borrowed him for <i>Kangaroo</i> (1952), a melodrama shot in Australia with Maureen O'Hara.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Back at MGM he was top billed in some lower budgeted films: <i>You for Me</i> (1953), a comedy, <i>The Hour of 13</i> (1953), a thriller and <i>Rogue's March</i> (1953), a war film. The studio then let him go.

<p>In 1959, Sinatra invited Lawford to join the "Rat Pack" and also got him a role in <i>Never So Few</i> (1959).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>Peter Lawford and Sinatra appeared in <i>Oceans 11</i> (1961). Lawford had been first told of the basic story of the film by director Gilbert Kay, who heard the idea from a gas station attendant. Lawford eventually bought the rights in 1958, imagining William Holden in the lead. Sinatra became interested in the idea, and a variety of writers worked on the project.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Lawford played a British soldier in the acclaimed Israeli-set drama <i>Exodus</i> (1960) for Otto Preminger and had a cameo in <i>Pepe</i> (1960). In 1960, he became an American citizen and assisted on his brother-in-law's successful presidential election.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>He did a TV remake of <i>The Farmer's Daughter</i> (1962) with Lee Remick and was reunited with the Rat Pack in <i>Sergeants 3</i> (1962).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Lawford played a Senator in <i>Advise &amp; Consent</i> (1962) for Preminger and was Lord Lovat in  <i>The Longest Day</i> (1962), a war film with a star-studded cast.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Producer">Producer</span></h3>
<p>In 1961, Lawford and his manager Milt Ebbins formed <i>Chrislaw Productions</i>, which was named after Peter's son Christopher. It signed a three year deal with United Artists to make three features and two TV series for $10 million. William Asher was to be executive producer. Their first project was to be a remake of the old silent film <i>The Great Train Robbery</i>. That film was not made; however they did produce the 1963 action film <i>Johnny Cool</i> starring Henry Silva and Elizabeth Montgomery.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Lawford was Bette Davis' leading man in <i>Dead Ringer</i> (1964) and guest starred on <i>The Alfred Hitchcock Hour</i>, <i>Profiles in Courage</i> (as General Alexander William Doniphan), <i>Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre</i> and <i>Run for Your Life</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>He went on to produce the Patty Duke film <i>Billie</i> (1965) and had support roles in two Carroll Baker movies, playing her fiance both times: <i>Sylvia</i> (1965) and <i>Harlow</i> (1965).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>By now Lawford had fallen out with Sinatra - who replaced him in <i>Robin and the 7 Hoods</i> (1964) with Bing Crosby -but Davis remained loyal and got Lawford a support role in <i>A Man Called Adam</i> (1966). He and Patrica Kennedy divorced in 1966.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p><p>He guest starred on shows like <i>The Wild Wild West</i>, <i>I Spy</i> and was in <i>How I Spent My Summer Vacation</i> (1967).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Lawford went to Europe to star in <i>Dead Run</i> (1967) and <i>The Fourth Wall</i> (1968). He was a popular guest star on TV comedy and game shows.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>He produced a film starring himself and Davis,<i>Salt and Pepper</i> (1968) and had support roles in <i>Skidoo</i> (1968) for Preminger, <i>Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell</i> (1968), <i>Hook, Line and Sinker</i> (1969) with Jerry Lewis, and <i>The April Fools</i> (1969).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p><i>Salt and Pepper</i> was popular enough for Lawford to raise money for a sequel, <i>One More Time</i> (1970) directed by Lewis. He supported George Hamilton in <i>Togetherness</i> (1970) and guest starred several times on <i>Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In</i>. In 1971 he would marry Rowan's daughter Mary.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>He returned to MGM for <i>They Only Kill Their Masters</i> (1972), which reunited him with several former MGM contract players.

Kennedy aboard the yacht "Manitou", a former USCG training vessel that was used as a "floating White House', off the coast of Johns Island, Maine, August 12, 1962</div></div></div>
<p>His first marriage, in 1954, was to socialite Pat Kennedy, a younger sister of then-US Senator John F. Kennedy (D-MA). They had four children: a son, actor and author Christopher Lawford (1955−2018), and daughters Sydney Maleia Lawford (b. 1956), Victoria Francis Lawford (b. 1958), and Robin Elizabeth Lawford (b. 1961).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>Lawford, born in London, became an American citizen on 23 April 1960. He had prepared for this in time to vote for his brother-in-law in the upcoming presidential election. Lawford, along with other members of the "Rat Pack", helped campaign for Kennedy and the Democratic Party. Sinatra famously dubbed him "Brother-in-Lawford" at this time. Lawford and Patricia Kennedy divorced in February 1966.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>Lawford was originally cast as Alan A. Dale in the film <i>Robin and the 7 Hoods</i> but was replaced by Bing Crosby following a break in Sinatra's relationship with Lawford. The break stemmed from a scheduled visit to Sinatra's home by Lawford's brother-in-law, President Kennedy, during a 1962 West Coast trip. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was long concerned about Sinatra's rumoured ties with underworld figures, encouraged the President to change his plans and stay at Crosby's home, which (it was maintained) could provide better security for the President. The change came at the last minute, after Sinatra had made extensive arrangements for the promised and eagerly awaited presidential visit, including the construction of a helipad. Sinatra was furious, believing that Lawford had failed to intercede with the Kennedys on his behalf, and banished him from the Rat Pack.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>Sinatra and Lawford's friendship was over. They only spoke when Sinatra called after his son Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped on 8 December 1963, and he needed the help of Lawford's brother-in-law Robert Kennedy, then Attorney General. With the exception of Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey's 1968 presidential race, Sinatra never endorsed another Democratic candidate. Crosby, a staunch Republican, ended up cast in Lawford's role.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>Lawford married his second wife, Mary Rowan, daughter of comedian Dan Rowan, in October 1971. Rowan and Lawford separated two years later and divorced in January 1975. In June 1976 he married aspiring actress Deborah Gould, whom he had known for three weeks. Lawford and Gould separated two months after marrying and divorced in 1977. Following the divorce, Lawford moved into the Sierra Towers where he lived for the next few years on the thirtieth floor. During his separation from Gould, Lawford met Patricia Seaton who became his fourth and final wife in July 1984, just months before his death.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Death">Death</span></h2>
<p>Lawford died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve 1984, aged 61, from cardiac arrest. He had suffered from kidney and liver failure after years of substance abuse. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery. Owing to a dispute between his widow and the cemetery, Lawford's ashes were removed from the cemetery in 1988 and scattered into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California by his widow Patricia Seaton Lawford, who invited the <i>National Enquirer</i> tabloid to photograph the event.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>For his contribution to the television industry, Peter Lawford has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6920 Hollywood Blvd.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>A plaque bearing Lawford's name was erected at Westwood Village Memorial Park.
