<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>As the national Co-director of Interreligious Affairs for the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago, Eckstein, an Orthodox rabbi, began to forge partnerships with evangelical Christians. In 1983, he established the Holyland Fellowship of Christians and Jews to promote Jewish-Christian cooperation on projects for improving the safety and security of Jews in Israel and around the world.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>In 1988, "Ask the Rabbi," The Fellowship's nationally syndicated radio program, began airing on predominantly Christian stations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In 1991, the organization was renamed the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In 1992, the first group of Russian Jews is airlifted to Israel by the On Wings of Eagles program, which has since brought hundreds of thousands of Jews to Israel from the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia, Argentina and other distressed countries.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The Fellowship collects over $100 million a year in donations for Israel, half of which are spent in Israel itself, supporting soup kitchens, absorption centers, and bomb shelter renovations. $25 million a year is spent on Jewish aid programs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 2003, Eckstein founded the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews of Canada; in 2006, <i>La Fraternidad Internacional de Cristianos y JudÃ­os</i>; in 2012, the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews of Australia; and, also in 2012, a new Fellowship affiliate in South Korea.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In 2014, Eckstein was awarded the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committeeâ€™s prestigious Raoul Wallenberg Award. "Rabbi Eckstein and IFCJ have done so much to help so many of the worldâ€™s most vulnerable Jews and we are proud of all that we have done together to reach so many in need," JDC CEO Alan Gill said at the ceremony, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>James Rudin, a senior inter-religious adviser for the American Jewish Community, described Eckstein as "well-respected within the American Jewish mainstream. Until he came along, evangelicals and Jews were like ships passing in the night."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Eckstein died on February 6, 2019. His daughter, Yael Eckstein, succeeded him as president of the Fellowship.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organizational_structure">Organizational structure</span></h2>
<p>The organization has headquarters in Chicago and Jerusalem. It is supervised by an independent board of directors, Jewish and Christian. In May 2010, Israelâ€™s Minister of Welfare and Social Services Isaac Herzog presented Eckstein with the government of Israel's first-ever Award for Special Contribution to the Welfare of the People of Israel. The following month, <i>Newsweek</i> named him one of the 50 Most Influential Rabbis in America. Eckstein has received about 50 awards total for his public service work, including the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committeeâ€™s prestigious Raoul Wallenberg award in 2014.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 2005, Eckstein was appointed Goodwill Ambassador of the State of Israel, with special emphasis on Israelâ€™s relationships with evangelical communities in Latin America.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rating_and_salaries">Rating and salaries</span></h3>
<p>Charity Navigator gave the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews a three-star rating (score 85.68 of 100) in 2018.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Activities">Activities</span></h2>
<p>The Fellowship's outreach focuses on five major programs:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<ul><li><b>On Wings of Eagles</b> assists Jews in making <i>aliyah</i> (immigration) to Israel from the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia, Europe, Arab lands, and other countries around the world, and helps them with their <i>klitah</i> (resettlement).</li>
<li><b>Guardians of Israel</b> provides basic necessities to needy Israelis by supporting hundreds of projects such as soup kitchens, and by providing food, clothing and basic medical assistance to be distributed while addressing long-term needs like housing, family care, and jobs.</li>
<li><b>Isaiah 58</b> provides food packages, hot â€œmeals-on-wheels,â€ medicine, in-home care, housing, heating fuel, clothing, and other basic essentials to more than 200,000 destitute elderly Soviet Jews, and gives Jewish orphans and vulnerable street children in the former Soviet Union the care they need to survive and prepare for a brighter future.</li>
<li><b>Stand for Israel</b> rallies churches, Christian leaders and others to advocate for Israel by praying for her and supporting her right to exist in peace and security. The Fellowship aims to â€œengage people both spiritually and politically on behalf of Israel and the Jewish people, by encouraging them to "pray for the peace of Jerusalem" and providing them with the facts they need to advocate for the Jewish state and fight anti-Israel bias in the media.â€</li>
<li><b>4Zion</b> is a pro-Israel initiative geared toward students and a younger generation of Israel supporters.</li></ul>
<p>The organization also supports the <i>Israeli Christian Recruitment Forum</i>, a group led by Gabriel Naddaf, a Greek Orthodox priest from Nazareth, which aims to increase the number of Christian Arabs volunteering to serve in the Israel Defense Forces.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Finances">Finances</span></h2>
<p>The Fellowship is recognized as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization by the IRS. It submits to examination by the Better Business Bureauâ€™s Wise Giving Alliance. In 2004, The Fellowship was one of the first not-for-profits entitled to display the BBB Charity Seal, showing full compliance with their Standards for Charitable Accountability.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In 2015, according to their tax returns the ministry declared $132 million in "contributions and grants" up from $129 million in the previous year and $113 million in 2012. In the same year it was reported that founder and current president Yechiel Eckstein earned $909,636 in salary, with a base compensation of $670,439 and other benefits being $239,197. According to independent American charity watchdog Charity Navigator, 76% of expenses went towards programs and services it delivers, 10.5% on  Administrative Expenses and 13.4% on Fundraising Expenses.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>In 2009, six months before his death, the Lithuanian-Haredi Ultra-Orthodox Jewish leader Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv  issued a ruling banning Haredi Jews from taking funds from the Fellowship, citing worries of Christian missionary activity and idol worship. In response to the ruling, Eckstein said he would "expose his organization's list of Haredi-religious beneficiaries in order "to make sure everything is transparent."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The Fellowship's interfaith work has generated criticism from some in the Jewish community. In 2001, Rabbi Avraham Shapira, a rabbi of Zionism and Orthodox Judaism, issued a ruling against accepting funds from the Fellowship. In 2002 the Edah HaChareidis Ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbinical court issued a ruling against accepting funds from the Fellowship, and, in 2007, the new Chief Rabbi of the said Edah HaChareidis, Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss added his signature.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In 2014, many Religious Zionist rabbis reiterated their position that it is forbidden to take money from the IFCJ. Religious Zionist rabbis claim the enrollment of many Israeli children in summer camps problematic, as the Israeli Ministry of Education utilizes IFCJ money to partially funds their camps.
