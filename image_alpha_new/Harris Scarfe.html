<p><b>Harris Scarfe</b> is an Australian department store that was established in Adelaide, South Australia in 1849. The store sells primarily kitchenware, manchester, electrical goods, and apparel, and it is owned by South African retail group Pepkor. As of September 2015, there were 54 Harris Scarfe stores in two formats: "Harris Scarfe" department stores and "HS Home" or "Harris Scarfe Home" homewares stores.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Harris Scarfe has expanded through organic growth, new store openings, mergers, and acquisitions. The current store network reflects this mix, in particular, the purchase or merging of regional or state based retail groups including Allens in New South Wales and FitzGerald's in Tasmania. The group is now owned by Pepkor, but has at times been subject to different ownership structures and a period of being in receivership.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The Rundle Place store on Rundle Mall, Adelaide has remained the business' main store and showcases a contemporary "look and feel" across two floors. Regional and suburban store layout varies significantly.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Adelaide has been the location of a number of locally owned department stores and discount stores including John Martins, Peoplestores, Miller Anderson &amp; Co., Cravens, Cox Foys, (which Harris Scarfe acquired and closed in 1977), Charles Birks (acquired by David Jones in 1954), Malcolm Reid, and Charles Moore and Co.. Harris Scarfe is the only remaining store group.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<dl><dt>1800s</dt></dl>
<p>Harris Scarfe traces its history to 10 February 1849, when the founding partners, George Peter Harris and John C. Lanyon, arrived in Adelaide South Australia on the ship, "Candahar", to establish a hardware and ironmongery business. One of their first known advertisements in the local Adelaide paper was on 11 April 1850.  Lanyon left the partnership on 22 February 1855 and returned to London, where he subsequently opened up a buying house for Geo. P Harris and other businesses in South Australia. This firm acted as the London house for many years. Additional partners, George Scarfe and Richard Smith, joined the business in 1866 on a handshake, and the business name "Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe &amp; Co." was adopted in December that year.  
The deeds were drawn up on 10 July 1871.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Harris Scarfe grew to become a major supplier of a broad range of household, agricultural and industrial items. Geo. P Harris returned to England in 1873 where he died on 26 November that year, aged 52. George Scarfe continued on as chairman of the business until he died on 14 April 1903, aged 76.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Besides conducting its retailing business from its Adelaide premises, Harris Scarfe manufactured leather goods, including saddlery and luggage.
It also had a wholesaling operation, with a team of commercial travellers who visited country regions throughout South Australia. This business was supported with a promotional product catalogue, which became well known in country areas. During World War II, when the Australian Government enforced price controls, it used the Harris Scarfe catalogue as the price guide.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>After World War II, Harris Scarfe's prosperity grew with South Australia, as it supplied building materials during the postwar building boom.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<dl><dt>1970s</dt></dl>
<p>In 1971, Baradeen Quest Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Investment and Merchant Finance Corporation Limited ("IMFC") made a successful takeover bid for Harris Scarfe Limited, which at the time was a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The Rundle Street (now Rundle Mall) store continued trading, with expansion of its frontage to establish a new womenswear department.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Charles Davis Limited, a listed Tasmanian company controlled by Sir Donald Trescowthick, acquired control of Harris Scarfe in 1976, when Charles Davis took over IMFC. Trescowthick wished to acquire Harris Scarfe, and his research indicated that the cheapest way of doing so was to take over its parent company. The Trescowthick era started with growth and ended with collapse in 2001.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Trescowthick focussed Harris Scarfe's activities on its retailing business and disposed of all of its other activities. The Rundle Mall store continued to develop as a full line department store, while the industrial products outlet at Mile End evolved to become Harry's, a large hardware retailing business. The success of Harry's led Harris Scarfe's parent company, Charles Davis Limited, to acquire other hardware retailers, including Lloyd's in South Australia, Campbell's in Queensland, and McEwans in Victoria and New South Wales.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<dl><dt>1980s</dt></dl>
<p>In 1989, these hardware businesses were sold in a management buyout, and acquired by Bunnings in 1993.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The Rundle Mall department store continued to prosper, offering a broad range of items at "value for money" pricing, with aggressive advertising. Sales were facilitated by a range of purchase options, including an in-house credit card and lay-by. Harris Scarfe's business was heavily promoted, with press and television advertising, and colourful advertising catalogues. These catalogues were broadly distributed in the <i>Sunday Mail</i> newspaper. As a result, Harris Scarfe built a large phone and mail order business, supported by the advertising catalogues.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<dl><dt>1990s</dt></dl>
<p>In the 1990s, Harris Scarfe began an era of unprecedented growth, both within South Australia and interstate. It expanded from its single large store in Rundle Mall into a smaller format for suburban and regional shopping centres (several of these stores were formerly occupied by the defunct Venture chain), as well as acquiring full-line department store sites from other retailers (including David Jones (Cairns, Townsville and Campbelltown NSW), John Martins (Elizabeth and Arndale), Myer (Colonnades), Centre Fair (Shepparton) and Stirlings (Albany, Bunbury and Geraldton)).
This growth began from the company's base in South Australia and was aided by the demise of the Venture chain of stores previously found throughout the country.  At Harris Scarfe's peak, the company operated 38 stores in all Australian States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The company continued its aggressive expansion interstate, opening stores in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The company acquired a large amount of its retail space (and its largest stores) as a result of Australia's two largest department store chains Myer and David Jones rationalising their store network. The company's expansion into Tasmania was accelerated by the merger with the Tasmanian department store chain FitzGerald's (better known to locals as "Fitzys") in 1995. Hence, Harris Scarfe played a key role in the rationalisation of Australian retailing in the 1990s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In 1994, Harris Scarfe opened its first store in suburban Adelaide, at Parabanks in Salisbury. Following this successful store opening (in a former Venture store), Harris Scarfe acquired more sites in South Australia, as well as expanding its activities to other States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>During 1995, Harris Scarfe assumed control of the FitzGerald's Department Stores chain, which had been operated as a separate subsidiary of Charles Davis Limited since it was acquired in 1986. Also in 1995, Charles Davis Limited changed its name to Harris Scarfe Holdings Limited, and it then focussed on its department store activities, disposing of all of its other businesses and investments. Harris Scarfe continued to grow, becoming Australia's third largest department store retailer, with 38 stores, and trading in all states of Australia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>
<dl><dt>2000</dt></dl>
<p>In 2000, Harris Scarfe established an online retailing subsidiary, leveraging on the existing successful mail and phone order business. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p>
<dl><dt>2001</dt></dl>
<p>Harris Scarfe's suppliers and customers, and even a large number of the company's staff, were shocked when the thriving business was suddenly faced with cash-flow problems. The company made headlines in South Australia when concerned suppliers, from whom Harris Scarfe had purchased large amounts of stock on credit, entered the flagship store in Rundle Mall, and began retrieving their stock directly from the shelves, before shocked staff and customers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>The company soon entered voluntary receivership, and its shares were withdrawn from the Australian Stock Exchange. Examination of the company's books revealed that assets had been re-valued well above market value in an effort to conceal its spiralling losses. This practice had left the company with multimillion-dollar debts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Harris Scarfe was sold to a private consortium, with the shareholders receiving little or no proceeds of the sale. The consortium set out to first stabilise the business, with possible expansion and a refloat on Australian Stock Exchange in the future.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>The consortium began a store rationalisation program as a measure to help restore profits. In the days after the purchase all stores in Queensland and New South Wales, where Harris Scarfe was under-represented, were closed. In its home state of South Australia, two suburban stores were closed: Munno Para in the north, and Woodcroft in the south. The same occurred in Victoria and Tasmania, with a limited number of unprofitable store closures. In the final stage of rationalisation, it was decided the business would also withdraw from the Western Australian market.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>It could be said that given the way in which the group evolved, with the acquisition of different retailers, the stores do not have a consistent style and layout. Some stores, including the store on Rundle Mall and in Hobart, were very old and had gone without significant modernisation or enhancement.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>The merchandise mix remains, unlike their competitors at the top end and the bottom end focused on mid-market brands. This includes Bonds, Tontine, and Jason. Private label is limited.

<p>The company then started a revitalisation program. The remaining stores were remodelled with new stock, new layouts and a new company logo. This was then followed by an extensive advertising campaign. As a result, Harris Scarfe soon began to enjoy record sales.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Harris Scarfe opened its first new store after the revitalisation, located at Werribee in Victoria. This was seen as a major step forward for the new company and resulted with much success in the growing Werribee area. This store was divested to Myer in 2007, as part of a deal whereby Myer has acquired a minority shareholding in Harris Scarfe.

<p>Harris Scarfe reopened their completely refurbished store at Colonnades SA as part of the centre's refurbishment. The store reopened with a reduction in floor-space, occupying only the ground floor of its original three-floor store. The upper levels were planned to house a new Best &amp; Less, JB Hi-Fi, and Cheap as Chips discount store. It was sold to Myer in 2007, along with the Elizabeth store.

<p>On 17 September Harris Scarfe opened a brand new store at Tea Tree Plaza in Modbury, South Australia. This store was meant to start a new era and new attitude for Harris Scarfe. The aim of this store for Harris Scarfe is to have two specialised stores under one roof, both homewares and fashion. Unfortunately, this approach has still not changed the level of acceptance of Harris Scarfe, as they are still considered as a Target and Kmart and not a Myer or David Jones of the retail world.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>On 2 October Harris Scarfe rebranded its Allens stores across NSW and ACT as Harris Scarfe.
