<p><b>InterstateÂ 99</b> (<b>I-99</b>) is an Interstate Highway with two segments: one located in central Pennsylvania, and the other in southern New York in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is near exitÂ 146 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70 and I-76) north of Bedford, where the road continues south as U.S. RouteÂ 220 (USÂ 220). The northern terminus of the Pennsylvania segment is near exit 161 of I-80 near Bellefonte. The New York segment follows USÂ 15 from the Pennsylvaniaâ€“New York border to an interchange with I-86 in Corning. I-99 passes through Altoona and State Collegeâ€”the latter home to Pennsylvania State Universityâ€”and is entirely concurrent to USÂ 220, within Pennsylvania. Long-term plans call for I-99 to be extended southward along the USÂ 220 corridor to an interchange with I-68 in Cumberland, Maryland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Unlike most Interstate Highway numbers, which were assigned by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to fit into a grid, I-99's number was written into SectionÂ 332 of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 by Bud Shuster, then-chair of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the bill's sponsor, and the representative of the district through which the highway runs. I-99 violates the AASHTO numbering convention associated with Interstate Highways, as it should lie to the east of I-97 but instead lies east of I-79 and west of I-81.

<p>I-99 begins at an indirect interchange with USÂ 220 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (designated as I-70 and I-76) north of Bedford. It begins concurrent with USÂ 220, which continues south from the interchange toward the Maryland state line as a two-lane highway known as the Appalachian Thruway. The interchange with the Turnpike requires drivers to use a short segment of USÂ 220 Business to access the Turnpike at exitÂ 146. North of the Turnpike junction, the limited-access highway becomes the Bud Shuster Highway as it heads through a rural portion of Bedford County. It connects to Pennsylvania RouteÂ 56 (PAÂ 56) just west of the Bedford County Airport at exitÂ 3 and PAÂ 869 at exitÂ 7 before crossing into Blair County. Here, it meets PAÂ 164 north of East Freedom at exitÂ 23 prior to entering the Altoona area.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In Hollidaysburg, a borough south of the city, I-99 and USÂ 220 connect to USÂ 22 at exitÂ 28, a large modified trumpet interchange. This junction allows travelers to head west towards Ebensburg, Johnstown, and Pittsburgh. The freeway continues to Altoona itself, where it indirectly connects to PAÂ 36 via exitÂ 32. Unlike the original routing of USÂ 220 which goes through the city center, I-99 and USÂ 220 mostly bypass it to the east, connecting to the city via streets leading eastward from the downtown district. At the northern edge of Altoona, PAÂ 764 joins the old alignment of USÂ 220 and parallels I-99 north for 3 miles (5Â km) toward Bellwood. PAÂ 764 leaves old USÂ 220 about 2 miles (3.2Â km) south of Bellwood, however, and terminates at I-99 exitÂ 39. Bellwood itself is served by exitÂ 41, which leads to PAÂ 865.

<p>The highway veers northeastward from Bellwood to serve the borough of Tyrone, located at the junction of old USÂ 220 and PAÂ 453. Access to the borough is made by way of exitÂ 48, which serves PAÂ 453. Past Tyrone, I-99 and USÂ 220 head through sparsely populated areas of Blair and Centre Counties. For this reason, only three exits exist between Tyrone and State College: exitÂ 52, serving PAÂ 350 and the small community of Bald Eagle, and exitsÂ 61 andÂ 62, which connect to USÂ 322 and the borough of Port Matilda. Here, USÂ 322 joins I-99 and USÂ 220 and follows them eastward to the State College area.

<p>At exitÂ 68 (USÂ 322 Business), I-99 merges into the Mount Nittany Expressway, an older, northerly bypass of State College. I-99, USÂ 220, and USÂ 322 follow the expressway to the Mount Nittany Interchange, a directional T interchange located on the northern fringe of the Pennsylvania State University campus. Beaver Stadium, the home of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team, is visible from I-99 at this point. USÂ 322 continues east through the interchange to follow the Mount Nittany Expressway while I-99 and USÂ 220 split from USÂ 322 and head northeastward toward Pleasant Gap, which I-99 connects to via exitÂ 81 and PAÂ 26. At this point, PAÂ 26 joins the freeway and follows it to Bellefonte, served by exitÂ 83 and PAÂ 550. The southern segment of I-99 ends about <span class="frac nowrap">1<span class="visualhide">Â </span>â„<sub>4</sub></span> miles (2.8Â km) later at an intersection with Musser Lane though the divided highway continues <span class="frac nowrap">â„<sub>3</sub></span> mile (0.54Â km) northeast to an interchange with I-80, where PAÂ 26 continues north and USÂ 220 joins I-80 east.

<p>The northern segment of I-99 is entirely concurrent with US 15, and starts at the Pennsylvania-New York border north of Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania. A four-lane freeway through the Steuben County town of Lindley, I-99 crosses through a rock cut, making a large bend to the north and bypassing the hamlet of Presho. The freeway enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with CRÂ 5 (Smith Road). After CRÂ 5, I-99 turns northeast through the town of Erwin, running to the west of the Indian Hills Golf Club. Making a gradual bend further to the northeast, the freeway crosses the Canisteo River and enters the hamlet of Erwins, where it enters a diamond interchange with NYÂ 417 (Addison Road). After NYÂ 417, it then turns alongside Norfolk Southern Railroad's Southern Tier Line (former Erie Railroad main line). Now paralleling the tracks and NYÂ 417, I-99/USÂ 15 crosses through Erwin, entering exitÂ 11, which connects to NYÂ 417 once again, next to Gang Mills Yard, the site of the former Painted Post station.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>After Gang Mills Yard, I-99 crosses through the Gang Mills section of Erwin, entering a large interchange at the northern end of the neighborhood. Signed exitÂ 12, this interchange serves CRÂ 107 (Robert Dann Drive) via NYÂ 417. After CRÂ 107, I-99 enters a large interchange that utilizes several flyover ramps between I-99, USÂ 15, I-86, and NYÂ 17 (the Southern Tier Expressway). Ramps are also present, connecting to NYÂ 352. This interchange serves as the northern terminus of both I-99 and USÂ 15.

<p>Corridor O of the Appalachian Development Highway System was assigned in 1965, running from Cumberland, Maryland (Corridor E, now I-68) to Bellefonte (I-80) along USÂ 220. The portion in Pennsylvania, from Bedford north to Bald Eagle, was upgraded to a freeway in stages from the 1960s to the 1990s. The first section, from USÂ 30 in Bedford to Pennsylvania Route 56 (PAÂ 56) near Cessna, opened in the latter half of the 1960s. Two more sectionsâ€”from PAÂ 56 north to modern exitÂ 15 in Blair County and from Charlottsville (exitÂ 45) to Bald Eagleâ€”were completed in the 1970s. The portion between exitÂ 15 and Altoona (exitÂ 33) was finished in the 1980s while the segment between modern exitsÂ 33 andÂ 45 was opened by 1997.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) was signed into law. It included a number of High Priority Corridors, one of whichâ€”CorridorÂ 9â€”ran along USÂ 220 from Bedford to Williamsport, and then north on USÂ 15 to Corning, New York. The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 amended ISTEA; among these amendments were that "the portion of the route referred to in subsection (c)(9) [Corridor 9] is designated as Interstate Route I-99." This was the first Interstate Highway number to be written into law rather than to be assigned by AASHTO. The number was specified by Representative Bud Shuster, who said that the standard spur numbering was not "catchy"; instead, I-99 was named after a street car, No. 99, that took people from Shuster's hometown of Glassport to McKeesport. I-99 violates the AASHTO numbering convention associated with Interstate Highways, since it lies east of I-79 but west of I-81.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Designation_and_Bald_Eagle_Ridge">Designation and Bald Eagle Ridge</span></h3>
<p>On November 6, 1998, AASHTO formally approved the I-99 designation, which initially extended 51.2 miles (82.4Â km) from the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bedford to PAÂ 350 in Bald Eagle. In 2002, plans were set in motion to extend I-99 northeast from Bald Eagle to State College via Port Matilda. The extension was fraught with issues, however. The proposed alignment for the highway north to Port Matilda proved to be controversial: while environmentalists called for I-99 to be constructed in the valley below Bald Eagle Ridge, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and valley residents favored a routing that took the freeway above the valley and along the side of the ridge. Farther north, the widening of Skytop, the mountain cut that USÂ 322 uses to traverse Bald Eagle Ridge, resulted in the exposure of acidic pyrite rock in 2003.

The blank spots on the overhead signs were reserved for I-99 shields.</div></div></div>
<p>Work on the segment ceased one year later as PennDOT attempted to stop the flow of acidic runoff from the site. The state remedied the situation by removing 1,000,000 cubic yards (760,000Â m) of pyrite and replacing it with a mix of limestone and fill, a process that took two years and cost $83Â million. With the environmental issues settled, construction resumed on the portion of the freeway south of Skytop Mountain. The section from Bald Eagle to Port Matilda was opened to traffic on December 17, 2007, while the remaining section between Port Matilda and the west end of the Mount Nittany Expressway near State College was completely opened on November 17, 2008. In all, the Bald Eagleâ€“State College section of I-99 cost $631Â million to construct.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>I-99 was extended northeastward to meet I-80 northeast of Bellefonte following the completion of the Bald Eagleâ€“State College segment. The connection was made by way of the pre-existing Mount Nittany Expressway and another, unnamed limited-access highway connecting the State College bypass to the Bellefonte area. The portion of the latter highway north of the PAÂ 26 interchange was originally built in the 1970s as a two-lane freeway connecting Pleasant Gap to I-80. At the time, it was designated solely as PAÂ 26. It was widened to four lanes in 1997. The piece connecting the PAÂ 26 freeway to the Mount Nittany Expressway was completed in 2002. USÂ 220 was rerouted via USÂ 322 and the new road, and the old alignment of USÂ 220 north of USÂ 322 was designated USÂ 220 Alternate on May 30, 2003.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>On June 27, 2014, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the interstate-grade USÂ 15 freeway from the Pennsylvania border to I-86 in Corning was officially signed as I-99.

<p>Though there is no specific date for completion, long-term plans call for I-99 to be extended northeastward along USÂ 220 from Bellefonte to Williamsport and northward along USÂ 15 from Williamsport to the New York border. Signs have been erected along the present USÂ 220 and USÂ 15 between Bellefonte and Corningâ€”much of which are built to Interstate Highway standardsâ€”marking the route as the "Future I-99 Corridor". Some of this section of road has also received exit number designations. The entirety of USÂ 15 north of Williamsport is a limited-access highway.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Some local Rochester, New York, area supporters have suggested that I-390, which extends north from I-86 24 miles (39Â km) west of the I-86/I-99 junction near Corning and which crosses I-90 and terminates in the greater Rochester metro area, be redesignated as I-99 once the I-80 to I-86 portion of that route is completed, positing that it is a logical extension of the I-99 corridor (I-99's predecessor, U.S. Route 15, originally extended to Rochester); no official moves to accomplish this have been forwarded, however.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>PennDOT has plans to build a high-speed interchange connecting I-99 to I-80 near Bellefonte. The new interchange will eliminate local access between PA 26 (Jacksonville Road) and I-80, which will be provided by a new exit 2 miles (3.2Â km) to the east. The first phase of the project will build the local access interchange between PA 26 and I-80. Bidding on the local access interchange is planned to begin on April 23, 2020 and construction is expected to be finished in December 2021. The local access interchange between PA 26 and I-80 will be funded by a $34 million federal grant. The second phase of the project will make improvements to Jacksonville Road between the new interchange and the junction between I-80 along with building the high-speed interchange between I-80 and I-99. Bidding on the second phase is planned to begin in March 2022, with the improvements to Jacksonville Road to be finished by December 2023 and the high-speed interchange to be completed by December 2025.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>An extension of I-99 by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), was under study in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina in the mid-2000s. Such a corridor would follow the U.S. Route 17 (USÂ 17) and USÂ 13 corridors, from Charleston, South Carolina, through the Norfolkâ€“Virginia Beach metro area and across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel complex, up the Delmarva Peninsula to Wilmington, Delaware. If the proposal were to be constructed and approved, it is unclear as to whether it would receive the "I-99" designation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>However, after commissioning a study in 2006, VDOT dismissed the proposal for several reasons. VDOT indicated that expenses in upgrading the Chesapeake Bay tunnels would be about $5Â billion. Also cited were the location of new highway alignments, and doubt as to whether other states, particularly South Carolina, would commit to the endeavor. Much of the highway along the corridor would need to be upgraded to Interstate standards, but portions of highway along the corridor have already been upgraded. In the 1990s, Delaware constructed a limited access facility on Delaware Route 1, paralleling USÂ 13 from Dover to Wilmington. Additionally, Delaware has considered upgrading the USÂ 113 corridor south of Dover, though, this deviates from the path suggested by VDOT. In Maryland, a portion of USÂ 13 is routed along a limited-access bypass around Salisbury.
