<p><b>Dr. Timothy Seow</b> is a Singapore-based Architect (1970s â€“ present). Active for more than 40 years, Seow and his team at IDS (International Design Studio) constitute one of the most significant architecture firms in South East Asia, with a record of projects in Singapore, Canada, China and the Middle East. He was one of the pioneers who came up with the concept of high-rise buildings integrated with exterior gardens and swimming pools or what he calls â€œbungalows in the airâ€. This model has been emulated by most residential developments in Southeast Asia. The concept was widely influential and was one of the most significant early developments of what came to be known as green architecture.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Timothy Seow was born and raised in Singapore. He was trained at Oxford Brookes University, London and during his travels was inspired by the architecture of San Francisco and Vancouver. When Seow later left his 30-year practice to join CPG Consultants, presently known as International Design Studio (IDS Studio) in 2003, he created quite a stir among his peers. Yet he claims this decision as the best move he has made in his career.
IDS Studio is a large organisation with international exposure and offices in China, India, Vietnam, Philippines, Australia, and the Middle East.

<ul><li><b> High-rise buildings </b></li></ul>
<p><b> Tong Building, Singapore </b> 
Located in Singapore's famous Orchard Road, this 19-story building was built in 1978. It is designed for mixed retail, commercial and residential purposes. It was one of the unique buildings of the mid-80â€™s because of its curtain wall look faÃ§ade. It had a setback concept creating a plaza where a wide variety of activities could take place. Even after 37 yrs, the Tong Building still retains its contemporary look. Seow won an honorable mention award by the Singapore Institute of Architects in the category of Commercial Projects.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p><b>Icon Residence, Malaysia</b>

It is located in Mont Kiara which is in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's federal capital. Icon Residence also won several awards.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p><b>Icon City, Malaysia</b>
This award winning building is located in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. The design was inspired by the random characteristics of mountainous rocks weathered by nature. It is a mixed development consisting of two residential towers, boutique offices, a shopping mall and a hotel.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<ul><li><b> Low-rise buildings </b></li></ul>
<p><b> St. Martin Residence, Singapore </b>
This building, built in 2001, is located on St. Martin's Drive, Singapore. It is a 4-story condominium with 82 housing units. The front view combines of both modern and traditional Asian elements.The idea behind this design was to create a vision of a tropical retreat on an urban island. 
This residency was awarded by the Singapore Institute of Architects in 2001 for its â€˜Excellency in Architecture.â€ 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p><b> Manama Lagoon, Bahrain </b>
This residential building in Manama, Bahrain is unique in terms of its collective design elements. The use of gardens terracing from level to level is its main design component. The architecture consists of a series of rectilinear forms. Each unit has its own intimate, unique space with views towards the landscaped courtyards and water features looking out towards the views of the Bahrain waters.  This building won the World Architecture News (WAN) award.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<ul><li><b>Institutional</b></li></ul>
<p><b> Nanyang Technological University, Singapore </b>
It is one of the top universities in the world, commonly known as NTU. Timothy Seow was the lead designer who designed the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM) at NTU which was completed in 2006. It is a 4-story building with sloped 'grass roofs'. Besides the aesthetic features, the roofs keep the temperature cool during day time. Its building consists of 3 interconnected blocks covered with roofs weaving in and out of the ground. The idea was to blend architecture with its landscape rather than dominate it. This building was one of the 4 international entries that received the Honour Award in 2007 for Innovative Learning Environments.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Seow is still prominent in the field of architecture and he continues to practice, focusing on his specialty, high-rise residential buildings with extensive gardens. He has carried his concept of â€œbungalows in the airâ€, first developed in the 1970s, into the 21st century with ever larger structures.
