<p>"<b>Song for the Lonely</b>" is a song recorded by American singer Cher for her twenty-fourth studio album, <i>Living Proof</i>. It was written by Mark Taylor, Paul Barry and Steve Torch, and produced by Taylor, and released on March 19, 2002, as the second single from the album, while in North America it was released as the lead single, by Warner Bros. Records and WEA. "Song for the Lonely" is a dance-pop song which lyrically evokes the September 11 attacks, although it was recorded before they happened.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Critical reception for "Song for the Lonely" was positive, with music commentators complimenting its heartfelt lyrics. However, the song was a disappointment on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, peaking at number 85. The accompanying music video for "Song for the Lonely" was recorded in New York City under the direction of Stu Maschwitz, and depicts Cher walking through the streets of the city since the 18th century until the modern days, while she is joined by several people from those times. To promote the song, Cher performed it on the American Music Awards of 2002, <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>, and included it on the setlists of her 2002–05 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour and her 2008–11 concert residency Cher.

<p>Cher recorded "Song for the Lonely" in summer 2001 in London and was going to include it on her twenty-fourth studio album <i>Living Proof</i>, and it immediately became her favorite song. However, after the September 11 attacks, she began thinking of it in a different way. In an interview with <i>Larry King Live</i>, at the time, she said: "After 9/11, I was listening to the album one day, and I started listening to that song, and all of a sudden it took on a completely different meaning because, when I listened to the words, oh, you know, when heroes fall in love and war, they live forever", she completed. Cher commented that "Song for the Lonely" was one of the best songs she has ever had the opportunity to sing, because before the attacks, "we still lived in a world of innocence". According to the album liner notes, "Song for the Lonely" is "dedicated to the courageous people of New York especially the fire fighters, the police, Mayor Giuliani, Governor Pataki and my friend Liz".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Since its release, public's reaction to "Song for the Lonely" had been positive. James Lonten, manager of a Borders Books &amp; Music store in New York City, which had been stocking <i>Living Proof</i> since its European release, commented, "That goes without saying. We play the track in-store, and it literally stops people dead in their tracks. It's an instantly affecting, highly emotional song". John Boulos, senior vice-president of promotion at Warner Bros. Records, said: "Obviously, we're not exploiting [the September 11 attacks] as a selling point to the single, but it has undeniably drawn the interest of people. We simply feel that we have an incredible song by a truly legendary artist. That's a pretty potent combination to take it to the street". "Song for the Lonely" served as the lead American single from <i>Living Proof</i>.

<p>"Song for the Lonely" is a guitar-laden dance-pop song. Mark Taylor and Paul Barry, who also worked on her previous hit single "Believe" (1998), wrote the track, "giving the song a frenetic, knee-bobbing urgency that will wash the gray out of any winter day", according to <i>Billboard</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Chuck Taylor. The music commentator also noted that the lack of vocoder, that had become a signature on Cher's songs, allowed Cher to "foster a grin" with opening notes, until the song reaches the chorus – which Taylor said it was one of the cathiest since Hanson's "MMMBop" (1997) – and "explodes into a rhythmic tantrum". When Cher recorded the track, she thought of it as a love song, but after the September 11 attacks, the singer felt the song was right for the occasion. "Since the world has changed so dramatically, the lyrics have a different weight. They're heavier, yet they're comforting at the same time. Over the past month or so, I've had a number of people tell me that the song has helped them cope. What a humbling compliment", she commented. Tony Peregrin from <i>PopMatters</i> noted that the song delivers "a message that is achingly emotional and somber".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h2>
<p>"Song for the Lonely" received generally positive reviews from music critics. While reviewing <i>Living Proof</i>, <i>Billboard</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Michael Paoletta commented that the song was "an empowering jam that deserves to rock the world just as "Believe" did". In a separate review for the single, Chuck Taylor from the same magazine opined that "Anyone who thought 'Believe' was merely a stroke of good fortune on Cher's mile-long scorecard will be singing a different tune after one spin of the life-affirming '(This Is) A Song for the Lonely  [<i>sic</i>]'", because "this track is so good, in fact, that it's up for debate as to whether it actually tops that previous winner". He finished his review by writing that "Boy, is "Song for the Lonely" ever an elixir for whatever ails you, a joyous romp with such mass appeal that its destination at the top of the charts seems a given".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Kerry L. Smith from AllMusic highlighted the song and praised, "Cher takes a brief break from her inquisitiveness about love to dedicate the bold, heartfelt opening track, in honor of the September 11th tragedy, 'Song for the Lonely' to 'the courageous people of New York, especially the firefighters, police, Mayor Giuliani, Governor Pataki'". Barry Walters of <i>Rolling Stone</i> also agreed by writing that it "clearly intends to evoke September 11th," adding "Coming from a willfully wiggy billion-dollar diva, this noble stuff feels calculated, particularly when it’s presented in such a sparkling, showbizzy package. Cher believes in love — no problem. Convincing us she's a selfless social commentator demands a much taller leap of faith." <i>Metro Weekly</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Gordon Ashenhurst called it a "rousing lead single". Sal Cinquemani from <i>Slant Magazine</i> noted that it "wisely abandons such (otherwise welcomed) electronic shenanigans for a pure and impassioned performance". Tony Peregrin of <i>PopMatters</i> deemed the song "an infectious, energetic track that rides the waves of predictable synth pads and pulsating beats".

<p>The accompanying music video for "Song for the Lonely" was directed by Stu Maschwitz, and was filmed in the streets of New York City in December 2001. A first-time director and a huge architecture enthusiast, Maschwitz sent Warner Bros. Records an idea for a Cher-guided tour through New York City's history, exemplified by a multiple reverse-timelapses of some of the great buildings of the city rising up before the viewer's eyes. After receiving news that he got the job following Cher's personal liking for the project, they would start filming the following weeks. The crew received special permission from Mayor Rudy Giuliani's office for live audio playback in the streets of Manhattan, a practice that had recently been outlawed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Cher had done her own makeup, due to her makeup artist Kevin Aucoin was nowhere to be found due to his struggling with a terminal illness. At one point of the shooting, they needed to cover some parts of the streets with big, loud smoke machines. As the events of 9/11 were still a fresh and painful memory for the city, complaints about the smoke started coming in. The police officer manning the intersection gave word that they would have to shut down their atmospheric effects, but they still had one more shot. The director solved this by taking Cher and the script supervisor's camera, and autographing a polaroid to the cop, to continue the last smoked-up shooting.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The video starts in Sepia tone, featuring Cher walking around the streets of New York City. While the setting for the start of the video is in the 18th century, the singer is dressed in modern-day clothes. The video progresses to black and white, and then to color, as the times for the setting of the video change to the 19th century through various eras to the 20th century. As the timeline changes, buildings around New York are shown being constructed. The video is intercept with shots of Cher dressed in white as an angel or God-like figure, which is overlaid in some shots, as well as shots of New York City from the air. People from each stage of the development of the city join Cher as she walks the streets until at the end, there is a large crowd of people from all eras. In 2002, the video was released on VHS to serve as promotion in the United States. An alternative version for the video for "Song for the Lonely" was included on the DVD <i>The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection</i> (2004).
