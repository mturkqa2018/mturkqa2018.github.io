<p><i><b>Where We Are</b></i> is the ninth studio album by Irish boy band Westlife. It was released on 27 November 2009 in Ireland and on 30 November 2009 in the UK through S Records, RCA Records and Sony Music. <i>Where We Are</i> is the group's first album following a break from music in 2008. This album was preceded by the lead single "What About Now" (a cover of the Daughtry song) and it was released on 23 October 2009 as a digital download a day later as a CD single.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The group collaborated with numerous notable producers for the album, notably Ryan Tedder of the pop rock band OneRepublic, Jim Jonsin, Greg Wells and Sam Watters, among others. <i>Where We Are</i> is also notably the first Westlife album not to have Steve Mac and Wayne Hector produce or write any of the songs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The album was met with mixed reviews, although it was still commercially successful, debuting at number two at the UK Albums Chart and got 2x Platinum Certification in the United Kingdom which sold more than 600 000 records. Despite the high peak, it was the first Westlife album not to peak at number one since their 2004 album <i>Allow Us to Be Frank</i> peaked at number three.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>Before Christmas 2008, they wrote a letter to their website saying that 2009 was going to be the most exciting year yet for Westlife. The recording process of their tenth album started on 1 July 2009. Byrne said that there will be many first-time producers and writers for the upcoming album. He also wanted to have collaboration works with Chris Martin of Coldplay who happens to be a big Westlife fan. Westlife worked with JC Chasez, Darren Hayes, Ben Adams, Adrian Bradford, and Guy Chambers for the album but all did not make the cut.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>
Filan talks about the content of the album and stated: <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><blockquote><p>A different direction might be a bit wrong. I think it's still pop music, but there's a different variation on it. One massive thing is we worked with different producers, who we've never worked with before, and new song writers. There are thirteen songs on the album and twelve of them are originals. There's more tempo, more rocky songs, some more American songs, some darker songs on there with darker lyrics. It's the best production we've had on any other album. The strings, the music is just on another level. Even if you're not a Westlife fan but you're a music fan, you will recognise the quality on this album.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p></blockquote>
<p>On their new biography posted on their official website, it has been added that the recording sessions began in LA, with a completely fresh team of producers and songwriters. The first song they recorded was the ballad, "I’ll See You Again", described as "haunting bereavement". "I'll See You Again" was recorded by Ross at Metropolis Studios. For their first single "What About Now" Feehily told <i>The Daily Mirror</i>, "We wanted the first single from our new album to be somewhere between the Westlife sound our fans know and love, and the new direction we're heading in. We've been experimenting with a fresh vibe on this record. After 11 years we see this as phase two of the Westlife story." The song "Shadows" which has been confirmed to be included on the album was written by Ryan Tedder and AJ McLean for the Backstreet Boys' seventh album <i>This Is Us</i> but was not selected for inclusion. It was subsequently purchased by record label boss Simon Cowell for Leona Lewis's second album <i>Echo</i> but it was later decided that the song was more suited to a boyband and thus given Westlife to record.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The album also contains an "in memory of" section to Nikky Byrne and Kevin Egan, the fathers of Westlife members Nicky Byrne and Kian Egan. The last song from the standard track listing of the album, "I'll See You Again", was included in the concert tour set list of the album. The song is established as the tribute song to their deceased fathers by putting their pictures at the background of the stage each time they performed it. The song is also the band's twelfth most streamed song in the United Kingdom as of January 2019.

<p><i>Where We Are</i> received mostly unfavorable reviews, with most reviewers criticizing the album's similar music style, as well as the fact that there is little difference from their previous material.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Robert Spellman of <i>Daily Express</i> gave the album two stars out of five, saying that "all the songs sound alike and deal with heartbreak." Lauren Murphy of <i>Entertainment Ireland</i> gave a similar score, stating that "as maudlin and one-dimensional as any of their recent material", although she praised Feehily's vocals. Rick Pearson of <i>London Evening Standard</i> called the album's songs "bland" and "uninspiring", concluding that "<i>Where We Are</i> finds Westlife exactly where they were at the beginning of the decade." Ben Chalk of <i>MSN UK</i> stated that the album is "aimed squarely at the sort of person who buys one album a year, usually at Christmas, to listen to in the car." Hugh Montgomery of <i>The Observer</i> criticized the album's "usual...over-production, ersatz yearning and (anti-)climactic key changes." Alex Fletcher of <i>Digital Spy</i> panned <i>Where We Are</i>, saying that "there isn't a drop of passion, genuine emotion or soul to be found anywhere." Ian Gittins of <i>Virgin Media</i> gave the album one star out of five, saying that "The only emotion...is a sinking sense of déjà vu."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic and <i>Rovi Music</i> gave the album three and a half stars out of five, noting the group's usual musical structure, although he praised the album for containing "many first-rate songs...and the production is polished to perfection." Mike Diver of <i>BBC Music</i> gave <i>Where We Are</i> a favorable review, referring to many "surprises" contained within the album, although he notes that "their style has barely changed."
