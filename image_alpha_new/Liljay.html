<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h3>
<p>Liao Xiao Jie's family consists of his parents, a younger sister, and a younger brother. His younger brother was also a member of <i>Bang Bang Tang II</i>, but he was eliminated in the second round. He also owns a female Chow Chow, called Lolly. It was bought by him and Zhuang Ao Quan in 2009.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In his childhood, Liao studied in Taipei Municipal Hulu Elementary School, Taipei Municipal Chongqing Junior School, and Taipei Municipal Song Shan High School of Commerce. He then went on to attend Takming University of Science and Technology where he met Zhuang. However, due to their busy lives after joining Lollipop, they later transferred to Hsing Wu College, where he is currently a student in the Department of Applied English.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>

<p>Besides studying in the same school, him and Zhuang are also members of a Taiwanese breakdance group Black Angle Crew. In June 2006, they went to Bang Bang Tang (BBT) Taipei audition together and both were selected into "Bang Bang Tang" television show. The first episode of BBT was aired on August 14, 2006.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>On November 27, 2006, the episode in which the six members of Lollipop were selected and revealed was aired. He was the first member to be selected into Lollipop. The members signed a contract to Channel V, and Dora Ao became their agent. They, then, officially signed a contract with EMI Capitol on December 2, 2006, appointing Zhuang as the leader of the newly formed group Lollipop. On December 9, 2006, Lollipop made its first public performance as a group at the V-Power Music Storm Concert.

<p>Lollipop's first EP, <i>Colorful Lollipop</i> was released on January 26, 2007, with six different covers, each featuring a member of the group. Four months later, on May 25, a second EP titled <i>Summer's First Experience</i> was released along with a photobook compiled with photos taken in Okinawa, as well as a DVD. Lyrics were written by Qiu and himself for the song "Summer's First Experience."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>During the summer of 2007, Liao and the other members of Lollipop made their acting debut in the drama <i>Brown Sugar Macchiato</i>, a collaboration with Hey Girl. The first episode was aired in Taiwan on July 15, 2007. Later, Lollipop admits on Kangxi Lai Le that the drama had been more of an introduction of the two groups instead of a major acting challenge, as the members were told to act like themselves, and that many subplots were explained only briefly due to the large number of main characters. After thirteen episodes, the drama ended on October 7, 2007. They released an official soundtrack, then, with songs from Lollipop and Hey Girl. Liao wrote the lyrics for the opening theme of the said drama, entitled "é»‘ç³–ç§€"(Hei Tang Xiu).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>On September 26, 2007, Lollipop visited Hong Kong to promote their television soundtrack Brown Sugar Macchiato. This was their first overseas promotional activity ever since their debut, and a huge fan turnout caused a great commotion at the shopping mall where they were having their autograph session. At the same time, Liao celebrated his birthday with thousands of fans in this event. At the same year, Lollipop began hosting their own show <i>Lollipop Gyashan</i> (LOLLIPOPå“ªè£¡æ€•) on October 27 until April 19, 2008, when the show stopped airing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Lollipop's debut album <i>Gyashan</i> (å“ªè£¡æ€•) was released on December 28, 2007. <i>Gyashan</i> entered Mandarin charts in the number one position, outselling F4's album <i>Waiting for You â€“ Await Your Love</i> (åœ¨é€™è£¡ç­‰ä½ ) which was released on the same day. Liao contributed lyrics to three of the ten songs in this album. On January 26, 2008, a year after the release of their first EP, Lollipop held its debut concert at the Taipei Arena. The concert DVD was released on June 6, 2008, breaking chart records with sales rates of more than 35%. The DVD has topped the charts for a period of one month since.

<p>Lollipop had been appearing regularly on <i>Bang Bang Tang</i> since August 14, 2006. With Channel [V]'s decision to select a new batch of boys and create a second season, Lollipop and most of the other members "graduated" from <i>Bang Bang Tang</i> after their last performances as members of the show. Their last official episode aired on August 29, 2008, marking the end of the first season. In total, the members of Lollipop had participated in more than 500 episodes of the show. However, since the start of <i>Bang Bang Tang II</i>, Liao had returned to the show as guest and co-host on several occasions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>After graduation from <i>Bang Bang Tang</i> television show, Liao began hosting <i>Na Li Wu Da Kang</i> (å“ªè£¡5æ‰“å‘) with Zhuang, Liu A-wei, Hey Girl's Apple and Channel V's VJ Rong Jia. The first episode was aired on September 7, 2008, while the last episode was aired on November 30, 2008. During this period, Liao also guest starred in <i>The Legend of Brown Sugar Chivalries</i>, as well as writing lyrics for two songs in this drama, including the opening theme, Cang Jing Ge (è—ç¶“é–£). On October 3, 2008, the original soundtrack was released by Gold Typhoon. Two editions were released for the soundtrack, one being a 10,000 limited edition.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>In November, 2008, Liao was injured during one of their dance practices. He performed with an injury in Singapore's Music Monster Festival on November 22, 2008 and V-Power Love Music Concert on November 29. The V-Power concert united Liao, Zhuang, and Liu with other Black Angle Crew members for a dance performance. Lollipop's participation in the concert also marks, symbolically, the two-year anniversary of the group's formation. A week later, on December 6, 2008, Lollipop performed four songs with themes of wushu at the 45th Golden Horse Awards ceremony. Liao wrote the rap for one of the songs in this performance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>In February, 2009, Channel [V] began filming its revamped version and new season of <i>Bang Bang Tang</i>, which marked the return of several members from the first season, which includes Lollipop. <i>Bang Bang Tang III</i> began airing on March 2, 2009, with Show Lo being the first guest star. However, with show host Fan Fan leaving the show to focus on her musical career, <i>Bang Bang Tang'</i>s last episode was aired on July 30, 2009. In 2009, Lollipop made its first lyric contributions to other artists, which are included in the mini album of the group Choc7, composed of seven members selected from the same show.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Lollipop's second album <i>I am Legend</i> was released on June 19, 2009. Liao contributed lyrics to four songs; and his first solo song is also recorded in this album. A concert tour in Asia with the same name commenced in Hong Kong Coliseum on July 4â€“5, 2009. While promoting <i>I am Legend</i> on several Taiwanese variety shows, including Kangxi Lai Le, 100% Entertainment, Azio Superstar, etc., Lollipop created a series of dance performances specifically for the show hosts of each show, thus completing a mini TV tour.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>On September 12, 2009, a short film in which Liao was cast as the main lead, and directed and shot by Liu A-wei called <i>The Great Escape</i> (å»–å•ä¹‹è¶ŠVé¢¨é›²) was aired on Channel [V] Taiwan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Liao lived with the other members of Lollipop from 2006 to 2009. Due to disturbances caused by fans gathering outside their apartment, Lollipop had to move several times since their debut and had once lived in an apartment rented to them by <i>BBT</i> show host Fan Fan in Taipei. However, at the end of 2009, Liao has moved away from Lollipop's apartment and is now living with Qiu Wang Zi and Qiu Mao Di.

<p>Lollipop's artist management contract with Channel [V] Taiwan ended at the end of 2009. Former Lollipop members, Qiu and himself had been undergoing a series of secret training for the past year after they had separated with the band in 2009. On July 8, 2010, the two of them released a single entitled <i>Dance Can Be Replaced</i> ("èˆžå¯å–ä»£"). On September 10, they had their first concert at the Hong Kong Kowloon Bay International Trade and Exhibition Center to promote their single. In the end, their first single was successful as they received six awards at the end of the year, which includes <i>"Popular Dance Song Award"</i> and <i>"Idol Award"</i> by the "Metro Radio Mandarin Hits Music Awards Presentation", <i>"Best Dance Song Award"</i> and <i>"Idol Award"</i> by the "Seventh Hit Golden King Awards", and <i>"Outstanding Dance Song Singers"</i> and <i>"Network Popular Singers"</i> by the "Chinese Golden Melody Awards".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>On the day of <i>A Legend Star Entertainment Corp.'</i>s first anniversary, Liao and Qiu Wang Zi decided to get back together and formed a new group called JPM, alongside Qiu's brother, Mao Di, on January 11, 2011. They signed a contract under A Legend Star Entertainment Corp., a company founded by former Channel [V] Taiwan director, Andy Chang. On August 26, 2011, JPM finally released their first album entitled <i>Moonwalk</i>. In this album, Liao filled the role of the producer for part of it.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Liao also continued his hosting career in <i>Fun Week Explosion</i> and <i>Apple Fun Week</i>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>On November 30, JPM released their second studio album entitled <i>365</i> under the same label, Sony Music Taiwan. They use "Love" as the main theme of this album. In other words, each song is used to describe different types and stages of love. In addition with the theme of love, 365 album also emphasized the "Golden Triangle" concept to capture each members' individual firm and confidence and also to represent their strong brotherhood. According to Sony Music, JPM said: "We are the Golden triangle, the best ally and best friend" (ã€Œæˆ‘å€‘æ˜¯é»ƒé‡‘éµä¸‰è§’ï¼Œæ˜¯æœ€å¥½çš„æˆ°å‹ä¹Ÿæ˜¯æœ€å¥½çš„æœ‹å‹ã€). Demonstrating the trio's mastery of a multitude of music styles, the new album's track list includes an electro-dance K-Pop-styled titular song "365 Days" especially produced by Korean producers. Moreover, the track list also includes a solo song for each member, and a collaboration with Kimberley Chen entitled "Internet". Once again, Liao took part in putting the album together as Liao filled the role of the producer for half of the album, lyricist of three songs and the composer of two songs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>Besides his music career, Liao Xiao Jie has been cast on Next TV's new television series called <i>æ„›å‘³ç”·å¥³</i> <small>(Flavor Lover)</small> as a main lead, Tang Ai Wei, together with Tsai Yi-chen.
