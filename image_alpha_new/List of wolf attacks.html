The coroner has been reported saying that the attack made by wolves and jackals and not by feral dogs. He based his statement on the fact that the body of the dead woman was dismembered and eaten. He also stated that dogs could not do this sort of attack. This statement is not supported by published literature where dogs are known to attack, kill, consume and dismember humans like other wild canids do. Final report has not been published yet (October 2, 2017) while genetic analysis is still pending on the species origin of the hair found over her body. Jackals are too small to cause such an attack while wild dogs, while feral or uncontrolled sheepdogs, are known to frequent the area.

As he prepared to stop and use the bike as a weapon, a couple in a Humvee pulling a trailer came to his aid, and threw the passenger door open as Hollan was attempting to climb through the window. The wolf furiously attacked the bicycle packs. The female rescuer unsuccessfully stood in the vehicle's doorway shouting at the wolf from 8 feet away as passing motorists honked their horns. She threw a water bottle that hit it in the head. It retreated to a ditch. Other motorists threw rocks at the wolf until it left.</td>

They didn't smell them or hear them â€” nothing,"--"I was rainbowing my pepper spray, and they fell back a little bit But as soon as we would turn our backs to try to go, they would run up on us, and we would turn around and start screaming again, and I would spray my pepper spray."--"We just kept pulling, and they were so big, and they started howling, and they were circling us. And it got us really panicked, and we kept screaming,"--"They were not afraid of us and I'm afraid that if I was out here by myself, they would attack me. They were not afraid," Camas Barkemeyer and Alycia Beiergrohslein described their situation, as they and one more friend together with their leashed dogs were surrounded by at least 7 wolves. Luckily only Barkemeyer's American bulldog Buddy had to undergo surgery to mend wounds caused by three attacking wolves after they had finally managed to escape from the thread.

Wanamaker was able to take shelter in an outhouse until the wolf left. She made her way to another outhouse and awakened campers sleeping nearby, who assisted her. Wolf biologist Mark McNay speculated that human-habituation and the wolf's young age were key factors in the attack. The wolf was not captured.

The pathologist who performed the autopsy, testified Carnegie had lost about 25% to 30% of his body mass in the attack, with the top midsection to the thigh having been partially consumed. Although originally the possibility that the culprit was a black bear was not ruled out, a coroners' jury concluded after a two-year inquiry that the suspects had indeed been a wolf pack.</td>

The wolf didn't growl; it just looked at him, John said later. Keith's mother, Teresa Thompson credits their family's dog with saving the boys. John thinks the dog rushed in to save him too. But the wolf fought off the Labrador retriever and went back after the boys. While the dog and the wolf were fighting, John said, he ran in mud boots about as far as the hospital room door - maybe 20 feet - before the wolf caught him and started biting. John received 19 laceration and puncture wounds on the back, legs, and buttocks, before adult arrived, fought the wolf off and shot it. First he was treated at a Yakutat health clinic and went home to Icy Bay the day after the attack. But two days later, John got really sick, his mother Diane Stenglein said, "He had a fever and said his feet felt like needles". In the Yakutat clinic John's stitches were removed and he was put on antibiotics. Doctors cut away the infected area in the small of his back so it would heal cleanly, the boy's back and legs were covered in bandages.
<p>The wolf was found to have been neither sick nor starving, but in "excellent condition" with good teeth and healthy deposits of fat around its organs. Although a rumor has circulated around both camps that someone had fed the wolf before the attack, but a necropsy of the wolf's carcass found no sign of human food in its stomach

They were answered by the howl of a solitary wolf. That night the Delventhals decided to sleep out under the stars. Young Zachariah was dreaming when he suddenly felt excruciating pain in his face. A lone wolf had bit him in the face and was dragging him from his sleeping bag. Zach screamed and Tracy, Zach's Mother, raced to his side and picked him up, saturating her thermal shirt with blood from Zach's wounds. The wolf stood menacingly less than a yard away. Tracy yelled at her husband, Thom, who leapt from his sleeping bag and charged the wolf. The wolf retreated and then charged at Tracy and Zach. The charges were repeated. Finally the wolf left. Thom turned a flashlight on 11-year-old Zach and saw, that the boy's face had been ripped open. His nose was crushed. Parts of his mouth and right cheek were torn and dangling. Blood gushed from puncture wounds below his eyes, and the lower part of his right ear was missing. Zach was taken to a hospital in Toronto where a plastic surgeon performed four hours of reconstructive surgery. Zach received more than 80 stitches in his face. Canadian officials baited the Delventhals' campsite and captured and destroyed a 60-lb wild male wolf. No further Â attacks have occurred since.

<p>Sellest oli juttu ka tolleaegses Rapla rajooni ajalehes "ÃœhistÃ¶Ã¶". 
See oli 1950.a., PÃµlvamaal, Prangli 4-kl. Algkooli naabruses elavat elanikku rÃ¼ndas marutÃµbine hunt. Olin 6-aastane, koos venna (3) ja vanatÃ¤diga peedipÃµllul. Meist mÃ¶Ã¶dus hunt, vÃ¤limuselt vibalik, peenike, pea longus. TÃ¤di, kes oli eluaegne karjus, pidevalt lambaid kaitsnud huntide eest, hakkas karjuma: hunt, hunt ja meie ka. Ã•nneks hunt ei pannud meid tÃ¤hele. Hunt sÃ¶rkis Prangli kooli poole ja mÃµne aja pÃ¤rast kostis inimeste kisa.
Kooli direktor nÃ¤gi hunti tulemas naabite juurde ja hÃ¼Ã¼dis naabrimeele, et hunt on sinu aia taga. Mees, kes oli Siberis paljude huntidega vÃµidelnud, otsustas hundile vastu hakata. Ta hÃ¼ppas Ã¼le aia, Ãµnnetuseks seljaga hundi poole, rÃ¼nnak tuli ootamatult, mees vÃµttis kÃ¼ll hundi pea haardesse, kuid hunt ulatas kÃµri kallale. Mehe vapper naine surus rusika hundi kurku ja nii pÃ¤Ã¤stis mehe elu. Hunt lasti maha. Kannatanud viibisid haiglaravil.
LÃ¤bi metsatuka viis minu koolitee ( 600m), mis oli talvel hundikarja poolt sisse sÃµtkutud. Hommikuti liikus vÃ¤ike rongkÃ¤ik kooli poole: eespool vÃ¤ikene koer, jumalalaulev vanaema laternaga, mina, viimasena suurem koer. ||
