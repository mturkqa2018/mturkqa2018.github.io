<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Merrill was born <b>Moishe Miller</b>, later known as <b>Morris Miller</b>, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York. He was the son of tailor Abraham Miller, originally Milstein, and his wife, Lillian (nÃ©e Balaban), Jewish immigrants from Pultusk, Poland, near Warsaw. His paternal grandparents were Berl Milstein and Chana (nÃ©e Mlawski), both from Pultusk, Poland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>His mother claimed to have had an operatic and concert career in Poland (a fact denied by her son in his biographies) and encouraged her son to have early voice training: he had a tendency to stutter, which disappeared when singing. Merrill was inspired to pursue professional singing lessons when he saw the baritone Richard Bonelli singing Count Di Luna in a performance of <i>Il Trovatore</i> at the Metropolitan Opera, and paid for them with money earned as a semi-professional pitcher.

<p>In his early radio appearances as a crooner he was sometimes billed as <b>Merrill Miller</b>. While singing at bar mitzvahs and weddings and Borscht Belt resorts, he met an agent, Moe Gale, who found him work at Radio City Music Hall and with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. With Toscanini conducting, he eventually sang in two of the maestro's NBC broadcasts of famous operas, <i>La traviata</i> (with Licia Albanese, in 1946), and <i>Un ballo in maschera</i> (with Herva Nelli, in 1954). Both of those broadcasts were eventually released on both LP and CD by RCA Victor. His ranking as an important NBC performer is evidenced by his inclusion in NBC's 1947 promotional book, <i>NBC Parade of Stars: As Heard Over Your Favorite NBC Station</i>, displaying Sam Berman's caricatures of leading NBC personalities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Merrill's 1944 operatic debut was in Verdi's <i>Aida</i> at Newark, New Jersey, with the famous tenor Giovanni Martinelli, then in the later stages of his long operatic career. Merrill, who had continued his vocal studies under Samuel Margolis made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as winner of the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air in 1945, as Germont in <i>La traviata</i>. Also in 1945, Merrill recorded a 78 rpm record set with Jeanette MacDonald, featuring selections from the operetta <i>Up in Central Park</i>; MacDonald and Merrill did two duets together on this album.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 1951, Merrill recorded a series of duets with the Swedish tenor Jussi BjÃ¶rling for RCA Victor, including a world-renowned recording of "Au fond du temple saint" from the opera <i>Les pÃªcheurs de perles</i> by Georges Bizet.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1952 Merrill, BjÃ¶rling, and Victoria de los Ãngeles made a widely admired RCA Victor recording of Puccini's <i>La bohÃ¨me</i>, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1953, Merrill, BjÃ¶rling, de los Angeles and Zinka Milanov recorded the complete <i>Pagliacci</i> and <i>Cavalleria rusticana</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Metropolitan_Opera">Metropolitan Opera</span></h2>
<p>His role in the musical comedy film <i>Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick</i> (1952) led to a conflict with Sir Rudolf Bing and a brief departure from the Met in 1951. Merrill sang many different baritone roles, and after the untimely on-stage death of the celebrated Leonard Warren in 1960, became the Met's principal baritone, sharing that position in a few years with Cornell MacNeil.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he appeared under the direction of Alfredo Antonini in performances of arias from the Italian operatic repertoire for the open air <i>Italian Night</i> concert series at Lewisohn Stadium in New York City.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>He was described by <i>Time</i> as "one of the Met's best baritones". Yet reviews were not consistently good: <i>Opera</i> magazine reported on a Metropolitan Opera performance of <i>Barber of Seville</i> in which Merrill delivered "by all odds the most insensitive impersonation of the season".  He was accused by the reviewer of "loud, coarse sounds" and "no grace, no charm, as he butchered the text and galumphed around the stage".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Later_career">Later career</span></h2>
<p>Merrill appeared on "Voice of Firestone" with Joanne Hill.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Merrill also continued to perform on radio and television, in nightclubs and recitals. In 1973, Merrill teamed up with Richard Tucker to present a concert at Carnegie Hallâ€”a first for the two "vocal supermen" (as one critic dubbed them), and a first "for the demanding New York public and critics," Merrill recalled. The event marked a precedent that eventually led to the "Three Tenors" concerts many years later. Merrill retired from the Met in 1976. In 1977, he appeared on the TV special "Sinatra &amp; Friends," soloing "If I Were A Rich Man" and performing "The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York" with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. For many years, he led services, often in Borscht Belt hotels, on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In honor of Merrill's vast influence on American vocal music, on February 16, 1981 he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. In 1964, this award was "established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In 1996, at a reception at Lincoln Center, Merrill was presented with The Lawrence Tibbett Award from the AGMA Relief Fund, honoring his fifty years of professional achievement and dedication to colleagues. The AGMA Relief Fund, award sponsor, provides financial assistance and support services to classical performing artists in need.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sporting_events">Sporting events</span></h2>
<p>Relatively late in his singing career, Merrill also became known for singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Yankee Stadium and Giants Stadium. He first sang the national anthem to open the 1969 baseball season, and it became a tradition for the Yankees to bring him back each year on Opening Day and special occasions. He sang at various Old Timer's Days (wearing his own pinstriped Yankee uniform with the number "1â€‹<span class="frac nowrap">â„<sub>2</sub></span>" on the back) and the emotional pre-game ceremony for Thurman Munson at Yankee Stadium on August 3, 1979, the day after the catcher's death in a plane crash. He also sang at one World Series game in each year the Yankees played the Fall Classic at the stadium, starting in 1976.  A recorded Merrill version is still sometimes used at Yankee Stadium, mainly at Old Timer's Day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Merrill preferred a traditional approach to the song, devoid of additional ornamentation, as he explained to <i>Newsday</i> in 2000, "When you sing the anthem, there's a legitimacy to it. I'm extremely bothered by these different interpretations of it." Merrill appeared as himself in a cameo role, singing the national anthem, in the 2003 film <i>Anger Management</i>. Merrill joked that an entire generation of people know him as "The 'Say-Can-You-See' guy!" (<i>Agmazine</i>, April 1996).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>While there has been dispute regarding his birth year (some claim he was born in 1919), the Social Security Death Index, his family, and his gravestone state that he was born in 1917.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Merrill was married briefly to soprano Roberta Peters in 1952. They parted amicably; he had two children, a son David and a daughter Lizanne, with his second wife, Marion (d. March 20, 2010), nÃ©e Machno, a pianist. Merrill liked to play golf and was a member of the Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York, for many years.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>He always maintained a warm sense of humor and once recalled the time a young contractor was working in his New Rochelle, New York, home. Surveying the photos, posters, plaques and other music memorabilia in the Merrill home, the young man asked Merrill, "You're a singer, aren't you?"
"Yes," he responded. "You sing opera, don't you?" the worker asked. "A little," replied Merrill.
(Agmazine, April 1996).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>He wrote two books of memoirs, <i>Once More from the Beginning</i> (1965) and <i>Between Acts</i> (1976), and he co-authored a novel, <i>The Divas</i> (1978). Merrill toured all over the world with his arranger and conductor, Angelo DiPippo, who wrote most of his act and performed at concert halls throughout the world. He always donated his time on the Cerebral Palsy Telethon with Dennis James.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Death">Death</span></h2>
<p>Merrill died at home in New Rochelle, New York, while watching Game 1 of the 2004 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals. He is interred at the Sharon Gardens Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, which is the Jewish division of Kensico Cemetery. His headstone features an opera curtain that has been drawn open.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>His epitaph states:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p>
<dl><dd>Like a bursting celestial star, he showered his family and the world with love, joy, and beauty. Encore please.</dd></dl>
