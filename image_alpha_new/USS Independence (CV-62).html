<p>The fifth <b>USS <i>Independence</i> (CV/CVA-62)</b> was an aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. She was the fourth and final member of the <i>Forrestal</i> class of conventionally powered supercarriers. She entered service in 1959, with much of her early years spent in the Mediterranean Fleet.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p><i>Independence</i> was decommissioned in 1998 after 39 years of active service.  Stored in recent years at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, the ex-<i>Independence</i> was towed beginning on 10 March 2017 to Brownsville, Texas for scrapping. She arrived on 1 June 2017 and is currently being dismantled.

<p>The <i>Forrestal</i>-class aircraft carriers were designed in the early 1950s as a smaller version of the cancelled <i>United States</i>-class "supercarriers". Unlike the <i>United States</i> class, they were to operate in both the nuclear strike and conventional roles, and were therefore intended to carry a mixed fleet of fighters, light attack and heavy attack aircraft, all of which were to be jets. The carriers were designed around the large new Douglas A3D Skywarrior bomber, with four deck-edge aircraft elevators large enough to handle the new bomber. As jet aircraft needed much more fuel than piston-engined aircraft, the <i>Forrestal</i> class had a much greater aviation fuel capacity than existing carriers, with 750,000 US gallons (2,800,000 l) of Avgas and 789,000 US gallons (2,990,000 l) of jetfuel, more than double that carried in the <i>Midway</i>-class aircraft carriers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p><i>Independence</i> was built with an angled flight deck with four C-7 steam catapults, two on the bow and two on the angled deck. She was fitted with AN/SPS-37 long-range search radar and AN/SPS-8B height finding radar. Defensive armament consisted of eight 5"/54 caliber Mark 42 guns mounted on sponsons jutting out from the sides of the ship so they did not interfere with the flight deck. The initial air wing of the <i>Forrestal</i>-class carriers was about 90 aircraft, although this varied with the composition of the airwing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The contract to build <i>Independence</i>, the fourth <i>Forrestal</i>-class carrier was awarded to the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 2 July 1954, with the ship being laid down on 1 July 1955. She was launched on 6 June 1958 by the wife of Thomas S. Gates, the Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 10 January 1959.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Testing_and_workup">Testing and workup</span></h3>
<p><i>Independence</i> conducted shakedown training under her first captain, Captain R. Y. McElroy, with the first landing-on being carried out by a Grumman Trader carrier onboard delivery aircraft on 2 March 1959. She arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia on 30 June 1959, and then carried out a ten-week training cruise in the Caribbean. During these trials, while carrying out compatibility tests aboard the new carrier, a Douglas A3D Skywarrior was catapulted off <i>Independence</i> at a gross weight of 84,000 pounds (38,000 kg), the heaviest aircraft to take off from a carrier at the time.

<p><i>Independence</i> operated off the Virginia Capes for the next year on training maneuvers, and departed 4 August 1960 for her first cruise to the Mediterranean. There, she added her great strength to the peace-keeping power of the 6th Fleet in that troubled region, remaining in the eastern Mediterranean until her return to Norfolk 3 March 1961. On 4 August 1961, she departed again for the Mediterranean to join the US 6th fleet for another cruise and returned on 19 December 1961 to Norfolk.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p><i>Independence</i> sailed on 19 April 1962 for Sixth Fleet duty in support of President John F. Kennedy's firm stand on Berlin during a recurrence of stress in a critical area. She returned to Norfolk 27 August and sailed 11 October for the Caribbean Sea. Called on by President Kennedy on 24 October during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, <i>Independence</i> provided a strong, visible reminder of U.S. determination and resolve while she acted as a key participant in the U.S. naval blockade of Cuba. She arrived off Puerto Rico in response to the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba and took part in the quarantine operations which finally forced withdrawal of those missiles. She then returned to Norfolk on 25 November for readiness exercises along the eastern seaboard, overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p><i>Independence</i> departed Norfolk on 6 August 1963 to take part in combined readiness exercises in the Bay of Biscay with sea-air units of the United Kingdom and France then entered the Mediterranean on 21 August for further duty with the Sixth Fleet. Cruising throughout the Mediterranean, she gained much valuable experience during combined NATO exercises, including close air support to Turkish paratroops, reconnaissance, communications, and convoy strike support. President Makarios of Cyprus paid her a visit on 7 October 1963, after which she took part in bilateral U.S.-Italian exercises in the Adriatic with Italian patrol torpedo boats, and U.S.-French exercises, which pitted her aircraft against French interceptors and a surface action with the French cruiser <i>Colbert</i>. She returned to Norfolk on 4 March 1964.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Following training exercises, ranging north to New York and south to Mayport, Florida, <i>Independence</i> departed Norfolk 8 September 1964 for NATO Teamwork exercises in the Norwegian Sea and off the coast of France, then to Gibraltar. She returned to Norfolk 5 November 1964 and entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

<p>On 10 May 1965, <i>Independence</i> deployed for more than seven months, including 100 days in the South China Sea, off the coast of Vietnam, the first Atlantic Fleet carrier to do so. She also was the fifth U.S. carrier to operate off Vietnam. <i>Independence</i> and her embarked Air Wing 7 received the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 5 June to 21 November 1965. The carrier's air group participated in the first major series of coordinated strikes against vital enemy supply lines north of the Hanoi-Haiphong complex, successfully evading the first massive surface-to-air missile barrage in aviation history while attacking assigned targets, and executing, with daring and precision, the first successful attack on an enemy surface-to-air missile installation. The carrier launched more than 7,000 sorties, sustaining an exceptional pace of day and night strike operations against military and logistic supply facilities in North Vietnam. "The superior team spirit, courage, professional competence, and devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of <i>Independence</i> and embarked Attack Carrier Air Wing Seven reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Naval Service."

<p><i>Independence</i> returned to her homeport, Norfolk, arriving 13 December 1965. During the first half of 1966, she operated off Norfolk, replenishing and training air groups. On 4 May 1966, she participated in Operation Strikex. The carrier departed Norfolk 13 June for European operations with the Sixth Fleet. <i>Independence</i> was involved with unit and NATO exercises from July into December. She then continued her Sixth Fleet deployment returning to CONUS in early 1967. After a few months of local operations, she underwent an extensive overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The drydock portion of the overhaul was interrupted when <i>Independence</i> had to leave drydock early to make way for the fire-damaged <i>Forrestal</i> on 19 September 1967.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: 1967 USS Forrestal fire</div>
<p>On 30 April 1968, <i>Independence</i> steamed to the Mediterranean Sea for a nine-month deployment. She returned to Pier 12 NOB Norfolk, Virginia on 27 January 1969. On 3 September 1969, the Independence departed Norfolk to participate in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, (NORLANT), where she participated in testing the Hawker Siddeley Harrier in flight deck operations, returning home on 9 October 1969. <i>Independence</i> was again deployed to the Mediterranean on 23 June 1970, returning to Pier 12 on 31 January 1971. It was during this cruise that the ship was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation in support of actions against the PLO during the Jordanian crisis.

<p>Deploying from Norfolk in September 1971, the crew earned the designation as 'Blue Nose' sailors when the <i>Independence</i> crossed the Arctic Circle on 28 September. During subsequent operations in the North Sea, <i>Independence</i> conducted cross-deck operations with the British aircraft carrier HMS <i>Ark Royal</i> and transited the English Channel en route to the Strait of Gibraltar and scheduled operations in the Mediterranean Sea.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In May 1973, President Richard M. Nixon delivered his annual Armed Forces Day address from the decks of <i>Independence</i>. While based in Norfolk, the ship made deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. From 8 to 13 October 1973, Task Force 60.1 with <i>Independence</i>, Task Force 60.2 with <i>Franklin D. Roosevelt</i>, and Task Force 61/62 with <i>Guadalcanal</i> were alerted for possible evacuation contingencies in the Middle East as a result of the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Arab states and Israel. <i>Independence</i> operated off the island of Crete.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In the summer of 1974, <i>Independence</i> departed Norfolk for yet another 'Med Cruise', operating with CTF 60.1 and CVW-7. Relieving <i>Franklin D. Roosevelt</i>, <i>Independence</i> and <i>Saratoga</i> continued the tradition of steaming the Mediterranean while being shadowed by Soviet aircraft and ships. On 8 September 1974, sailors were introduced to the new concept of terrorism when a bomb exploded in the cargo compartment of TWA Flight 841 high above. Steaming to the crash site, <i>Independence</i> and other ships spent two days retrieving the remains of the ill-fated jetliner, her crew, and passengers.

<p>On 19 November 1980, <i>Independence</i> with Carrier Air Wing Six (AE) embarked, deployed to the Indian Ocean along with the cruiser <i>Harry E. Yarnell</i> and was on watch along with <i>Ranger</i> on "Gonzo Station" as President Reagan took office and the Iranian Hostages were freed. Subsequently, completing an Indian Ocean cruise, <i>Independence</i> transited the Suez Canal northbound, shortly after <i>America</i> had transited southbound, making <i>America</i> the first United States Navy carrier (and, thus, <i>Independence</i> the second) to transit the Suez Canal since <i>Intrepid</i> in 1967. <i>Independence</i> completed a deployment of 204 days. Scheduled to go to Singapore, the crew was instead diverted to the Persian Gulf to back up <i>Nimitz</i> during the Iran Hostage Crisis mission with Capt. Thomas E. Shanahan Commanding. After the Gulf, <i>Independence</i> and her battle group visited Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 2 February to 7 February for R&amp;R. Upon completion of the deployment, Captain Shanahan was promoted to rear admiral.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>In 1982, <i>Independence</i> provided critical support to the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon. On 25 June, the greatest concentration of U.S. Navy air power in the Mediterranean Sea resulted when the battle groups of <i>Forrestal</i> and <i>Independence</i> joined forces with <i>Dwight D. Eisenhower</i> and <i>John F. Kennedy</i>. After steaming together in the eastern Mediterranean Sea for several days, <i>Forrestal</i> and <i>Independence</i> relieved <i>Dwight D.

On 25 October 1983, aircraft from <i>Independence's</i> embarked air wing flew missions supporting the invasion. Returning to Lebanon that same year, the ship's air wing conducted air strikes against Syrian positions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>In 1984, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>On 17 February 1985, <i>Independence</i> arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to undergo a modernization and overhaul program to extend her service life by 15 years. The flight deck was improved to allow the recovery of high-performance aircraft while the ship traveled at slower speeds, and the NATO Sea Sparrow launchers were upgraded. Other improvements improved the ship's fuel consumption. <i>Independence</i> completed the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in June 1988. Setting sail 15 August 1988 from Norfolk, the ship transited the tip of South America and arrived at her new homeport of NAS North Island, in San Diego, California, 8 October.

<p>In June 1990, with Carrier Air Wing 14 embarked, <i>Independence</i> departs San Diego on a routine WESTPAC. On 2 August, in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, <i>Independence</i> was sent to deter further Iraqi aggression during Operation Desert Shield. Arriving on station in the Gulf of Oman on 5 August, <i>Independence</i> was the first carrier to enter the Persian Gulf since 1974. The ship remained on station for 112 days and permanently reestablished a U.S. naval presence in the region. She returned to San Diego on 20 December 1990.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p><i>Independence</i> changed homeports again on 11 September 1991—this time to Yokosuka, Japan, embarking Carrier Air Wing 5 and becoming the Navy's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier, and flagship for Commander, Carrier Group Five.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>On 23 August 1992, <i>Independence</i> entered the Persian Gulf, under the Command of Captain Carter B. Refo prepared to enforce an Allied ban on Iraqi flights over south Iraq below the 32nd parallel north. On 26 August, President George H. W. Bush announced that the United States and its allies had informed Iraq that in 24 hours allied aircraft would fly surveillance missions in southern Iraq and were prepared to shoot down any Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel. The action was precipitated by Iraq's failure to comply with U.N. Resolution 688, which demanded that the Iraqi government stop the repression of its Shiite population in southern Iraq.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Persian Gulf allies began to enforce the ban on Iraqi planes from flying south of the 32nd parallel on 27 August in Operation Southern Watch. Any Iraqi planes that violated the ban would be shot down. Twenty Navy aircraft from CVW-5 aboard <i>Independence</i> in the Persian Gulf were the first coalition aircraft on station over Iraq as Operation Southern Watch began. Southern Watch was the enforcement of a ban on Iraqi warplanes and helicopters from flying south of the 32nd parallel.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p><i>Independence</i> became the most battle experienced ship in the Navy's active fleet, and the first carrier in history to hold that distinction, on 30 June 1995. With this honor, <i>Independence</i> displayed the Revolution-era First Navy Jack, commonly called the "Don't Tread On Me" flag, from her bow until her decommissioning. The flag was presented to <i>Independence</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s commanding officer Capt. David P. Polatty III in a formal ceremony on 1 July.

<p>In March 1996, <i>Independence</i> was deployed to the waters east of Taiwan to provide a stabilizing presence amid the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. She was joined in the area by <i>Nimitz</i> as the People's Republic of China lobbed missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters. On returning to Yokosuka in April 1996, the ship was visited by President Bill Clinton as part of an official state visit to Japan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>In 1997, <i>Independence</i> made a four-month deployment, covering several major exercises and seven ports of call.

<p>After decommissioning, <i>Independence</i> remained in mothballs for five and a half years before being struck on 8 March 2004. During her time in mothballs, the ship was said to have been heavily stripped to support the active carrier fleet, especially the remaining <i>Kitty Hawk</i>-class aircraft carriers. Her port anchor and both anchor chains were used on the new <i>Nimitz</i>-class aircraft carrier USS <i>George H.W. Bush</i>. The recycling of parts and the poor material condition of the ship at the time she was withdrawn made a strong argument against retaining her as a potential museum ship. In April 2004, Navy officials identified ex-<i>Independence</i> as one of 24 decommissioned ships available to be sunk as artificial reefs. However, as of February 2008, she was scheduled to be dismantled in the next five years along with USS <i>Constellation</i>. At that time, she was still available for donation as a reef while awaiting a contract for her dismantling to be awarded.

<p>On 26 January 2012, the Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command posted a notice of solicitation for the towing and complete dismantlement of multiple CV-59/CV-63 Class Aircraft Carriers in the United States, including <i>Forrestal</i>, <i>Independence</i>, and <i>Constellation</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>Following the disposal of <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Constellation</i>, on 10 March 2017 ex-<i>Independence</i> began her 16,000 mile journey from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Brownsville, Texas for dismantling by International Shipbreaking Limited. On 26 April 2017, she was on her way through the Strait of Magellan, and on 30 May 2017 she arrived at Brownsville, where a special ceremony was held at Isla Blanca Park for veterans, school children and members of the local community to honour the vessel.
