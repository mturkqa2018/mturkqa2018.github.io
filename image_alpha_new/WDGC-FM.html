<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>WDGC was founded by Fred Moore in 1965, with its first station having been a janitor's closet and the first transmitter having been built in a shoebox. It was created from a drama club experiment and funded by parental donations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>In 1966, it was on the airwaves, but just barely. It was then known as WDGN (most likely for its Downers Grove North roots) and ran on only one watt of power. The WDGN transmission used the PA system to broadcast. The signal was so weak it could only be heard on 600 AM and if a listener placed their radio by a PA speaker. After numerous phone calls to Washington, D.C. and two rejected applications to contact the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), WDGC was granted a construction permit on November 25, 1968 which in turn allowed the station build a transmitter facility capable of broadcasting to Downers Grove and other surrounding communities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>On March 17, 1969, the station license was finally approved and WDGC was broadcasting with 10 watts of power on 88.3 FM. From 1968 until 1972, the station occupied an unused classroom on the west end of the third floor. That space was divided into three rooms; the main studio (control room which included the transmitter), a news and announcers booth, and an engineers area (including the record library and UPI teletype machine). During the same time frame, the South Campus of DG High School had its own studio facilities, which shared broadcast time with the North studios.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 1972, the station moved from its third floor "studio" to a self-contained building north of the main school. This building was once a "portable classroom". It became the home of WDGC-FM, as well as new operations WDGC-TV and Cable 99. Shortly thereafter, on July 14, 1974, the radio station was licensed for a directional 250 Watts.  A used transmitter was bought and re-tuned and the station enjoyed improved coverage in many directions. Four years later it made the final jump to stereo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1981, the station was granted a room to be turned into a classroom/studio at Downers Grove North where it still presently remains.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Between 1982-1984, the station hosted the popular 'Chris and Dave Smorgasbord' talk-variety show which was often controversial for how it broke the mold of the traditional music-based programming format.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>During the mid-1980s, many notable musicians worked at the station, including Jim Cooley (Blue Meanies) and Bob DeMaa. Moore retired in June 1993.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In 1997, the old transmitter was replaced with a new 250 watt transmitter.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 1998, the station purchased digital Pacific Research and Engineering Airwave consoles for both studios. The cart machines at the North studio were replaced with Sony minidisc systems and a non-linear computer based audio editing program.  North teacher John Waite and DGN student Stuart Allard played a major part in building the station's minidisk library for a variety of genres, and many of those minidisks are still used to this day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In 2007, the studio at Downers Grove South was renovated, creating a less cluttered environment in the main studio and adding on two sub-studios for the adjacent classroom to practice in.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In June 2010, WDGC went online. Listeners can access the stream at WDGC OnLine. This move was made with the help of WDGC alumni Blane Webster and Dave Zarembka. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In 2010, the club at Downers Grove South became almost entirely student-led as it established a club board; which consists of a president, program director, promotions director, and treasurer.  Some past presidents include Samantha Brooks and Jacob Szpytek, while the current president is Ian Lane.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Radio_Classes_and_student_DJ_requirements">Radio Classes and student DJ requirements</span></h2>
<p>Radio Shows are open to all North and South students grades 9–12 without having to pass Radio class. In Radio I, students learn the basics of radio programming, history, and performance as well as how to run on-air shows. Students work with a volunteer student DJ who shows them how to master the high school radio station equipment.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Although not required to become a student DJ, students may continue their education through Radio classes levels II and III. In Radio II, students learn advanced editing techniques and produce programming for on-air use while creating an audio portfolio. The Radio III course is an independent study class giving students hands-on experience running a station while they produce specialty programming. All three levels of Radio classes are one semester long.
