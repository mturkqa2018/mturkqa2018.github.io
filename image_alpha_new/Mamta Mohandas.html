<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Mamta Mohandas was born on 14 November 1984 to Ambalappat Mohandas and Ganga into a Malayali family which originally hails from Kannur (Kerala). She attended the Indian School, Bahrain until 2002 and is an alumna of the School. She pursued a Bachelor's degree at Mount Carmel College Bangalore. She modeled for print ads for companies such as IBM and Kalyan Kendra and modeled on the ramp for the Mysore Maharajah and Raymonds. Mamta is trained in Karnatic and Hindustani music.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<p>Mamta debuted in the 2005 Malayalam film <i>Mayookham</i>, directed by Hariharan. Although the film did not do well at the box office, Mamta attracted attention for her sensitive portrayal of Indira.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Subsequently, she acted alongside Mammootty in <i>Bus Conductor</i>, with Suresh Gopi in the films <i>Adbutham</i> (2006) and <i>Lanka</i> (2006), and alongside Jayaram in <i>Madhuchandralekha</i> (2006). She also played the female lead in <i>Baba Kalyani</i> with Mohanlal. Later that year, she dÃ©buted in the Tamil film industry, starring in the Karu Pazhaniappan directed film <i>Sivappathigaram</i> opposite Vishal (actor), which turned out to be an average grosser.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 2007 she acted with Mammootty in the film <i>Big B</i>. She eventually stepped into the Telugu film industry as well, when she appeared in a supporting role in the film <i>Yamadonga</i>, directed by SS Rajamouli. The film became one of the biggest hits of the year. She had lent her voice for a couple of songs in this film too. In 2008, she appeared in 7 films, predominantly in Telugu-language films. Her first release was her dÃ©but Kannada film <i>Gooli</i>. She then starred in the film <i>Krishnarjuna</i>, playing the lead female role, which did not do well at the box office. <i>Victory</i> was her next assignment as lead actress, but that film also failed at the box office, following which she appeared in a cameo role in her only Tamil release that year, <i>Kuselan</i>, alongside Tamil superstar Rajinikanth. Three more Telugu releases featured Mamta, including <i>Homam</i>, directed by JD Chakravarthy and Srinu Vaitla's <i>King</i> opposite Nagarjuna. In both these films she also performed as a playback singer in several songs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 2009, she starred in the comedy film <i>Guru En Aalu</i> alongside Madhavan, and the thriller <i>Passenger</i>, sharing screen space with Dileep and Sreenivasan, respectively. While the former had an average run at the box office, the latter was declared a surprise sleeper hit in Malayalam. The film 'Passenger' in which she played the role of a television reporter 'Anuradha', became a turning point in Mamta's career.Mamta was initially approached to play the lead role in the 2009 Telugu dark fantasy "Arundathi".But she refused the offer and the movie later went on to become one of the highest grosser that year. In 2010, she worked with Jayaram in the critically acclaimed <i>Kadha Thudarunnu</i> directed by Sathyan Anthikkad, for which she won her first Best Actress Award from Filmfare. This film also won her the 'Vanitha award for best actress â€“ Malayalam', the 'Mathrubhumi award for best actress â€“ Malayalam' and the 'Asianet award for the best actress- Malayalam '. Other projects in 2010 included <i>Musafir</i> with Rahman, <i>Anwar</i> with Prithiviraj, and <i>Kedi</i> with Nagarjuna. Mamta's first film in 2011 was the Malayalam film <i>Race</i>, in which she played the role of Niya, wife of a cardio surgeon Abey (Kunchacko Boban). The film failed to do well at the box office. Her next release in Malayalam was <i>Naayika</i>. In 2012, Mamta appeared in her third Tamil film, <i>Thadaiyara Thaakka</i> directed by Magizh Thirumeni. In 2013 she starred in <i>Paisa Paisa</i> with Indrajith. In 2014 she starred in <i>To Noora with Love</i> in which she plays a Muslim character. She has made a comeback to Malayalam movie industry with Ranjith Shankar's Mammooty starrer "Varsham". She shared her screen space again with Dileep in "Two Countries" after doing a box office hit movie with him named "My Boss"
In 2016, she starred opposite to Mammootty in Thoppil Joppan and she also signed a movie Baby sitter alongside Biju Menon. In early 2017, she signed Crossroad (2017 film) an anthology film in which she plays an orthodox Muslim. She also appeared in an extended cameo in Udaharanam Sujatha with Manju Warrier. In mid 2017, she signed Detroit Crossing aka Ranam opposite to Prithviraj but had to opt out because she did not have fresh dates to allocate for the project.

She went on to win the 2006 Filmfare Best Female Playback Singer Award for that song.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Subsequently, she was asked to sing several songs for composer Devi Sri Prasad, including the chart buster "Akalesthe Annam Pedtha" for the Chiranjeevi-starrer <i>Shankardada Zindabad</i> (later dubbed as <i>Daddy Mummy</i> in the Tamil film <i>Villu</i>), "36-24-36" for the film <i>Jagadam</i>, "Mia" for <i>Tulasi</i>, and "Ghanana (Funny)" and the title song for the film <i>King</i>.
