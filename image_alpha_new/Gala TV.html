<p><b>Gala TV</b> was a bingo channel in the United Kingdom, launched in 2006 by Gala Bingo. The channel was removed from the satellite lineup in 2011. It continued as an online television channel, and in 2012 was renamed as Gala Live.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Gala TV broadcast 24 hours a day. AutoBingo ran throughout the day. Then live bingo ran from 5pm to 1am. Viewers could register on the website or by using a freephone telephone number. Players then used the website to purchase tickets for, and play, the bingo games.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The channel launched on 4 October 2006, replacing Avago. The channel was due to be launched on 13 September 2006 but it was held back by technical problems. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>When Gala TV first launched, it was produced by Endemol West and the live studio was located in Bristol with the automated service playout based at Wapping Studios in London. At the time, Gala TV had a very classic approach to the channel. They had a team of five presenters and seven callers. The studio was real and had a cold and classic feel and there was also no interaction with the viewers. Also most of the presenting was done by one presenter. At this point Gala TV broadcast live from 5pm to 1am.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In February 2007, Gala TV underwent a massive rebrand. The graphics, idents and adverts were completely changed. The studio also went a change with the new bingo display screen. The presenting style also changed with three presenters and two callers on each night meaning there could be two presenters in each hour. There was much more presenter and viewer interaction. The new Automated Service featuring a prerecorded caller was still being built, so the older automated service was run for a few more months. It eventually launched in July. On Friday and Saturdays in September and October, Gala TV moved their live hours to 5.30pm to 1.30am as a trial to see if the upcoming new hours would work.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>The next change came in November 2007. A new game was introduced to the live schedule called the "Ultimate Flyer". This meant that there were now nine games in each hour. The presenting style also changed back to a slight more serious approach with some hours being led by only one presenter. Also Gala TV moved their live hours to 6pm to 2am after a successful trial in previous months.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In February 2008, another change to the studio took place. Two bubble lamps appeared either side of the screen. These have been removed as they constantly stopped working. These were replaced originally with two white tubes with backlights however after a month they were replaced with two tubes filled with bingo balls.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In June 2008, Gala TV and Gala Bingo launched the Live TV Bingo room where players could view the show live on their PCs as well as playing along with the games. Also players can chat with other players and also chat with the presenters and callers in the studio. Also around this time all the adverts and idents were remade in 3D and using a green screen effect on many of the adverts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>On Monday 1 December 2008, Gala TV's daytime schedule underwent a massive change. Gala TV launched a new roulette product to be broadcast at several times throughout the day. Also Gala Casino's Poker Tour was broadcast twice during the daytime. The whole series was run through twice. In January this was removed from the daytime schedule due to poor viewing figures with more people opting to play bingo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Sunday 1 February 2009 saw the biggest change to date with a new production company ETV Productions taking over from Endemol. The live studio moved to Battersea Studios in London with the set being a mix of real and virtual with a significantly improved level of presentation. Each night there are two presenters and two callers. There is now much more interaction with the viewer by the use of player walls and maps. The virtual set was dark with a sunset scene in the background. The virtual graphics solution was provided by RT Software. All of the adverts were refreshed as well with some being made by professional companies and presenters.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>On Tuesday 2 March 2009, Gala TV went online 24 hours a day. Due to this all Gala Casino related programs were scrapped in order for non-stop 24-hour bingo. Gala Roulette only lasted three months.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In June 2009, Gala TV started broadcasting on High Street TV to advertise the channel lower down on the sky platform. The show broadcasts in widescreen from 11pm to 7am daily. This only lasted three weeks as High Street TV broadcast other shopping TV promotions on the channel.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>On Monday 4 January 2010, after a number of requests by Gala TV players, the live show was moved back to 5pm to 1am, meaning that players could enjoy live bingo one hour earlier. Another reason for the move was the number of people playing originally in the 1am hour was low.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Since Friday 1 April 2011, Gala TV has only been available via GalaBingo.com and no longer broadcasts on Sky channel 861. On the same date, Gala TV was given a full revamp of its virtual studio and the show itself had more emphasis on the community aspect rather than the bingo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>In July 2012, another revamp to the show took place. Since Gala TV hasn't actually broadcast on TV, the show was renamed Gala Live and the automated bingo part of the channel was scrapped. A reduction of the presenting team also took place as now callers are not featured on the show and presenters spend the majority of the time socialising with the community chat room.
