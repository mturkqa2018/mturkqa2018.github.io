<p><b>James Conley Justice II</b> (born April 27, 1951) is an American coal mining and agriculture businessman and politician serving as the 36th Governor of West Virginia since 2017. With a net worth of around $1.9 billion, he is the wealthiest person in West Virginia. He inherited a coal mining business from his father and successfully built a massive business empire with over 50 companies, including The Greenbrier, a luxury resort. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>In 2015, Justice switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party and announced his candidacy for governor in the 2016 election. He ran as a Democrat and defeated the Republican nominee, Bill Cole. Less than seven months after taking office, Justice switched back to the Republican Party the day after announcing his plans at a President Trump rally in the state.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>James Conley Justice II was born in Charleston, the son of James Conley Justice and Edna Ruth (née Perry) Justice. Justice grew up in Raleigh County, West Virginia. He enrolled at the University of Tennessee on an athletic scholarship for golf, but transferred to Marshall University. At Marshall, he was a two-year captain on the Thundering Herd golf team. He earned his bachelor's degree and Master in Business Administration from Marshall.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Business_career">Business career</span></h2>
<p>After college, Justice went into the family agriculture business. Justice founded Bluestone Farms in 1977, which now operates 50,000 acres (20,000 ha) of farmland, and is the leading producer of grain on the East Coast of the United States. During that time, he also developed Stoney Brook Plantation, a 15,000-acre hunting and fishing preserve in Monroe County. Justice is a seven time national corn growing champion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>After the death of his father in 1993, Justice inherited ownership of Bluestone Industries and Bluestone Coal Corporation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 2009, he sold some of his coal business to the Russian company Mechel for $568 million. In 2015, after a huge drop in the price of coal which led Mechel to close some of the mines, he bought the business back for just $5 million. Since buying back the mine from Mechel, Justice re-opened several of the mines and hired over 200 coal miners.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Justice's mining companies have a history of safety violation and unpaid taxes; in 2016, <i>NPR</i> called him the "top mine safety delinquent" in the United States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Justice owes millions of dollars to the government in back taxes, and unpaid coal mining fees and fines: "His mining companies owe $15 million in six states, including property and minerals taxes, state coal severance and withholding taxes, and federal income, excise, and unemployment taxes, as well as mine safety penalties, according to county, state and federal records."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Justice serves as the owner or chief executive officer of over 50 companies, including The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, which he bought for $20.5 million in 2009, preventing its bankruptcy.  When Justice first took control he immediately brought back all 650 laid-off employees. He added vacation and health benefits to their contracts and offered a 10 percent raise if the hotel regained its fifth star.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Justice is in the process of building a new mountain top golf course with golfers Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Lee Trevino. Arnold Palmer was involved before his 2016 death.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Forbes estimates Justice's net worth at $1.6 billion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>As of 2014, he owned 70 active mines in 5 states. His charitable activities have included $25 million for the James C. Justice National Scout Camp at The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, $5 million for Marshall University, and $10 million to the Cleveland Clinic.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Justice gives away more than $1 million in Christmas gifts annually through the Dream Tree for Kids campaign.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Before taking office as governor, Justice resigned from all the executive positions he held at his business. He placed his daughter Jill in charge of The Greenbrier and his son Jay in charge of his mining and agriculture businesses. He has said he will place all his assets in a blind trust, but that the process will take time because of their complexity.

<p>In 2015, Justice declared his candidacy for Governor of West Virginia in the 2016 election as a member of the Democratic Party. He had been a registered member of the Republican Party until changing his registration in February 2015. This was his first time running for political office. In May 2016, Justice won the Democratic nomination for governor and ran against Republican nominee Bill Cole in the general election. On November 8, Justice won the election.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Justice was endorsed by the United Mine Workers.

<p>Justice took office as governor on January 16, 2017. He is known for using colorful metaphors and digs at political opponents.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>To improve West Virginia's budget situation, he has proposed raising the state's revenue by $450 million, primarily by increasing the consumer sales tax, reinstituting the business and occupation (B &amp; O) tax, and establishing a "rich man's" tax. He also opposed plans to cut health and education spending. On April 13, 2017, while vetoing a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled West Virginia Legislature, Justice said the bill was "nothing more than a bunch of political you-know-what" and showed a prop featuring bull feces on a print copy of the bill.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>On August 3, 2017, Justice announced that he had rejoined the Republican Party. He made the announcement at a Donald Trump rally in Huntington and also confirmed his support for the sitting President. Justice said that he was returning to the GOP because he could not help Trump as a Democrat. The announcement came as a surprise to his own staff. This also made Justice the first Republican governor of West Virginia since Cecil Underwood in 2001.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Even after switching to the Republican Party, Justice endorsed incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin for reelection in the 2018 Senate election in West Virginia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_positions">Political positions</span></h3>
<p>Justice began his gubernatorial campaign and career as a conservative Democrat. <i><i>Time</i></i> magazine identified him as a moderate Democrat. However, as noted above, he switched to the Republican Party a few months after taking office and declared his support for President Donald Trump.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_policy">Economic policy</span></h4>
<p>Justice campaigned and has governed with support for the coal industry. He does not support raising taxes, but has supported increasing teachers' salaries arguing that increased state revenue will pay for the increased budget spending. In 2017, Justice said that he opposed budget cuts and supported raising sales taxes. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Justice an "F" grade based on their positions, but Justice voiced his disagreement with the rating.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_policy">Social policy</span></h4>
<p>On abortion, Justice had said that he does not support abortion, but that the Supreme Court had decided the issue. Later, Justice attended a rally supporting Amendment 1, a state constitutional amendment intended to ban abortion if <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is overturned. He is considered pro-life and signed two anti-abortion bills into law. Justice supports gun ownership and loosened gun laws. In 2016, Justice had a 0% rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). In 2018, however, Justice signed into a law a bill allowing gun owners to keep their guns locked in vehicles on their employers' property, and this was a bill supported by the NRA. He also signed a bill legalizing hunting on Sundays on private land. On healthcare, Justice does not support repealing the Medicaid expansion that resulted from the Affordable Care Act. Regarding LGBT issues and same-sex marriage, Justice has taken a nuanced position. He did not say whether he supports or opposes same-sex marriage, and, instead, stated that he respects the Supreme Court decision, <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. In 2016, Justice opposed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Opinion_about_global_warming">Opinion about global warming</span></h2>
<p>According to the <i>Charleston Gazette–Mail</i>, Justice has equivocated on the scientific consensus on global warming. In an interview with the paper, he said: "There's documentation that would give one concern, and I don't think you should ignore that," he said. "At the same time, I think there's an awful lot of research that still should be done. [...] I surely wouldn't sit here and say I am a believer in global warming, but I wouldn't sit here and say that I am not concerned."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Justice lives in Lewisburg, West Virginia. He met his wife, Cathy (<i>née</i> Comer) in high school. They have two children, Jay and Jill. He stands at 6 feet and 7 inches.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Justice is a lifelong fan of the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL), and spent $30 million to develop a training facility for the team to use in 2014 at The Greenbrier. He hosts the Greenbrier Classic, a PGA Tour event, at The Greenbrier annually.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Youth_sports">Youth sports</span></h3>
<p>Since 1992 Justice has been president of Beckley Little League. His participation has helped the program expand to over 1,000 children playing on 80 teams.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Having lived in Lewisburg since 2001, he has been the girl's basketball coach at Greenbrier East High School since 2003, having won the state championship in 2012. In 2011, he also became the head coach for the boy's basketball teams, a position from which he stepped down in September 2017. He was the only coach at the AAA level (the state's largest classification) who coached both the girls and boys basketball teams. Justice stated that though he will place his business interests in a blind trust upon becoming governor, he will still coach basketball while serving.  In discussing the coaching position, Justice said, "There are three things I know that I can do, and that shoots a shotgun, make a deal and coach basketball. I'm excited about it."
