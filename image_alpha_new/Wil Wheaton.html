<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra "Debbie" Nordean (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist. He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy. Both appeared uncredited in the <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> episode "When the Bough Breaks". Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film <i>The Curse</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_work">Early work</span></h3>
<p>Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film <i>A Long Way Home</i> (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film <i>The Secret of NIMH</i> (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book <i>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</i> (1971). He had a minor role in <i>The Last Starfighter</i> (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in <i>Stand by Me</i> (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella <i>The Body</i> which was originally published in 1982's <i>Different Seasons</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Star_Trek"><i>Star Trek</i></span></h3>
<p>He played Wesley Crusher for the first four seasons of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, from 1987 to 1991. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his <i>Star Trek</i> character and, by extension, Wheaton himself. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>

And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my website and people who I've talked to since I started going to <i>Star Trek</i> conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Wheaton's notoriety among <i>Star Trek</i> fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, <i>ArcaneTimes</i> (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position; <i>Something Positive</i> presents a range of opinions on the storyline <i>Mike's Kid</i>; and <i>Abstruse Goose</i> tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.

<p>Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film <i>Toy Soldiers</i> (1991). After leaving <i>Star Trek</i>, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product. Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning <i>The Good Things</i> (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker. For his performance in <i>Jane White Is Sick &amp; Twisted</i> (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.

<p>Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of <i>The Weakest Link</i> featuring <i>Star Trek</i> actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series <i>Numb3rs</i>, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series <i>Criminal Minds</i>, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for <i>LoadingReadyRun</i> (and a reprise of the same the following year, in <i>CommodoreHustle 4</i>), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series <i>Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show</i>. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series <i>The Guild</i> as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy. Wheaton credits his roles in <i>Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show</i> and <i>The Guild</i> for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character. He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the television series <i>Leverage</i>, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek &amp; Sundry, including hosting <i>TableTop</i>, a board game based show, and <i>Titansgrave</i>, a roleplaying game based show.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, starting in season 3, episode 4: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on <i>Eureka</i>, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side. Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast <i>Welcome to Night Vale</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Wheaton played Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series <i>Dark Matter,</i> based on the eponymous comic book.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hosting">Hosting</span></h3>
<p>From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called <i>InDigital</i> along with Jessica Corbin and Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012. He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series <i>Falling Skies</i> that appears on-line after each episode.   On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called <i>The Wil Wheaton Project</i> would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes. However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Games">Games</span></h3>
<p>In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas.

<p>In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled <i>Dancing Barefoot</i>. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity." Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. <i>Dancing Barefoot</i> sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired <i>Dancing Barefoot</i>, and published his extended memoirs, <i>Just a Geek</i>, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a <i>Star Trek</i> book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir. Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, <i>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</i> was again published by Monolith Press.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>With the release of <i>Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler</i> in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, <i>Sunken Treasure</i> contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, <i>William's Tell</i> and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released <i>Memories of the Future: Volume 1</i>, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of <i>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</i>, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. <i>The Happiest Days of Our Lives</i> and <i>Sunken Treasure</i> were also released on a Creative Commons license.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>In 2017, Wheaton wrote the short story "Laina" for the <i>Star Wars</i> anthology <i>From a Certain Point of View</i>. The book features 40 short stories, each by a different author, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of <i>Star Wars</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span></h3>
<p>Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005. In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them." In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, <i>The Real War on Christmas</i>, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas. Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Wheaton is a supporter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote address for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online. He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the  Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee. He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Immediately following the Sutherland Springs church shooting on November 5, 2017, Wheaton on Twitter stated in response to Congressman Paul Ryan's call for prayers for the victims that "The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they'd still be alive, you worthless sack of shit." Wheaton subsequently clarified his opinion after receiving criticism.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p>

When one son was 19, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He enjoyed brewing his own beer at home, and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.
