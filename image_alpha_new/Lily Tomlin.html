<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Tomlin was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Lillie Mae (<i>nÃ©e</i> Ford; January 14, 1914Â â€“Â July 12, 2005), a housewife and nurse's aide, and Guy Tomlin (March 3, 1913Â â€“Â October 24, 1970), a factory worker. She has a younger brother named Richard Tomlin. Tomlin's parents were Southern Baptists who moved to Detroit from Paducah, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. She is a 1957 graduate of Cass Technical High School. Tomlin attended Wayne State University and originally studied biology. She auditioned for a play, and it sparked her interest in a career in the theatre and she changed her major. After college, Tomlin began doing stand-up comedy in nightclubs in Detroit and later in New York City. She continued studying acting at the HB Studio. Her first television appearance was on <i>The Merv Griffin Show</i> in 1965.

<p>In 1969, after a stint as a hostess on the ABC series <i>Music Scene</i>, Tomlin joined NBC's sketch comedy show <i>Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In</i>.  Signed as a replacement for the departing Judy Carne, Tomlin was an instant success on the already established program, in which in addition to appearing in general sketches and delivering comic gags, she began appearing as the regular characters she created; they became well known and she portrayed them outside of the show in later recordings and television specials:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<ul><li><b>Ernestine</b> was a nosy, condescending telephone operator who generally treated customers with little sympathy. Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore her hair in a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical "one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy", and, "is this the party to whom I am speaking?" In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phoenicia, another operator.<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="829" data-file-width="659" decoding="async" height="226" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Lilly_Tomlin_Edith_Ann_1975.JPG/180px-Lilly_Tomlin_Edith_Ann_1975.JPG" srcset width="180"/> <a name="image2"><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div><div style='border: 3px solid red'><center><h1 style='color:red'>2</h1></center></a></div>Tomlin as Edith Ann, 1975</div></div></div> Tomlin reprised the role in 2016 for a TV ad as part of PETA's campaign against SeaWorld, Tomlin has also reprised the role on several episodes of Sesame Street.</li>
<li><span id="Edith_Ann"></span> <b>Edith Ann</b> is a precocious five-and-a-half-year-old girl who waxes philosophical on everyday life, either about life as a kid or things for which she feels she has the answers, although she is too young to fully understand. She often ends her monologues with "And that's the truth", punctuating it with a noisy raspberry. Edith Ann sits in an oversized rocking chair (to make Tomlin seem child-sized) with her rag doll, Doris, and often talks of life at home with her battling parents and bullying older sister, Mary Jean (Lily Tomlin's given birth names). Edith Ann has an oversized, playfully aggressive dog named Buster and a boyfriend named Junior Phillips, a possibly unrequited love. (Only Edith Ann and "Doris" appear in the Edith Ann sketches.) Tomlin voiced her in two prime-time cartoon adaptations of the character that aired on ABC in 1994.</li>
<li><b>Mrs. Judith Beasley</b> is a housewife and mother from Calumet City, Illinois, who is often chosen for television commercials and offers "good consumer advice". She appears in the film <i>The Incredible Shrinking Woman</i> as the lead character's neighbor.</li>
<li><b>Mrs. Earbore (The Tasteful Lady)</b> is a somewhat prudish and prissy, conservatively dressed middle-aged apolitical woman who dispenses advice on gracious living and a life of elegance.</li>
<li><b>Susie the Sorority Girl</b> is a blonde collegiate who could be the Tasteful Lady's daughter. Humorless and melodramatic, her biggest worries are the likes of who took her missing album by The Carpenters.</li>
<li><b>The Consumer Advocate Lady</b> is a dour, austere woman who rigidly inspects and tests products for their alleged value.  The Consumer Advocate Lady is something of a variation of Mrs. Beasley.</li>
<li><b>Lucille the Rubber Freak</b> is a woman addicted to eating rubber, whose monologue details her habit from its beginning (chewing the eraser on pencils) to her obsessive rock bottom (eating the tip off mother's cane). Tomlin performed this character as part of her <i>Laugh-In</i> audition.</li>
<li><b>Tess/Trudy</b> is a homeless bag lady who accosts theater-goers and various passers-by with her offbeat observations and tales of communications with extraterrestrials. ("They don't care if you believe in 'em or notâ€”they're different from God.")</li>
<li><b>Bobbi-Jeanine</b> is a showbiz veteran of the lounge circuit where she sings and plays organ. She often dispenses advice. ("It's not called Show Art, it's Show Business.")</li></ul>
<p>Tomlin was one of the first female comedians to break out in male drag with her characters <b>Tommy Velour</b> and <b>Rick</b>. In 1982, she premiered <b>Pervis Hawkins</b>, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after Luther Vandross), with a mustache, beard, and close-cropped afro hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In 1970, AT&amp;T offered Tomlin $500,000 to play her character Ernestine in a commercial, but she declined, saying it would compromise her artistic integrity. In 1976, she appeared on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> as Ernestine in a Ma Bell advertisement parody in which she proclaimed, "We don't care, we don't have to...we're the phone company." The character later made a guest appearance at <i>The Superhighway Summit</i> at UCLA on January 11, 1994, interrupting a speech being given on the information superhighway by then-Vice President Al Gore. She appeared as three of her minor characters in a 1998 ad campaign for Fidelity Investments that did not include Ernestine and Edith Ann. In 2003, she made two commercials as an "updated" Ernestine for WebEx.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Tomlin brought Edith Ann to the forefront again in the 1990s with three animated prime-time television specials. She published Edith Ann's "autobiography" <i>My Life</i> (1995), co-written with Jane Wagner.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recordings">Recordings</span></h3>
<p>In 1972, Tomlin released <i>This Is A Recording</i>, her first comedy album on Polydor Records in 1972 that contained Ernestine's run-ins with customers over the phone. The album hit #15 on the Billboard Hot 200, becoming (and remaining as of 2011) the highest-charting album ever by a solo comedienne.  She earned a Grammy award that year for Best Comedy Recording.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Tomlin's second album, 1972's <i>And That's The Truth</i>, a collection of monologues as Edith Ann, was nearly as successful, peaked at #41 on the chart and earning another Grammy nomination. (Tomlin has two of the  three top charting female comedy albums on Billboard, sandwiching a 1983 Joan Rivers release.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Tomlin's third comedy album, 1975's <i>Modern Scream</i>, a parody of movie magazines and celebrity interviews featured her performing as multiple characters, including Ernestine, Edith Ann, Judith, and Suzie. Reviewing in <i>Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies</i> (1981), Robert Christgau said: "When I hear Tomlin impersonate Suzie Sorority or explain how she managed to play a heterosexual in <i>Nashville</i> ('I've seen these women all my life, so I know how they walk, I know how they talk'.) I thank God for making us a woman comedian instead of another light comedienne. Next time, though, I hope She makes her a little funnier."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Her 1977 release <i>Lily Tomlin On Stage</i>, was an adaptation of her Broadway show that year. Each of these albums earned Tomlin additional Grammy nominations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Tomlin recorded a single/EP called "The Last Duet" with Barry Manilow.

<p>Tomlin made her dramatic debut in Robert Altman's <i>Nashville</i>, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; she played Linnea Reese, a straitlaced, gospel-singing mother of two deaf children who has an affair with a womanizing country singer (played by Keith Carradine). The Oscar that year went to Lee Grant for her role in <i>Shampoo</i>. A comedy-mystery, <i>The Late Show</i>, teaming Tomlin with Art Carney, was a critical success in 1977. One of the few widely panned projects of Tomlin's career was 1978's <i>Moment by Moment</i>, directed and written by Wagner, which teamed Tomlin in a cross-generational older woman/younger man romance with John Travolta.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In 1980, Tomlin co-starred in <i>9 to 5</i>, in which she played a secretary named Violet Newstead who joins coworkers Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton in seeking revenge on their boss, Franklin M. Hart, Jr., played by Dabney Coleman. The film was one of the year's top-grossing films. Tomlin starred in the 1981 science fiction comedy, <i>The Incredible Shrinking Woman</i>, a send-up of consumerism, and was the sickly heiress in the comedy, <i>All of Me</i>, opposite Steve Martin.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Tomlin and Bette Midler played two pairs of identical twins who were switched at birth in the 1988 comedy, <i>Big Business</i>. Tomlin also played chain-smoking waitress Doreen Piggott in Altman's 1993 ensemble film <i>Short Cuts</i>, based on stories by Raymond Carver. Tomlin performed in two films by director David O. Russell; she appeared as a peacenik Raku artist in <i>Flirting with Disaster</i> and later, as an existential detective in <i>I â™¥ Huckabees</i>. In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto YouTube portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names. When the <i>Miami New Times</i> asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, "I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movieâ€”even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he's a very free-form kind of guy anyway."

<p>Tomlin met her future wife, writer Jane Wagner, in March 1971. After watching the after-school TV special "J.T." written by Wagner, Tomlin invited Wagner to Los Angeles to collaborate on Tomlin's comedy LP record album <i>And That's The Truth</i>. The couple did not have a formal coming out. Tomlin said in 2006:

<td style="vertical-align: top; border: none; padding: 4px 10px;">I certainly never called a press conference or anything like that. [Back in the 1970s,] people didn't write about it. Even if they knew, they would [refer to Jane as] "Lily's collaborator," things like that. Some journalists are just motivated by their own sense of what they want to say or what they feel comfortable saying or writing about. In '77, I was on the cover of <i>Time</i>. The same week I had a big story in <i>Newsweek</i>. In one of the magazines it says I live alone, and the other magazine said I live with Jane Wagner. Unless you were so really adamantly out, and had made some declaration at some press conference, people back then didn't write about your relationship. In '75 I was making the <i>Modern Scream</i> album and Jane and I were in the studio. My publicist called me and said, "<i>Time</i> will give you the cover if you'll come out." I was more offended than anything that they thought we'd make a deal. But that was '75â€”it would have been a hard thing to do at that time.

<p>Tomlin stated in 2008, "Everybody in the industry was certainly aware of my sexuality and of Jane...in interviews, I always reference Jane and talk about Jane, but they don't always write about it."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>On December 31, 2013, Tomlin and Wagner married in a private ceremony in Los Angeles after 42 years together.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>Tomlin has been involved in a number of feminist and gay-friendly film productions, and on her 1975 album <i>Modern Scream</i> she pokes fun at straight actors who make a point of distancing themselves from their gay and lesbian charactersâ€”answering the pseudo-interview question, she replies: "How did it feel to play a heterosexual? I've seen these women all my life, I know how they walk, I know how they talk..."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>In 2013, Tomlin and Wagner worked together on the film <i>An Apology to Elephants</i>, which Wagner wrote and Tomlin narrated.
