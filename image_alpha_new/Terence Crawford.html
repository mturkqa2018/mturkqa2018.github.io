<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Stylistically, Crawford is known for his exceptionally fast hand speed, punching power and defensive skills, as well as his ability to comfortably switch hit from orthodox to southpaw.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Amateur_career">Amateur career</span></h2>
<p>Crawford took up boxing at the age of seven. He fought 70 official amateur bouts, losing only 12 times. As an amateur, he defeated future world champions Mikey Garcia and Danny GarcÃ­a. After winning three amateur tournaments shortly before the 2008 Olympics, he became the highest-ranked lightweight in the US. However, losses to boxers like Sadam Ali thwarted his Olympic ambitions.

<p>Crawford made his professional debut on March 14, 2008, knocking out Brian Cummings in round 1. He compiled a record of 19-0 with 15 wins by way of knockout against largely unheralded opposition.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Crawford had his first notable bout on the undercard of the second fight between Brandon Rios and Mike Alvarado, against former WBO lightweight champion Breidis Prescott. Prescott was originally scheduled to face WBA light welterweight champion Khabib Allakhverdiev, who withdrew with an injured elbow. Crawford was originally supposed to meet Robert Osiobe on the same card, but accepted the offer to fill in for Allakhverdiev on three-days notice. Crawford nevertheless outboxed the hard hitting Colombian and secured a unanimous decision victory. Crawford received a purse of $125,000, whilst Prescott received $50,000. This was the first time Crawford fought a 10-round fight and his first time fighting at the 140 lb. limit.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Crawford fought Alejandro Sanabria on June 15, 2013. Held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, USA, the fight served as an eliminator for the WBO world lightweight title and was also for the vacant WBO NABO lightweight title. In the 6th round, Crawford landed a devastating left hook, sending Sanabria to the canvas. Though Sanabria was able to return to his feet within the count, the fight was waved off by referee Laurence Cole, giving Crawford a TKO victory.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Klimov">Crawford vs. Klimov</span></h4>
<p>On August 21, 2013 it was announced that Crawford would fight undefeated Russian boxer and WBO #12 ranked Andrey Klimov in another elimination bout, which would see the winner challenge WBO champion Ricky Burns. The fight was scheduled for 10 rounds and took place on the undercard of Miguel Cotto vs. Delvin Rodriguez fight card on HBO at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida on October 5. Klimov was coming off a majority decision win over fringe contender John Molina Jr. in June 2013. Crawford outclassed and outpointed Klimov, handing him his first defeat as a professional in a unanimous decision win. After 10 rounds, all three judges' scored the fight 100-90 in Crawford's favour. There was lack of action as Klimov failed to impress and go in for any offence. According to CompuBox stats, Crawford landed 192 of 604 punches (32%), whilst Klimov landed just 57 of 290 (20%). In the post fight, Crawford spoke on how he went in got the job done, "I outboxed him. It was easy all night long. I thought I was hurting him all night long. I was never in any trouble and I thought he was in trouble." Due to Klimov's lack of action, it prompted a member of his team to call him a 'coward' after round 8 in the corner. Klimov began to come forward and exchange more after round 9, but had no chance of winning without a knockout.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Burns">Crawford vs. Burns</span></h4>
<p>Crawford traveled to Scotland five months later to take on 30 year old Ricky Burns for the WBO lightweight title on March 1, 2014. Hearn was pleased to bring the fight to Scotland, and admitted it was Burns' toughest fight to date. Crawford easily won the fight, boxing well on the outside and picking his shots against the over-matched but game Burns, winning his first world title. The judges' scored the fight 117-111, 116-112 and 116-112 unanimously in favour of Crawford. Burns praised Crawford after the fight, simply stating, "The better man won." Over the 12 rounds, Crawford was credited to landing 213 of 811 punches thrown (26%) but landed 41% of his power punches. Burns landed 76 of his 552 thrown (14%) and landed no more than 7 power punches per round.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Gamboa">Crawford vs. Gamboa</span></h4>
<p>Fighting for the first time as a professional in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, Crawford made his first title defense against 2004 Cuban Olympic gold medalist and former unified featherweight titleholder Yuriorkis Gamboa, who was a slight favourite going into the fight. This was only the second title fight ever held in Omaha, the first being in 1972, when heavyweight champion Joe Frazier defeated the Omaha/Council Bluffs product Ron Stander by 4th-round TKO. Gamboa entered having not fought in over a year. He was arrested in November for two misdemeanor battery charges for domestic violence and also during that span was implicated in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal that mainly engulfed Major League Baseball. The fight was announced on May 6 and took place at the CenturyLink Center on June 28, 2014. Crawford weighed in 134.8 pounds, slightly heavier than Gamboa at 134.4 pounds.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>Gamboa won the early rounds using his speed advantage, but Crawford eventually adjusted, knocking Gamboa down once in the 5th round, again in the 8th, and finally twice in the 9th to secure a TKO win in front of 10,943 screaming hometown fans. Crawford stated after the fight "I was warming up, getting used to his style in the first couple of rounds. I just wanted to test him out, I felt like I could make an adjustment with my jab, because he's always dropping his left hand. I thought I could get him with my jab in the southpaw stance." At the time of stoppage, Crawford was ahead 78-72,Â 78-72,Â 77-73Â on the judges' scorecards. In an interview in July 2016, Crawford stated that Gamboa was still his toughest fight to date.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Beltran">Crawford vs. Beltran</span></h4>
<p>Held in front of 11,127 at The CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska, Crawford made his second defense of the WBO title against <i>The Ring</i> magazine #1 contender Ray Beltran on November 29, 2014. The winner of the bout would become The Ring's lightweight champion. Crawford retained his world title earning a 12-round unanimous decision win. The final judges scorecards read 119-109 (twice) and 120-108 all in favour of Crawford. After the fight, Crawford announced his intentions to leave the lightweight division to fight as a light welterweight. The fight averaged 836,000 viewers on HBO and peaked at 936,000 viewers. It was considered a disappointment because the co-feature which saw Evgeny Gradovich draw with Jayson Velez drew an average 865,000 viewers and peaked just over 1 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Crawford was named the 2014 'Fighter of the Year' by ESPN and the Boxing Writers Association of America, after dethroning Burns and becoming lineal lightweight champion.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Light_welterweight">Light welterweight</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Dulorme">Crawford vs. Dulorme</span></h4>
<p>On March 6, 2015 ESPN reported that Crawford would debut as a light welterweight, challenging for the vacant WBO title at the College Park Center in Arlington, Texas against 25 year old Thomas Dulorme on April 18. At the press conference, Crawford told Dulorme,Â "Come prepared because I am going to be ready. [The fans] should expect a spectacular victory. This is my second world title at a different weight, and I am really going to be up for it. I will be prepared. I am always ready and prepared for any fight." The fight was stopped after Dulorme was knocked down three times in the 6th round, granting Crawford a TKO victory and the WBO title. Dulorme started off aggressive, but was unable to land much. Crawford remained defensive, picking his shots and working the distance. Referee Rafael Ramos stopped the fight at 1 minute, 51 seconds of the round. The fight averaged 1.004 million viewers on HBO.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h4><span id="Crawford_vs._Jean.2C_Lundy"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Jean,_Lundy">Crawford vs. Jean, Lundy</span></h4>
<p>Top Rank announcedÂ on August 20 that Crawford would make his first defence at CenturyLink Center, Nebraska on October 24 against Montreal based 33 year old contender Dierry Jean. Jean's only loss as professional came in 2014 against light welterweight titlist Lamont Peterson, in Peterson's hometown of Washington, D.C.. After the sole loss, Jean dropped down to lightweight where he won four fights in a row. With a dominant performance that mixed superlative boxing skills with crunching power, Crawford knocked out Jean in the 10th round to retain the WBO light welterweight title in front of 11,020 hometown fans. Crawford landed 169 total punches out of 533 thrown, and an impressive 40 percent of his power shots. Over the last three rounds, Crawford out-landed Jean 59 to 9. After the fight, Crawford stated that he was ready for former 8-division world champion Manny Pacquiao, "I'm ready. Bob [Arum], make it happen. I'm ready. I'm gonna let my handlers, (co-managers) Cameron Dunkin and Brian McIntyre, talk to Bob Arum and Team Pacquiao, and let's see if we can make it happen." Crawford was ahead on all three judges scorecards at the time of stoppage  (89-80, 90-79 twice). The fight was a success on HBO, drawing an average of 1.071 million viewers and peaked at 1.2 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>His next fight took place before a sellout crowd of 5,092 at the Theater of Madison Square Garden on February 27, 2016 against Hank Lundy. Crawford successfully defended his light welterweight championship with a fifth-round TKO of Lundy. Crawford connected with 89 of 247 punches (36%), compared to 47 of 411 for Lundy (22%). Lundy won a fast-paced first round. Crawford then overwhelmed him with head and body punches which found the mark by volume and accuracy. Lundy went down in a corner in the fifth round. He beat the count, but the bout was soon stopped by referee Steve Willis at 2 minutes, 9 seconds. Crawford spoke out about his feud with Lundy on social media, "He and I had gone back and forth on Twitter for like a year. I just wanted to shut him up for good." Crawford earned $1.21 million and Lundy earned a $150,000 purse. Although there was a lot of tension pre-fight, Lundy approached Crawford after the fight and showed respect. The fight averaged 982,000 viewers on HBO and peaked just over 1 million viewers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Postol">Crawford vs. Postol</span></h4>
<p>On May 3, 2016 it was finally confirmed that Crawford and Viktor Postol had officially signed a contract for the highly anticipated light welterweight unification fight on July 23 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Both fighters entered the ring with a matched record of 28 wins, no losses. Both men also entered the MGM Grand Garden Arena for the first time in their respective careers. Crawford won by unanimous decision and unified two light welterweight world titles before a crowd of 7,027. Crawford also claimed the vacant Lineal and The Ring Magazine titles. Crawford scored two flash knockdowns in the fifth round, on going away on all three scorecards 118-107, 118-107 and 117-108. ESPN.com also scored the fight 118-107 for Crawford. Postol resorted to rabbit punching in the 11th round. He nailed Crawford with a right hand behind the head, for which Postol was penalized one point, adding to Crawford's advantage. With the victory, Crawford staked his indisputable claim to division supremacy and set himself up for bigger fights, possibly against a returning Manny Pacquiao. Over 12 rounds, Crawford landed 141 of his 388 punches thrown (36%), and  Postol landed 83 of 244 thrown (34%).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In the post-fight, Postol praised Crawford, saying "I thought it was a good fight between two technicians, but he was quicker than me. He is one of the best fighters in the world. I just didn't have the answers for him." Crawford also praised his trainer Brian McIntyre, "Freddie Roach and Postol said that Freddie would outcoach my coach, but you tell 'em who got outcoached tonight." McIntyre revealed the plan was to keep Postol moving, which would have eliminated his jab and right hand. Crawford's purse for the fight was $1.3 million. Postol earned $675,000 for his part. Some sources stated the fight generated 50,000 PPV buys on HBO. A replay was shown later in the week and drew 378,000, also considered a weak number.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Molina">Crawford vs. Molina</span></h4>
<p>Crawford was not due to fight next until 2017, however due to the Golovkin-Jacobs fight being postponed to early 2017, this freed up the December 10 date for HBO. Arum confirmed Crawford would take the date and look at potential opponents, including the then world titleholder Eduard Troyanovsky and Antonio Orozco. Arum announced a deal was in place for a fight between Crawford and 33 year old contender John Molina Jr. on December 10, 2016 at Crawford's hometown at CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Molina previously defeated Russian contender Ruslan Provodnikov in a 12-round unanimous decision in June 2016, where he claimed the vacant WBO International light welterweight title. Molina weighed 144lb at the official weigh-in which meant he lost the right to fight for Crawford's world titles. Had Crawford lost the fight, he would have lost his belts. For the fight to go ahead, Molina gave $400,000 of his purse to Crawford, adding to his already agreed purse of $1.5m.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Crawford held onto his titles in stopping Molina in the 8th round in front of a large home crowd in Omaha. Crawford moved around the ring most of the fight, jabbing, holding and pot shotting an out of shape Molina. In round 8, Crawford threw a flurry of shots that hurt Molina. Crawford then hit Molina with three right hands to the head and a right to the body, at which point referee Mark Nelson halted the fight. In the post fight interview, Crawford felt he should be the 2016 'Fighter of the Year' for his wins over Molina, Hank Lundy and Viktor Postol, "I feel like I got it. I just have to wait until the results come in." Crawford also reiterated his desire to unify the division before a possible move up to welterweight. Crawford landed 184 punches from 419 thrown, Molina landed 41 of 287 thrown, a 14-percent connect rate. The fight drew an average 806,000 viewers and peaked at 871,000 viewers on HBO.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Diaz">Crawford vs. Diaz</span></h4>
<p>Bob Arum spoke to ESPN in early February 2017 about Crawford's next defence and possible opponents. He said that HBO had set a May 20 date for the fight and the venue would most likely be in Crawford's hometown, Omaha. Mexican boxer Antonio Orozco, one of Crawford's mandatory challengers and 2008 Olympics light welterweight gold medalist Felix Diaz, who had been calling out Crawford, were the names mentioned. He went on to explain how Orozco's promoters seemed to have little interest in the fight. Lou DiBella, promoter of Diaz, was eager to make a fight happen. Arum spoke to The Ring on March 1 saying that Crawford's opponent had been narrowed down to Felix Diaz or Adrian Granados. Amir Imam, ranked number 1 by WBC at 140 was also in the mix, but Arum said that he found it difficult to make a deal with his promoter, Don King. Terms were finally agreed on March 22 for Crawford vs. Diaz at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on May 20. Contracts were to be signed shortly after. A week after the fight was announced, the location was changed. The new venue was confirmed to be Madison Square Garden in New York. This was the first time Crawford fought at the arena.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In front of a crowd of 8,026, Crawford retained his world titles after a dominating performance, which forced Diaz's trainer, Joel Diaz to stop the fight after round 10. Towards the end, Diaz did close to nothing, leaning against the ropes. This was mostly due to his vision, as his right eye was nearly closed and his left eye was also badly swollen. Crawford used his jab for most of the fight, and used it to control the pace and help him move around the ring in his southpaw stance. Joel Diaz said in the post-fight that he had pulled his fighter out because he was taking too much punishment. Also in the post-fight, Crawford said, "It's not up to me. But everybody wants to know who's the next guy that Terence Crawford wants to fight. I'll fight anybody. It doesn't matter who it is." He then called out Keith Thurman. Promoter Bob Arum mentioned Crawford would likely fight again in the summer, against Julius Indongo, where the winner would be crowned the undisputed world champion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>According to CompuBox punch stats, Crawford landed 93 of his 250 punches thrown (37.1%). In that figure, he landed 59.1% of his power punches (139 of 235 thrown). Diaz landed 69 of 346 (19.9%). At the time of stoppage, judges Glenn Feldman and Steve Weisfeld had it 100-90 and judge Julie Lederman had the score 99-91, all in favour of Crawford. According to Nielsen, the fight averaged 961,000 viewers on HBO's â€œWorld Championship Boxingâ€ and peaked at 1.036m viewers. It was the most viewed fight on HBO so far in 2017.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Indongo">Crawford vs. Indongo</span></h4>
<p>On July 1, 2017 Top Rank announced that a light welterweight unification fight between Crawford, and WBA (Unified) and IBF champion Julius Indongo was agreed upon to take place on August 19 at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska live on ESPN in US and Sky Sports in the UK. The projected unification of every major world title in boxing (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO, <i>The Ring</i>, and lineal) will determine the light welterweight division's first undisputed champion since Kostya Tszyu in 2004, and the first time all the aforementioned titles have been at stake in a single fight since Bernard Hopkins vs. Jermain Taylor in 2005. Both fighters paid over $100,000 US dollars in sanctioning fees. Crawford entered the fight as a heavy favourite to win.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In front of a home crowd of 12,121, Crawford became the undisputed champion at light welterweight after knocking out Indongo in round 3. The final punch was a well placed left hook to the right side of the body, which immediately dropped Indongo. Referee Jack Reiss counted to 10 and promptly called an end after 1 minute and 38 seconds. Indongo also touched the canvas during round 1, but the referee ruled it a slip. Additionally, Indongo was knocked down and received a count after a left hand from Crawford during round 2.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>According to CompuBox stats, Crawford landed 26 of his 75 punches thrown (35%), while Indongo landed 13 of 74 thrown (18%). Both boxers earned an undisclosed 7-figure purse. Following the fight, Indongo stated "When he hit me like that, my mind was gone" about Crawford's body shot. Crawford stated that he had yet to make a decision on the next step in his career but there was speculation about him moving up to the welterweight division or defending his light welterweight titles against Mikey Garcia. The card averaged 965,000 viewers on ESPN.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>Mere days after the fight, the IBF ordered a fight between Crawford and their mandatory challenger, Sergey Lipinets. Lipinets was named Indongo's mandatory challenger on December 2016, but Indongo was given an exception to allow the unification fight with Crawford to happen. Lipinets stated that the IBF title was "stolen from him". As Crawford didn't plan to return to the ring before the IBF's deadline, he vacated the IBF title just 11 days after defeating Indongo. The IBF ordered Lipinets to face Akihiro Kondo for their vacant title.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>On August 31, the WBA Championships Committee revealed that they had elevated Crawford to 'Super' champion. Article C18 of the WBA's rules stated that as Crawford holds all major titles at light welterweight, he could be elevated and deemed a 'Super' champion. The WBA, however, claimed to hold on to their policy of having only one champion per weight category and insisted an interim or regular title would not be created.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Welterweight">Welterweight</span></h3>
<p>On October 26, 2017 Crawford officially vacated his WBO title to move up to the welterweight division, The WBO announced Crawford as the mandatory challenger to their titleholder Jeff Horn. With Horn scheduled to make a voluntary defence in December 2017 against British boxer Gary Corcoran, Crawford would not fight again in 2017. The winner of Horn vs. Cocoran was then ordered to schedule a fight against Crawford within 90 days. Arum stated he had dates in March and April 2018 on hold.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Horn">Crawford vs. Horn</span></h4>
<p>When Horn successfully made a voluntary defence of his WBO welterweight title by stopping Gary Corcoran, this set up the fight between Crawford and Horn. Following his win, Horn was challenged to a big money fight at light middleweight by 42 year old Anthony Mundine, before eventually defending his WBO title against Crawford. Horn admitted his interest in the fight where he would be seeing a purse of around $2 million with his trainer, Glenn Rushton, also very much interested in the Mundine fight. On January 10, 2018 it was confirmed that all terms had been agreed upon for Horn to defend the WBO title in a mandatory defence against Crawford, after renegotiating the purses. The fight was being slated for April 21, 2018 at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. On January 17, Arum stated the fight would likely take place at Madison Square Garden as there was no availability in Las Vegas for the dates required. In February, Arum claimed that due to other boxing events taking place around New York in April, the Crawford vs. Horn bout would take place in Las Vegas instead.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>On March 14, it was reported that the fight would be postponed after Crawford suffered a hand injury whilst sparring. The fight was rescheduled to take place on June 9 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. It was reported on May 24 that Horn had been involved in a car accident, involving three cars in Brisbane, however Horn himself confirmed that he was not hurt and did not suffer any injuries. Speaking to a newspaper, he said, "No one was badly hurt but it stunned me. Fortunately I was in the car alone and my wife Jo and baby Isabelle were home. The accident was a shock but nothing is going to derail me from beating Terence Crawford. Iâ€™m very fit. I feel Iâ€™m going to peak right at fight time."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Crawford became a three-weight world champion in front of 8,112 fans in attendance after he eventually stopped Horn via technical knockout in round 9. At the time of the stoppage, all three judges had Crawford winning all the previous rounds. Horn lacked defense but kept coming forward, trying to look for an opening. Horn made the opening two rounds the most competitive with his aggressive style but Crawford adapted and remained the busier fighter throughout, landing the most telling shots of the bout. Horn was eventually dropped for the first time in round 9 with an overhand left. After he got back up, Crawford landed a series of hard shots that caused referee Robert Byrd to stop the fight. The official time of the stoppage was 2 minutes and 33 seconds. After the bout, Crawford spoke about his welterweight debut, "Like I told you all before, I'm strong. I was way stronger than him. You all kept telling me how strong he was, so I had to go and show you. I just had to get in the ring and prove it. You saw what I did in there. My power carried up, my physicality. Now I want all the champions at welterweight." Promoter Bob Arum highly praised Crawford and compared him to Sugar Ray Leonard. According to CompuBox stats, Crawford landed 155 of 367 of punches thrown (42%). This included 47 power shots landed over the final two rounds. Horn, on the other hand, landed just 58 of 257 punches thrown (23%). Crawford earned a career-high $3 million purse and Horn also earned a career-high purse of $1.75 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Benavidez">Crawford vs. Benavidez</span></h4>
<p>Crawford's first defense of the WBO title was slated to take place on October 13, 2018. Early reports stated his likely opponent would be former WBA Interim light welterweight champion JosÃ© Benavidez (27-0, 18 KOs). On September 6, despite having two years left of his contract, Crawford signed a new multi-year deal with Top Rank. On signing the extension, Crawford said, "I am the best fighter in the world, hands down. ESPN is the biggest brand in sports and Top Rank is the biggest promotional company in boxing. This was a no-brainer for me and my team. All of the super fights that the world wants to see will happen. Like I've said before, I want all of the champions in the welterweight division." The fight against Benavidez was also announced by Top Rank to take place at the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>In front of 13,323 in attendance, the largest crowd he had drawn to date, Crawford came on strong in the final round to score a round 12 knockout win Benavidez to retain his WBO welterweight title. The fight was halted at 2 minutes and 42 seconds of round 12. Crawford used an in and out style of fighting to land his shots, and then got away before Benavidez could hit him. Towards the end of round 12, Crawford knocked down Benavidez, who fought with an injured knee, with a left-right combination, the final punch being a right uppercut. After Benavidez got back to his feet, Crawford landed a flurry of punches until referee Celestino Ruiz stepped in. At this stage, Benavidez was too tired and hurt to stop the onslaught. Crawford landed head and body combinations earlier in the fight which forced Benavidez to take a step back. Crawford credited the body shots, saying, "That takes something out of you every time. That's what slowed him down. You could tell every time he was shaking his head. I knew it would take its toll in the later rounds." At the time of stoppage, Crawford was ahead 110-99, 108-101 and 107-102 on all three judges scorecards. According to Compubox, Crawford landed 186 of 579 punches thrown (32%) and Benavidez landed 92 of his 501 thrown (18%). Benavidez landed 8 punches per round. Compubox Historical showed that Crawford's previous 10 opponents landed only 7 per round. Crawford earned $3.625 million, his career-highest, compared to Benavidez's $500,000 purse. The near two-hour telecast averaged 2,245,000 viewers on ESPN.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crawford_vs._Khan">Crawford vs. Khan</span></h4>
<p>On November 16, two-time Lithuanian Olympian Egidijus Kavaliauskas knocked out Roberto Arriaza in the third round of their bout. After the fight, Arum hinted Kavaliauskas would likely challenge Crawford for the WBO welterweight title in early 2019. Kavaliauskas stated he wanted to fight the best in the division and called out Crawford. A week later, it was reported 37 year old, former world champion Luis Collazo (38-7, 20 KOs) was in line to challenge for Crawford, in what would be Crawford's first of three bouts in 2019. The fight would main event a Top Rank card on ESPN on March 23, 2019 at Madison Square Garden in New York. Prior to pursuing the fight with Collazo, Carl Moretti told Ringtv they offered Danny GarcÃ­a a guaranteed $3 million purse to fight Crawford on the same date on ESPN PPV, which would have included a share of the revenue generated. The offer was made to Angel GarcÃ­a, who told Moretti he would discuss the offer with Danny, but ultimately never replied to Top Rank's offer. According to Moretti, the offer was made two weeks before GarcÃ­a's fight with AdriÃ¡n Granados was announced.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>Although Collazo had agreed the terms to fight, Crawford was yet to sign the agreement. On December 3, it was reported that Top Rank had offered former unified light welterweight champion Amir Khan a guaranteed $5 million purse, plus a percentage of PPV revenue, to fight Crawford on March 23, 2019. Khan explained how he was considering the fight as it would be a good pay day and for the WBO welterweight title. He stated the fight with Kell Brook, who he was in negotiations with over a big domestic showdown, could still take place at a later date. On January 4, 2019 with no opponent announced, Crawford's scheduled return to the ring was pushed back to April 20, 2019. A few hours after, it was reported that Khan accepted Top Rank's offer to fight Crawford on April 20. A press conference was set for January 15, in London and the fight was made official to take place on ESPN PPV on April 20, 2019. Khan admitted it was a hard decision to make when choosing to fight Crawford over long-time rival Brook, as a bout with Crawford would see his legacy enhanced further. Khan also believed winning another world title against a consensus P4P boxer would be a bigger achievement than defeating Brook. Khan also revealed he would return to veteran trainer Virgil Hunter for the Crawford bout. Hunter was unable to train Khan for his previous two bouts due a health scare. After the pressers concluded, New York's Madison Square Garden was chosen as the venue for the bout. BT Sport in the UK picked up the event, announcing it would take place on their PPV platform. <br/>
The match took place on 20 April 2019, and ended in round 6 with a TKO in favor of Crawford.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Outside_of_boxing">Outside of boxing</span></h2>
<p>On September 21, 2016 Crawford was found guilty of two counts dating back to April, when he turned himself into the police. He was charged for theft of services, criminal mischief, third-degree assault and trespassing. The assault and theft charges were later dropped. A sentence hearing date was set for December 15. The incident took place at a local car body shop. Crawford had made a partial payment, but refused to pay the remainder after he wasn't satisfied with the work being done and amount being charged. He started to lower the car himself, damaging the hydraulic lift. At the hearing, Crawford was sentenced to 90 days in jail, but would be serving 53 days. Crawford was incarcerated for only 8 hours, before being released after his attorney posted a $10,000 bond.
