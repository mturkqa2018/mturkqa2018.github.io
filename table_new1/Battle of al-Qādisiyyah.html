<p>The <b>Battle of al-QÄdisiyyah</b> (Arabic: <span dir="rtl" lang="ar">Ù…Ø¹Ø±ÙƒØ© Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø§Ø¯Ø³ÙŠÙ‘Ø©</span>â€Ž; romanization <i>MaÊ»rakatu al-QÄdisiyyah</i>; alternative spellings: Qadisiyya, Qadisiyyah, Kadisiya, Ghadesiyeh), fought in 636, was a decisive battle between the Arab Muslim army and the army of the Sasanian Empire during the first period of Muslim conquests.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Although the description of this battle has had an important place in Islamic historiography, much of the material have little historical value. The battle took place at an uncertain date at the small frontier town of Qadisiyyah. The larger Sasanian army was headed by the important military and political figure Rostam Farrokhzad, who died in uncertain circumstances, and a collapse of the Sasanian army led to an Arab Muslim victory.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The Muslim victory was key to the conquest of Asorestan (Iraq), and was followed by the major engagements at Jalula and Nahavand. The battle also saw the alleged alliance of Emperor Yazdegerd III with Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who married his granddaughter Manyanh to Yazdegerd as a symbol of alliance.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Fall of the Sasanian Empire</div>
<p>During the lifetime of Muhammad, the Sasanian Empire was ruled by Khosrow II. The Byzantineâ€“Sasanian War of 602â€“628 began as an attempt to avenged the murder Khosrow's ally, Byzantine emperor Maurice, by a pretender, Emperor Phocas. The military of the Sasanian Empire invaded and captured Syria, Egypt, and Anatolia, and the True Cross was carried away in triumph.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Emperor Heraclius succeeded Phocas in 610 and led the Byzantines in a war of reconquest, successfully regaining territory lost to the Sasanians. He defeated a small Persian army at the final Battle of Nineveh and advanced towards Ctesiphon. After a successful coup by one of Khosrow's sons, Kavadh II, the new ruler ordered the execution of his father along with all his brothers and half-brothers, which included Mardanshah, the favorite son of Khosrow II, who was heir to the Sasanian throne. Kavadh's next move was to make peace with the Byzantines and return all captured territories.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>At the same time Turks had attacked the north of Persia with a massive army. Heraclius ordered his armies to retreat after a pact was signed with Kavadh. According to the pact, the True Cross would be given back to Heraclius, and all Byzantine territory that the Persians had captured would be evacuated.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internal_conflicts_of_succession">Internal conflicts of succession</span></h3>
<p>Khosrow II was murdered in his palace by his son Kavadh II in 628. Kavadh II put his 18 brothers to death and began negotiations with Heraclius, but he died suddenly after a reign of only a few months after being infected by plague. Thus began a civil war. Ardashir III (c. 621â€“630), son of Kavadh II, was raised to the throne at age seven but was killed 18 months later by his general Farrokhan, who was called Shahrbaraz, a title meaning "the Boar of the Empire". Shahrbaraz declared himself ruler. Shahrbaraz had taken Damascus and Jerusalem from the Byzantine Empire in 613 and 614 respectively.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>On 9 June 629, Shahrbaraz was killed during an invasion from Armenia by a Khazarâ€“GÃ¶ktÃ¼rk force under Chorpan Tarkhan. He was succeeded by Boran, daughter of Khosrow II. She was the 26th sovereign monarch of Persia, ruling from 17 June 629 to 16 June 630, and was one of only two women to sit on the Sasanian throne, the other being her sister Azarmidokht. She was made empress regnant on the understanding that she would vacate the throne upon Yazdegerd III attaining majority.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia</div>
<p>After the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr established control over Arabia through the Ridda Wars and then launched campaigns against the remaining Arabs of Syria and Palestine. He triggered the chain of events which would in few decades form one of the largest empires the world had ever seen. He thus put the nascent Islamic empire on a collision course with the Byzantine and Sassanid empires, which were the two super-powers of the time. The wars soon became a matter of conquest that would eventually result in the demise of the Sassanid empire and the annexation of all of the Byzantine Empire's southern and eastern territory. To make victory certain, Abu Bakr decided that the invading army would consist entirely of volunteers and would be commanded by his best general, Khalid ibn al-Walid. Khalid won quick victories in four consecutive battles: the Battle of Chains, fought in April 633; the Battle of River, fought in the third week of April 633; the Battle of Walaja, fought in May 633; followed by the decisive Battle of Ullais, fought in mid-May, 633. By now the Persian Empire was struggling, and in the last week of May 633, the capital city of Iraq, Al-Hirah, fell to the Muslims after the Battle of Hira. Thereafter, the Siege of Al-Anbar during Juneâ€“July 633 resulted in surrender of the city after strong resistance. Khalid then moved towards the south and conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr after the Battle of Ayn al-Tamr in the last week of July 633. In November 633, the Persian counter-attack was repulsed by Khalid. In December 633, Muslim forces reached the border city of Firaz, where Khalid defeated the combined Sassanid, Byzantine, and Christian Arab armies in the Battle of Firaz. This was the last battle in the conquest of Iraq.

<p>By this time, with the exception of Ctesiphon, Khalid had captured all of Iraq. However, circumstances changed on the western front. The Byzantine army soon came in direct conflict in Syria and Palestine, and Khalid was sent with half of his army to deal with this new development. Soon after, Caliph Abu Bakr died in August 634 and was succeeded by Caliph Umar ibn al-KhattÄb. Muslim forces in Iraq were too few to control the region. After the devastating invasion by Khalid, the Persians took time to recover; political instability was at its peak at Ctesiphon. Once the Persians recovered, they concentrated more troops and mounted a counterattack. Muthanna ibn Harith, who was now commander-in-chief of the Muslim forces in Iraq, pulled his troops back from all outposts and evacuated Al-Hirah. He then retreated to the region near the Arabian Desert. Meanwhile, Umar sent reinforcements from Madinah under the command of Abu Ubaid. The reinforcements reached Iraq in October 634, and Abu Ubaid assumed the command of the army and defeated the Sassanids at the Battle of Namaraq near modern-day Kufa. Then, in the Battle of Kaskar, he recaptured Hira.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>The Persians launched another counterattack and defeated the Muslims at Battle of the Bridge, which killed Abu Ubaid, and the Muslims suffered heavy losses. Muthanna then assumed command of the army and withdrew the remnant of his forces, about 3000 strong, across the Euphrates. The Persian commander Bahman (also known as Dhu al-Hajib) was committed to driving the Muslims away from Persian soil but was restrained from pursuing the defeated Muslims after being called back by Rustum to Ctesiphon to help in putting down the revolt against him. Muthanna retreated near the frontier of Arabia and called for reinforcements. After getting sufficient reinforcements, he re-entered the fray and camped at the western bank of Euphrates, where a Persian force intercepted him and was defeated.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Persian_counter-attack">Persian counter-attack</span></h2>
<p>After Khalid left Iraq for Syria, Suwad, the fertile area between the Euphrates and the Tigris, remained unstable. Sometimes it was occupied by the Persians and sometimes by the Muslims. This "tit-for-tat" struggle continued until emperor Yazdegerd III consolidated his power and sought alliance with Heraclius in 635 in an effort to prepare for a massive counterattack. Heraclius married his daughter to Yazdegerd III, in accordance with Roman tradition to seal an alliance. Heraclius then prepared for a major offensive in the Levant. Meanwhile, Yazdegerd ordered a concentration of massive armies to reclaim Iraq for good. This was supposed to be a well-coordinated attack by both emperors to annihilate the power of their common enemy, Caliph Umar.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate on time, so the plan was not carried out as planned. Meanwhile, Umar allegedly had knowledge of this alliance and devised his own plan to counteract it. He wanted to finish the Byzantines first, and later deal with the Persians separately. Accordingly, he sent 6000 soldiers as reinforcements to his army in Yarmouk who were facing off the Byzantine army. Simultaneously, Umar engaged Yazdegerd III, ordering Saad ibn Abi Waqqas to enter in peace negotiations with him by inviting him to convert to Islam. Heraclius, fearing the abovementioned scenario had instructed his general Vahan not to engage in battle with Muslims and await his orders. However, Vahan, witnessing fresh reinforcements for the Muslims arriving daily from Madinah, felt compelled to attack the Muslim forces before they got too strong. Heraclius's imperial army was annihilated at Battle of Yarmouk in August 636, three months before the battle of Qadisiyyah,  therefore ending the Roman Emperor's offensive in the west. Undeterred, Yazdegerd continued to execute his plan of attack and concentrated armies near his capital Ctesiphon. A large force was put under the control of veteran general Rostam and was cantoned at Valashabad near Ctesiphon. Receiving news of preparations for a massive counter-attack, Umar ordered Muthana to abandon Iraq and retreat to the edge of the Arabian Desert. The Iraqi campaign would be addressed at a later date.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Muslim_battle_preparation">Muslim battle preparation</span></h2>
<p>Caliph Umar started raising new armies from all over Arabia with the intention of re-invading Iraq. Umar appointed Sa`d ibn AbÄ« WaqqÄs, an important member of the Quraysh tribe  as commander of this army. In May 636, Saad was instructed to march to Northern Arabia with a contingent of 4,000 men from his camp at Sisra (near Madinah) and take over command of the Muslim army, and immediately march onwards to Iraq. Because of his inexperience as a general, he was instructed by Caliph Umar to seek the advice of experienced commanders before making critical decisions. Umar sent orders to him to halt at Al-Qadisiyyah, a small town 30 miles from Kufah.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Umar continued to remotely issue strategic orders and commands to his army throughout the campaign. Due to a shortage of manpower, Umar decided to lift the ban on the ex-apostate tribes of Arabia from participating in state affairs. The army raised was not professional but was a volunteer force composed of newly recruited contingents from all over Arabia. After a decisive victory against the Byzantine army at the Yarmouk, Umar sent immediate orders to Abu Ubaidah to send a contingent of veterans to Iraq. A force of 5,000 veterans of Yarmouk were also sent to Qadisiyyah, they arrived on the second day of the battle Qadisiyyah. This proved to be a major turning point, and a major morale booster for the Muslim army. The battle of Qadissiyyah was fought predominantly between Umar and Rostam, rather than between Saad and Rostam. Coincidentally, bulk of the Sassanid army was also made up of new recruits since the bulk of regular Sassanid forces was destroyed during the Battle of Walaja and the Ullais.

<p>Modern estimates suggest that the size of Sassanid forces was about 50,000â€“100,000 strong and Muslims around 30,000 strong after being reinforced by the Syrian contingent on second day of the battle. These figures come from studying the logistical capabilities of the combatants, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting the Sassanids and Arabs. Most scholars, however, agree that the Sassanid army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a sizable margin.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sassanid_Persia">Sassanid Persia</span></h3>
<p>The Persian army reached Qadisiyyah in July 636 and established their highly fortified camps on the eastern bank of the Ateeq river. There was a strong bridge over the Ateeq river, the only crossing to the main Sassanid camps, although they had boats available in reserve to cross the river.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>The Sassanid Persian army, about 60,000 strong, fell into three main categories, infantry, heavy cavalry, and the Elephant corps. The Elephant corps was also known as the Indian corps, for the elephants were trained and brought from Persian provinces in India. On 16 November 636, the Sassanid army crossed over the west bank of Ateeq, and Rostam deployed his 45,000 infantry in four divisions, each about 150 meters apart from the other. 15,000 cavalry were divided among four divisions to be used as reserve for counter-attack and offensives. At Qadisiyyah, about 33 elephants were present, eight with each of the four divisions of army. The battle front was about 4Â km long.
The Sassanid Persians' right wing was commanded by Hormuzan, the right center by Jalinus, the rear guard by Piruzan, and the left wing by Mihran. Rostam himself was stationed at an elevated seat, shaded by a canopy, near the west bank of the river and behind the right center, where he enjoyed a wide view of the battlefield. By his side waved the <i>Derafsh-e-KÄveyÄn</i> (in Persian: Ø¯Ø±ÙØ´ Ú©Ø§ÙˆÛŒØ§Ù†, the 'flag of KÄveh'), the standard of the Sassanid Persians. Rostam placed men at certain intervals between the battlefield and the Sassanid capital, Ctesiphon, to transmit information.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rashidun">Rashidun</span></h3>
<p>In July 636, the main Muslim army marched from Sharaf to Qadisiyya. After establishing camp, organizing defenses, and securing river heads, Saad sent parties inside  Suwad to conduct raids. Saad was continuously in contact with Caliph Umar, to whom he sent a detailed report of the geographical features of the land where the Muslims encamped and the land between Qaddasiyyah, Madinah, and the region where the Persians were concentrating their forces.
The Muslim army at this point was about 30,000 strong, including 7,000 cavalry. Its strength rose to 36,000 strong once it was reinforced by the contingent from Syria and local Arabs allies. Saad was suffering from sciatica, and had boils all over his body. He took a seat in the old royal palace at Qaddasiyyah from where he directed the war operations and had a good view of the battlefield. He appointed as his deputy Khalid ibn Arfatah, who carried out his instructions to the battlefield. The Rashidun infantry was deployed in four corps, each with its own cavalry regiment stationed at the rear for counter-attacks. Each corps was positioned about 150 meters from the other. The army was formed on a tribal and clan basis, so that every man fought next to well-known comrades and so that tribes were held accountable for any weakness.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Weaponry">Weaponry</span></h4>
<p>The Muslim forces wore gilded helmets similar to the silver helmets of the Sassanid soldiers. Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck, and cheeks, either as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armor included hardened leather scale or lamellar armour and mail. Infantry soldiers were more heavily armored than the horsemen. Hauberks and large wooden or wickerwork shields were used as well as long-shafted spears. Infantry spears were about 2.5 meters long and those of the cavalry were up to 5.5 meters long.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Swords used were a short infantry weapon like the Roman gladius and the Sassanid long sword. Both were worn hung from a baldric. Bows were about two meters long when unbraced, about the same size as the famous English longbow, with a maximum range of about 150 meters. Early Muslim archers were infantry archers who proved very effective against the opposing cavalry. The troops at the Sassanid Persian front were lightly armored compared to the Rashidun troops deployed at the Byzantine front.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_battle">The battle</span></h2>
<p>The Arabs were camped at Qadisiyyah with 30,000 men since July 636. Umar ordered Saad to send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and the general of Sasanian army Rostam Farrokhzad, inviting them to convert to Islam. For the next three months, negotiations between Arabs and Persians continued. On Caliph Umar's instructions, Saad sent an embassy to court of Persia with instructions to convert the Sassanid emperor to Islam or to get him to agree to paying jizyah. An-Numan ibn Muqarrin led the Muslim emissary to Ctesiphon and met Sasanian Emperor Yazdgerd III, but the mission failed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p>

<p>During one meeting, Yazdgerd III, intent on humiliating the Arabs, ordered his servants to place a basket full of earth on the head of Asim ibn Amr, a member of the emissary. The optimistic Arab ambassador interpreted this gesture with the following words: "Congratulations! The enemy has voluntarily surrendered its territory to us" (referring to the earth in the basket). Rustam, the Persian general, held a view similar to Asim ibn Amir. He allegedly rebuked Yazdgerd III for the basket of earth because it signifies that the Persian voluntarily surrendered their land to the Muslims. Yazdgerd III, upon hearing this, ordered soldiers to pursue the Muslim emissaries; and retrieve the basket, however the emissaries were already at their base camp at that point.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>As tensions eased on the Syrian front, Caliph Umar instructed negotiations to be halted. This was an open signal to the Persians to prepare for battle. Rostam FarrokhzÄd, who was at Valashabad, broke camp for Qadisiyyah. He was inclined, however, to avoid fighting and once more opened peace negotiations. Saad sent Rabi bin Amir and later Mughirah bin Zurarah to hold talks. After the negotiations fell through, both sides prepared for battle.

<p>On 16 November 636, an intervening canal was choked up and converted into a road on Rostam's orders and before dawn the entire Persian army crossed the canal. Rostam now armed himself with a double set of complete armour and requisite weapons. Both armies stood face to face about 500 meters apart. Rashidun's army was deployed facing northeast, while the Sassanid army was deployed facing southwest and had the river at its rear

<p>The battle began with personal duels; Muslim Mubarizun stepped forward and many were slain on both sides. Muslim chronicles record several heroic duels between the Sassanid and Muslim champions. The purpose of these duels was to lower the morale of the opposing army by killing as many champions as possible. Having lost several in duels, Rostam began the battle by ordering his left wing to attack the Muslims' right wing.

<p>The Persian attack began with heavy showers of arrows, which caused considerable damage to the Muslims' right wing. Elephants led the charge from the Persian side. Abdullah ibn Al-mutim, the Muslim commander of right wing ordered Jareer ibn Abdullah (cavalry commander of the right wing) to deal with the Sassanid elephants. However, Jareer's cavalry was stopped by the Sassanid heavy cavalry. The elephants continued to advance, and the Muslim infantry began to fall back.

<p>Saad sent orders to Ath'ath ibn Qais, commander of the center right cavalry to check the Sassanid cavalry advance. Athâ€™ath then led a cavalry regiment that reinforced the right wing cavalry and launched a counterattack at the flank of the Sassanid left wing. Meanwhile, Saad sent orders to Zuhra ibn Al-Hawiyya, commander of Muslims right center, to dispatch an infantry regiment to reinforce the infantry of the right wing. An infantry regiment was sent under Hammal ibn Malik that helped the right wing infantry launch a counterattack against the Sassanids. The Sassanid left wing retreated under the frontal attack by infantry of Muslims right wing reinforced by infantry regiment from right center and flanking attack by Muslims cavalry reinforced by a cavalry regiment from right center.

<p>With his initial attacks repulsed, Rostam ordered his right center and right wing to advance against the Muslim Cavalry. The Muslim left wing and left center were first subjected to intense archery, followed by a charge of the Sassanid right wing and right center. Once again, the Elephant corps led the charge. The Muslim cavalry, on left wing and left center, already in panic due to the charge of the elephants, were driven back by the combined action of Sassanid heavy cavalry and the elephants.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Saad sent word to Asim ibn Amr, commander of the left center, to overpower the elephants. Asim's strategy was to overcome the archers on the elephants' and cut the girths of the saddles. Asim ordered his archers to kill the men on elephants and ordered infantry to cut the girths of the saddles. The tactic worked, as the Persians retired the elephants, the Muslims counterattacked. The Sassanid army's center right retreated followed by the retreat of the entire right wing. By afternoon the Persian attacks on the Muslim left wing and left center were also beaten back. Saad, in order to exploit this opportunity, ordered a yet another counterattack. The Muslim cavalry then charged from the flanks with full force, a tactic known as <i>Karr wa farr</i>. The Muslim attacks were eventually repulsed by Rostam, who plunged into the fray personally and is said to have received several wounds. The fighting ended at dusk. The battle was inconclusive, with considerable losses on both sides.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>In the Muslim chronicles, the first day of the battle of Qadisiyyah is known as <i>Yawm al-Armath</i> (ÙŠÙˆÙ… Ø£Ø±Ù…Ø§Ø«) or "The Day of Disorder".

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_2">Day 2</span></h3>
<p>On 17 November, like the previous day, Saad decided to start the day with Mubarizuns to inflict maximum morale damage on the Persians. At noon, while these duelings were still going on, reinforcements from Syria arrived for the Muslim army. First, an advance guard under Al-Qa'qa ibn Amr at-Tamimi arrived, followed by the main army under its commander Hisham ibn Utbah, nephew of Saad. Qaâ€™qa divided his advance guard into several small groups and instructed them to reach the battlefield one after the other giving the impression that a very large reinforcement contingent had arrived. This strategy had a very demoralizing effect the Persian army.

<p>On this day, Qaâ€™qa is said to have killed Persian general Bahman, who had commanded the Sassanid army at the Battle of Bridge earlier.
As there were no elephants in the Sassanid fighting force that day, Saad sought to exploit this opportunity to gain any breakthrough if possible, so he ordered a general attack. All four Muslim corps surged forward, but the Sassanids stood firm and repulsed repeated attacks. During these charges, Qaâ€™qa resorted to the ingenious device of camouflaging camels to look like strange monsters. These monsters moved to the Sassanid front; seeing them, the Sassanid horses turned and bolted. The disorganization of the Sassanid cavalry left their left center infantry vulnerable. Saad ordered the Muslims to intensify the attack. Qaâ€™qa ibn Amr, now acting as a field commander of the Muslim army, planned to kill the Sassanid commander Rostam, and led a group of Mubarizuns, from his Syrian contingent who were also the veterans of Battle of Yarmouk, through the Sassanids' right center towards Rostam's headquarter. Rostam again personally led a counterattack against the Muslims, but no breakthrough could be achieved. At dusk, the two armies pulled back to their camps.

<p>On 18 November, Rostam wanted a quick victory, before more Muslim reinforcements could arrive.
The Elephant corps was once again in the front of the Sassanid army, giving him the advantage. Pressing this advantage, Rostam ordered a general attack along the Muslim front, using his full force. All four Sassanid corps moved forward and struck the Muslims on their front. The Persian attack began with the customary volley of arrows and projectiles. The Muslims sustained heavy losses before their archers retaliated. The Persian elephant corps once again led the charge, supported by their infantry and cavalry. At the approach of the Sassanid elephants, the Muslim riders once again became unnerved, leading to confusion in the Muslim ranks. The Sassanids pressed the attack, and the Muslims fell back.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Through the gaps that had appeared in the foe's ranks as a result of the Sassanid advance, Rostam sent a cavalry regiment to capture the old palace where Saad the Commander-in-Chief of the Muslim forces was stationed. The strategy of Rostam was that the Muslim Commander-in-Chief should be killed or taken captive with a view to demoralizing the Muslims. However, a strong cavalry contingent of the Muslims rushed to the spot and drove away the Sassanid cavalry.

<p>Saad determined that there was only one way to win the battle: to destroy the Sassanid elephant corps that was causing the greatest havoc among the Muslim ranks. He issued the orders that the elephants should be overpowered by blinding them and severing their trunks. After a long struggle, the Muslims finally succeeded in mutilating the elephants sufficiently to be driven off. The frightened elephant corps rushed through the Sassanid ranks and made for the river. By noon no elephants were left on the battlefield. The flight of the elephants caused considerable confusion in the Sassanid ranks. To exploit this situation even further, Saad ordered a general attack, and the two armies clashed once again. In spite of the Muslims' repeated charges, the Sassanids held their ground. In the absence of the Persian  elephants, the Muslims once again brought up camels camouflaged as monsters. The trick did not work this time, and the Persian horses stood their ground.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>The third day of the battle was the hardest for both armies. There were heavy casualties on both sides, and the battlefield was strewn with the dead bodies of fallen warriors. In spite of fatigue after three days of battle, the armies continued the fight, which raged through the night and ending only with the dawn. It became a battle of stamina, with both sides on the verge of breaking. The strategy of Sa'd was to wear down the Persians and snatch victory from them. In the Muslim chronicles the third day of the Battle is known as <i>Yaum-ul-Amas</i> and the night as Lailat-ul-Harir, meaning the "Night of Rumbling Noises".

<p>At sunrise of 19 November 636, the fighting had ceased, but the battle was still inconclusive. Qa'qa, with the consent of Sa'd, was now acting as a field commander of the Muslim troops. He is reported to have addressed his men as follows:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The Muslims' left center led by Qaâ€™qa surged forward and attacked the Sassanid right center, followed by the general attack of the Muslims' corps. The Sassanids were taken by surprise at the resumption of battle. The Sassanids left wing and left center were pushed back. Qaâ€™qa again led a group of Mubarizuns against the Sassanids' left center and by noon, he and his men were able to pierce through the Sassanid center.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Final_battle">Final battle</span></h3>
<p>On the final day, Rostam was slain, which heralded the defeat of the Persians. Two different accounts have been told of his mysterious death:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>1) Qa'qa and his men dashed towards the Sassanid Headquarter. Meanwhile, in the middle of a sandstorm, Rostam was found dead with over 600 wounds on his body. The Persians were not aware of his death, though, and they continued to fight. The Sassanid right wing counter-attacked and gained its lost position, as the Muslims' left wing retreated back to their original position. The Muslims' left center, now under Qaâ€™qa's command, when denied the support of their left wing, also retreated back to its original position. Saad now ordered a general attack on the Sassanid front to drive away the Persians, demoralized by the death of their charismatic leader. In the afternoon the Muslims mounted another attack.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>2) There was a heavy sandstorm facing the Persian army on the final day of the battle. Rostam lay next to a camel to shelter himself from the storm, while some weapons, such as axes, maces, and swords had been loaded on the camel. HilÄl ibn `Ullafah accidentally cut the girdle of the load on the camel, not knowing that Rostam was behind and under it. The weapons fell on Rostam and broke his back leaving him half dead and paralyzed. Hilal beheaded Rostam and shouted "I swear to the god of Kaaba that I have killed Rostam." Shocked by the head of their legendary leader dangling before their eyes, the Persians were demoralized, and the commanders lost control of the army. Many Persian soldiers were slain in the chaos, many escaped through the river, and finally the rest of the army surrendered.

<p>The Sassanid front, after putting up a last resistance, finally collapsed; part of the Sassanid army retreated in an organized manner while the rest retreated in panic towards the river. At this stage Galinus took command of what was left of the Sassanid army and claimed control of the bridge head, succeeding in getting the bulk of the army across the bridge safely. The battle of Qaddisiyyah was over, and the Muslims were victorious. Saad sent the cavalry regiments in various directions to pursue the fleeing Persians. The stragglers that the Muslims met along the way were either killed or taken captive. Heavy casualties were suffered by the Sassanids during these pursuits.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aftermath">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>From this battle, the Arab Muslims gained a large amount of spoils, including the famed jewel-encrusted royal standard, called the <i>Derafsh-e-KÄveyÄn</i> (the 'flag of KÄveh'). The jewel was cut up and sold in pieces in Medina. The Arab fighters became known as â€˜â€™ahl al-QÄdisiyyahâ€™â€™ and held the highest prestige of the later Arab settlers within Iraq and its important garrison town, Kufa.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Once the battle of Qadisiyya was over, Sa'ad sent a report of the Muslim victory to Umar. The battle shook the Sassanian rule in Iraq to its foundations but was not the end of their rule in Iraq. As long as the Sassanids held their capital Ctesiphon, there was always the danger that at some suitable moment they would make an attempt to recover what they had lost and drive away the Arabs from Iraq. Caliph Umar thus sent instructions to Saad that as a sequel to the battle of Qadisiyyah, the Muslims should push forward to capture Ctesiphon. The Siege of Ctesiphon continued for two months, and the city was finally taken in March 637. Muslim forces conquered the Persian provinces up to Khuzistan. The conquest was slowed, however, by a severe drought in Arabia in 638 and the plague in southern Iraq and Syria in 639. After this, Caliph Umar wanted a break to manage the conquered territories and for then he wanted to leave the rest of Persia to the Persians. Umar is reported to have said:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r856303468" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p><i>"I wish there were a mountain of fire between us and the Persians, so that neither they could get to us, nor we to them."</i>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The Persian perspective however, was the polar opposite, one of great embarrassment, humiliation, and scorn. The pride of the imperial Sassanids had been hurt by the conquest of Iraq by the Arabs, and they continued the struggle to regain the lost territory. Thus a major Persian counterattack was launched and subsequently repulsed at the Battle of Nahavand, fought in December 641.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">54</span></p><p>After that, a full-scale invasion of the Sassanid Persian empire was planned by Umar to conquer his arch-rival entirely. The last Persian emperor was Yazdgerd III, who was killed in 653 during the reign of the Caliph Uthman. His death officially marks the end of the Sassanid royal lineage and empire.
