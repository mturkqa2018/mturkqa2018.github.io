<p>A <b>website</b><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> is a collection of related web pages</a>, including multimedia</a> content, typically identified with a common domain name</a>, and published on at least one web server</a>. Notable examples are wikipedia.org</a>, google.com</a>, and amazon.com</a>. Today roughly 380 new websites are created every minute across the World.<sup id="cite_ref-Guide_to_the_World_of_Websites_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol</a> (IP) network, such as the Internet</a>, or a private local area network</a> (LAN), by referencing a uniform resource locator</a> (URL) that identifies the site.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website</a>, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking</a> to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web</a>, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an intranet</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Web pages, which are the building blocks</a> of websites, are documents</a>, typically composed in plain text</a> interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML</a>, XHTML</a>). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors</a>. Web pages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption (HTTP Secure</a>, HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often a web browser</a>, renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Hyperlinking</a> between web pages conveys to the reader the site structure</a> and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page</a> containing a directory of the site web content</a>. Some websites require user registration or subscription</a> to access content. Examples of subscription websites</a> include many business sites, news websites, academic journal</a> websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards</a>, web-based email</a>, social networking</a> websites, websites providing real-time stock market</a> data, as well as sites providing various other services. End users</a> can access websites on a range of devices, including desktop</a> and laptop computers</a>, tablet computers</a>, smartphones</a> and smart TVs</a>.

<p>The World Wide Web</a> (WWW) was created in 1990 by the British CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-First_page_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> On 30 April 1993, CERN</a> announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone.<sup id="cite_ref-w3c_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Before the introduction of HTML and HTTP, other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol</a> and the gopher protocol</a> were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure</a> which the user navigates and where they choose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting, or were encoded in word processor</a> formats.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Websites have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website</a>, a commercial website, a government website</a> or a non-profit organization</a> website. Websites can be the work of an individual, a business or other organization, and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose. Any website can contain a hyperlink</a> to any other website, so the distinction between individual sites, as perceived by the user, can be blurred. Websites are written in, or converted to, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language</a>) and are accessed using a software</a> interface classified as a user agent</a>. Web pages can be viewed or otherwise accessed from a range of computer</a>-based and Internet-enabled devices of various sizes, including desktop computers, laptops</a>, tablet computers and smartphones. A website is hosted</a> on a computer system known as a web server</a>, also called an HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) server. These terms can also refer to the software that runs on these systems which retrieves and delivers the web pages in response to requests from the website's users. Apache</a> is the most commonly used web server software (according to Netcraft</a> statistics) and Microsoft</a>'s IIS</a> is also commonly used. Some alternatives, such as Nginx</a>, Lighttpd</a>, Hiawatha</a> or Cherokee</a>, are fully functional and lightweight.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Static_website">Static website</span></h2>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Static web page</a></div>
<p>A static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language</a> (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML.  Images are commonly used to effect the desired appearance and as part of the main content.  Audio or video might also be considered "static" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos and other content and may require basic website design skills and software.  Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as <i>classic website</i>, a <i>five-page website</i> or a <i>brochure website</i> are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Static websites can be edited using four broad categories of software:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<ul><li>Text editors</a>, such as Notepad</a> or TextEdit</a>, where content and HTML markup are manipulated directly within the editor program</li>
<li>WYSIWYG</a> offline editors, such as Microsoft FrontPage</a> and Adobe Dreamweaver</a> (previously Macromedia Dreamweaver), with which the site is edited using a GUI</a> and the final HTML markup is generated automatically by the editor software</li>
<li>WYSIWYG online editors which create media rich online presentation like web pages, widgets, intro, blogs, and other documents.</li>
<li>Template-based editors</a> such as iWeb</a> allow users to create and upload web pages to a web server without detailed HTML knowledge, as they pick a suitable template from a palette and add pictures and text to it in a desktop publishing</a> fashion without direct manipulation of HTML code.</li></ul>
<p>Static websites may still use server side includes</a> (SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages. As the site's behaviour <i>to the reader</i> is still static, this is not considered a dynamic site.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main articles: Dynamic web page</a> and Web application</a></div>
<p>A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. Server-side dynamic pages are generated "on the fly" by computer code that produces the HTML (CSS are responsible for appearance and thus, are static files).  There are a wide range of software systems, such as CGI</a>, Java Servlets</a> and Java Server Pages</a> (JSP), Active Server Pages</a>  and ColdFusion</a> (CFML) that are available to generate dynamic web systems and dynamic sites</a>.  Various web application frameworks</a> and web template systems</a> are available for general-use programming languages</a> like Perl</a>, PHP</a>, Python</a> and Ruby</a> to make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic websites.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>A site can display the current state of a dialogue between users, monitor a changing situation, or provide information in some way personalized to the requirements of the individual user.  For example, when the front page of a news site is requested, the code running on the web server might combine stored HTML fragments with news stories retrieved from a database</a> or another website via RSS</a> to produce a page that includes the latest information.  Dynamic sites can be interactive by using HTML forms</a>, storing and reading back browser cookies</a>, or by creating a series of pages that reflect the previous history of clicks.  Another example of dynamic content is when a retail website with a database of media products allows a user to input a search request, e.g. for the keyword Beatles</a>. In response, the content of the web page will spontaneously change the way it looked before, and will then display a list of Beatles products like CDs, DVDs and books. Dynamic HTML</a> uses JavaScript</a> code to instruct the web browser how to interactively modify the page contents. One way to simulate a certain type of dynamic website while avoiding the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis, is to periodically automatically regenerate a large series of static pages.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Multimedia_and_interactive_content">Multimedia and interactive content</span></h2>
<p>Early websites had only text, and soon after, images.  Web browser plug ins</a> were then used to add audio, video, and interactivity (such as for a rich Internet application</a> that mirrors the complexity of a desktop application like a word processor</a>). Examples of such plug-ins are Microsoft Silverlight</a>, Adobe Flash</a>, Adobe Shockwave</a>, and applets</a> written in Java</a>.  HTML 5</a> includes provisions for audio and video without plugins.  JavaScript</a> is also built into most modern web browsers, and allows for website creators to send code to the web browser that instructs it how to interactively modify page content and communicate with the web server if needed.  The browser's internal representation of the content is known as the Document Object Model</a> (DOM) and the technique is known as Dynamic HTML</a>. A 2010-era trend in websites called "responsive design" has given the best of viewing experience as it provides with a device based layout for users. These websites change their layout according to the device or mobile platform thus giving a rich user experience.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spelling">Spelling</span></h2>
<p>While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized "Web site", since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web</a>), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and the <i>AP Stylebook</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> have reflected this change.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h2>
<p>Websites can be divided into two broad categories—static and interactive.  Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0</a> community of sites, and allow for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users.  Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly. Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts or for personal use or entertainment.  Many websites do aim to make money, using one or more business models, including:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p>
<ul><li>Posting interesting content and selling contextual advertising</a> either through direct sales or through an advertising network.</li>
<li>E-commerce</a>: products or services are purchased directly through the website</li>
<li>Advertising products or services available at a brick and mortar business</a></li>
<li>Freemium</a>: basic content is available for free but premium content requires a payment (e.g., WordPress</a> website, it is an open source platform to build a blog or website.)</li></ul>
<p>There are many varieties of websites, each specializing in a particular type of content or use, and they may be arbitrarily classified in any number of ways. A few such classifications might include:

<p>Some websites may be included in one or more of these categories. For example, a business website may promote the business's products, but may also host informative documents, such as white papers</a>. There are also numerous sub-categories to the ones listed above. For example, a porn</a> site is a specific type of e-commerce site or business site (that is, it is trying to sell memberships for access to its site) or have social networking capabilities. A fansite</a> may be a dedication from the owner to a particular celebrity</a>. Websites are constrained by architectural limits (e.g., the computing power dedicated to the website). Very large websites, such as Facebook, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google employ many servers and load balancing</a> equipment such as Cisco</a> Content Services Switches</a> to distribute visitor loads over multiple computers at multiple locations.  As of early 2011, Facebook utilized 9 data centers with approximately 63,000 servers.
