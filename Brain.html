<p>The <b>brain</b> is an organ</a> that serves as the center of the nervous system</a> in all vertebrate</a> and most invertebrate</a> animals. The brain is located in the head</a>, usually close to the sensory organs for senses</a> such as vision</a>. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex</a> contains approximately 10–20 billion neurons</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-pmid27187682_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum</a> is 55–70 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-pmid27187682_1-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Each neuron is connected by synapses</a> to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic</a> fibers called axons</a>, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials</a> to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Physiologically</a>, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones</a>. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment</a>. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes</a> can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia</a>, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain</a> insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain disease</a> and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.

<p>The shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species, and identifying common features is often difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-Shepherd_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Nevertheless, there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species.<sup id="cite_ref-Sporns2010_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species;<sup id="cite_ref-Başar2010_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> others distinguish "advanced" brains from more primitive ones, or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates.<sup id="cite_ref-Shepherd_3-1" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives</a>, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter</a>, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter</a>, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure</a> of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.<sup id="cite_ref-Singh2006_6-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>

When a pulse of electricity reaches a junction called a synapse</a>, it causes a neurotransmitter chemical to be released, which binds to receptors on other cells and thereby alters their electrical activity.</div></div></div>
<p>The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons</a> and glial cells</a>. Glial cells (also known as <i>glia</i> or <i>neuroglia</i>) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-0" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-1" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell</a>, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses</a>. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-2" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter</a> to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor</a> molecules in the membrane of the target cell.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-3" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Synapses are the key functional elements of the brain.<sup id="cite_ref-ShepherdSOB_10-0" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication</a>, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses;<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems</a> that change the internal chemistry</a> of their target cells in complex ways.<sup id="cite_ref-ShepherdSOB_10-1" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<ul><li>Fruit flies (<i>Drosophila</i>), because of the large array of techniques available for studying their genetics</a>, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of <i>Drosophila</i> neurogenetics</a> have been shown to be relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes</a>, for example, were identified by examining <i>Drosophila</i> mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil</a> regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The nematode worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</a></i>, like <i>Drosophila</i>, has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner</a> chose it as a model organism</a> for studying the way that genes control development.

<p>The first vertebrates</a> appeared over 500&#160;million years ago (Mya</a>), during the Cambrian period</a>, and may have resembled the modern hagfish</a> in form.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Sharks appeared about 450&#160;Mya, amphibians about 400&#160;Mya, reptiles about 350&#160;Mya, and mammals about 200&#160;Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history</a>, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys</a>, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon</a>) is greatly elaborated and expanded.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Brains are most simply compared in terms of their size. The relationship between brain size</a>, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species. As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion. In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size. For mammals, the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law</a> with an exponent</a> of about 0.75.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>  This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior. For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey, relative to body size.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>

<p>All vertebrate brains share a common underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the neural tube</a>; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon</a>, mesencephalon</a>, and rhombencephalon</a>, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-5" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-6" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue</a> membranes</a> called meninges</a> that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels</a> enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier</a>, which blocks the passage of many toxins</a> and pathogens</a><sup id="cite_ref-CarpenterCh1_34-0" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> (though at the same time blocking antibodies</a> and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Neuroanatomists</a> usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions: the telencephalon</a> (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon</a> (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon</a> (midbrain), cerebellum</a>, pons</a>, and medulla oblongata</a>. Each of these areas has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains, some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry, especially in the forebrain area.

<p>Here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components, along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">See also: List of regions in the human brain</a></div>
<ul><li>The <b>medulla</a></b>, along with the spinal cord, contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-8" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>pons</a></b> lies in the brainstem directly above the medulla. Among other things, it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder function, equilibrium, eye movement, facial expressions, and posture.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>hypothalamus</a></b> is a small region at the base of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size. It is composed of numerous small nuclei, each with distinct connections and neurochemistry. The hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles, eating and drinking, and the release of some hormones.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>thalamus</a></b> is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions: some are involved in relaying information to and from the cerebral hemispheres, while others are involved in motivation. The subthalamic area (zona incerta</a>) seems to contain action-generating systems for several types of "consummatory" behaviors such as eating, drinking, defecation, and copulation.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>cerebellum</a></b> modulates the outputs of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, to make them certain and precise. Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity</a> that may take place largely within the cerebellum.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-9" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>optic tectum</a></b> allows actions to be directed toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually referred to as the superior colliculus</a>, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs</a> in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys</a>, this region is the largest part of the brain.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.</li>
<li>The <b>pallium</a></b> is a layer of gray matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ.<sup id="cite_ref-LullFerris1922_43-0" class="reference">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> In reptiles and mammals, it is called the <i>cerebral cortex</i>. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell</a> and spatial memory</a>. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri</a> that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci</a>. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>hippocampus</a></b>, strictly speaking, is found only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that this part of the brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>basal ganglia</a></b> are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain. The primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection</a>: they send inhibitory signals to all parts of the brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia.<sup id="cite_ref-Grillner2005_46-0" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>olfactory bulb</a></b> is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium. It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell).<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mammals">Mammals</span></h4>
<p>The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.<sup id="cite_ref-Northcutt2002_48-0" class="reference">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Size, however, is not the only difference: there are also substantial differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure.<sup id="cite_ref-Barton_49-0" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum</a> is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium</a>. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex</a> or <i>isocortex</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Aboitiz_50-0" class="reference">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala</a>, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.<sup id="cite_ref-Barton_49-1" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus</a>, which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex.<sup id="cite_ref-Northcutt2002_48-1" class="reference">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup> The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum</a>) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-0" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> It changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells</a>, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-1" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>For vertebrates, the early stages of neural development are similar across all species.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-2" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm</a> running along the midline of the back is induced</a> to become the neural plate</a>, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove</a>, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube</a>, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain</a>, midbrain</a>, and hindbrain</a>. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon</a> (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon</a> (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon</a> (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon</a> (which will contain the medulla oblongata</a>). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-3" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Once a neuron is in place, it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone</a>, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes</a> create products that influence axonal pathfinding.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-4" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In many parts of the brain, axons initially "overgrow", and then are "pruned" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-5" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point on the surface of the retina</a> to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer. These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.<sup id="cite_ref-Wong_60-0" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>Similar things happen in other brain areas: an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.<sup id="cite_ref-Wong_60-1" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.<sup id="cite_ref-Purves_1985_59-6" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis</a> is well established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus</a> of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>There has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind</a>, personality, and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture</a> controversy.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments</a> have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Physiology">Physiology</span></h2>
<p>The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells, and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells. The electrical properties</a> of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-10" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Neurotransmitters_and_receptors">Neurotransmitters and receptors</span></h3>
<p>Neurotransmitters</a> are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them—neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell, and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules.
With few exceptions, each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-11" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs</a> exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids</a>, nicotine</a>, heroin, cocaine</a>, alcohol, fluoxetine</a>, chlorpromazine</a>, and many others.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate</a>, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid</a> (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup> Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin</a>, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup> Norepinephrine</a>, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Mehler_69-0" class="reference">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup> Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine</a> and dopamine</a> have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup>

<p>As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography</a> (EEG)<sup id="cite_ref-Niedermeyer_71-0" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> or magnetoencephalography</a> (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep.<sup id="cite_ref-Buzsaki_72-0" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves</a> during sleep, faster alpha waves</a> when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure</a>, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Buzsaki_72-1" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Metabolism">Metabolism</span></h3>
<p>All vertebrates have a blood–brain barrier</a> that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals.

<p>Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain. There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes</a> the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, on the basis of the results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.<sup id="cite_ref-CarewCh1_83-0" class="reference">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal.

<p>The human brain is provided with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals additional senses are present, such as the infrared heat-sense of snakes, the magnetic field sense</a> of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>Each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells,<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-12" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> such as light-receptive neurons in the retina</a> of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea</a> of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus</a> dedicated to one specific sensory modality</a>. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus</a>, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated</a> with signals coming from other sensory systems.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-13" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">45</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Motor_control">Motor control</span></h3>
<p>Motor systems</a> are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements</a>, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons</a> in the spinal cord and hindbrain.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-14" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex</a> responses, and contain pattern generators</a> for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-15" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus</a>, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex</a>, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract</a>. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-16" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle. Arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-20" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>A key component of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus</a> (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves</a> from the two eyes cross. The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms</a>: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of "clock genes". The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the retinohypothalamic tract</a> (RHT), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation</a>, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-21" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Sleep involves great changes in brain activity.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-22" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep,<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference">&#91;90&#93;</a></sup> but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There are two types of sleep: <i>REM sleep</a></i> (with dreaming) and <i>NREM</a></i> (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep</a>, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine</a> and serotonin</a> drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-23" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>For any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others.<sup id="cite_ref-Dougherty_91-0" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur</a>, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard</a> called it—is known as homeostasis</a> (Greek</a> for "standing still").<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup> Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback</a>: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value.<sup id="cite_ref-Dougherty_91-1" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> (This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat</a>.)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">53</span></p><p>In vertebrates, the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus</a>, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function.<sup id="cite_ref-Dougherty_91-2" class="reference">&#91;91&#93;</a></sup> The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland</a>, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The individual animals need to express survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> The motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism</a> in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup> In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain.<sup id="cite_ref-Grillner2005_46-1" class="reference">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup> The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Learning_and_memory">Learning and memory</span></h3>
<p>Almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal</a> argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup> Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity</a> hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss</a> and Terje Lømo</a> published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation</a>: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup> Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF</a>) and physical activity</a> appear to play a beneficial role in the process.<sup id="cite_ref-AirpollutionPhysicalactivity_101-0" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>Neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p>
<ul><li><b>Working memory</a></b> is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies</a>—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Episodic memory</a></b> is the ability to remember the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia</a>, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Semantic memory</a></b> is the ability to learn facts and relationships. This sort of memory is probably stored largely in the cerebral cortex, mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference">&#91;104&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Instrumental learning</a></b> is the ability for rewards and punishments to modify behavior. It is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the basal ganglia.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference">&#91;105&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Motor learning</a></b> is the ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex</a>, basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.<sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference">&#91;106&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>

<p>The field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system.<sup id="cite_ref-Kandel_2000_7-24" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Psychology</a> seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology</a> is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry</a>, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Starrow_1969_107-0" class="reference">&#91;107&#93;</a></sup> Cognitive science</a> seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science</a> (artificial intelligence</a> and similar fields) and philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference">&#91;108&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical</a>, and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining</a> techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, <i>functional neuroanatomy</i> uses medical imaging</a> techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p><p>Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG</a> studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular</a> recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons.<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference">&#91;110&#93;</a></sup> Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy</a>, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference">&#91;111&#93;</a></sup> Functional imaging</a> techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference">&#91;112&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage</a> to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges</a>, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid</a>, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>Computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain; second, the study of how brains perform computation. On one hand, it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are known as <i>biologically realistic neural networks</i>. On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically analyzing, the operations of simplified "units" that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity. The computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists.<sup id="cite_ref-Abbott_115-0" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">63</span></p><p>Computational neurogenetic modeling</a> is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p><p>Recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain <sup id="cite_ref-Tonegawa_116-0" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup> and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-AirpollutionPhysicalactivity_101-1" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup> The most common subjects are mice, because of the availability of technical tools. It is now possible with relative ease to "knock out" or mutate a wide variety of genes, and then examine the effects on brain function. More sophisticated approaches are also being used: for example, using Cre-Lox recombination</a> it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain, at specific times.<sup id="cite_ref-Tonegawa_116-1" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup>

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>Early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart.

<p>The Roman physician Galen</a> also argued for the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work. Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called <i>pneumata psychikon</i>, usually translated as "animal spirits".<sup id="cite_ref-Finger14_118-1" class="reference">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup> Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes</a> and those who followed him. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical <i>res cogitans</i>, but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference">&#91;120&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">69</span></p><p>The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani</a> (1737 – 1798), who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining</a> cells.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference">&#91;121&#93;</a></sup> Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain</a>, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure.

<p>In the first half of the 20th century, advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells, culminating in work by Alan Hodgkin</a>, Andrew Huxley</a>, and others on the biophysics of the action potential, and the work of Bernard Katz</a> and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference">&#91;123&#93;</a></sup> These studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity. Reflecting the new understanding, in 1942 Charles Sherrington</a> visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep:

The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.

<p>The invention of electronic computers in the 1940s, along with the development of mathematical information theory</a>, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics</a>, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-CKS1993_125-0" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup> The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann</a>'s 1958 book, <i>The Computer and the Brain</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup> Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.<sup id="cite_ref-CKS1993_125-1" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">73</span></p><p>One of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled <i>What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain</i>: the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina</a> and optic tectum</a> of frogs, and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as "bug perceivers".<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference">&#91;127&#93;</a></sup> A few years later David Hubel</a> and Torsten Wiesel</a> discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view—a discovery for which they won a Nobel Prize.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference">&#91;128&#93;</a></sup> Follow-up studies in higher-order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity</a>, color, movement, and aspects of shape, with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses.<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference">&#91;129&#93;</a></sup> Other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates, some related to memory, some to abstract types of cognition such as space.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference">&#91;130&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">74</span></p><p>Theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks</a>, which can be simulated using computers.<sup id="cite_ref-CKS1993_125-2" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup> Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup> No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.<sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference">&#91;132&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">75</span></p><p>Furthermore, even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference">&#91;133&#93;</a></sup> So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project</a> is trying to build a realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists on both sides of the argument.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></p><p>In the second half of the 20th century, developments in chemistry, electron microscopy, genetics, computer science, functional brain imaging, and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function. In the United States, the 1990s were officially designated as the "Decade of the Brain</a>" to commemorate advances made in brain research, and to promote funding for such research.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference">&#91;134&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">77</span></p><p>In the 21st century, these trends have continued, and several new approaches have come into prominence, including multielectrode recording</a>, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time;<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference">&#91;135&#93;</a></sup> genetic engineering</a>, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally;<sup id="cite_ref-Tonegawa_116-2" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup> genomics</a>, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA</a> properties<sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference">&#91;136&#93;</a></sup> and neuroimaging</a>.
