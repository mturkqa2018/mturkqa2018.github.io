<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The club was founded in 2003, the club was formed in the late 1990s.  It is named after a red scorpion as there is on the island, the Cape Verde red scorpion (<i>Hottentotta caboverdensis</i>) which is the island's and the country's only scorpion founded and listed in the endangered list. The first club of the name is not the Portuguese name for scorpion which is escorpi√£o, it is the English name, the last name is Portuguese for red. Its English name is not known as the Red Scorpions, especially translingual, but Scorpion Vermelho. The Capeverdean Creole of ALUPEC is called Scorpion Bermedju and not Skorpion Bermedju.
