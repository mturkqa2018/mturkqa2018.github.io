The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the RÃ­o de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. "Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra SeÃ±ora Santa MarÃ­a del Buen Ayre". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 15.6 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: <b>Autonomous City of Buenos Aires</b> (<i>Ciudad AutÃ³noma de Buenos Aires</i>; "CABA"). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Buenos Aires is considered an 'alpha city' by the study GaWC5. Buenos Aires' quality of life was ranked 91st in the world, being one of the best in Latin America in 2018. It is the most visited city in South America, and the second-most visited city of Latin America (behind Mexico City).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Buenos Aires is a top tourist destination, and is known for its preserved Eclectic European architecture and rich cultural life. Buenos Aires held the 1st Pan American Games in 1951 as well as hosting two venues in the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Buenos Aires hosted the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics and the 2018 G20 summit.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Buenos Aires is a multicultural city, being home to multiple ethnic and religious groups. Several languages are spoken in the city in addition to Spanish, contributing to its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country. This is because in the last 150 years the city, and the country in general, has been a major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over the world, making it a melting pot where several ethnic groups live together and being considered one of the most diverse cities of the Americas.

<p>It is recorded under the archives of Aragonese that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city. The hill was known to them as <i>Bonaira</i> (or <i>Bonaria</i> in Sardinian language), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland. During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill. In 1335, King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians, who built an abbey that stands to this day. In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the Mediterranean Sea. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially Andalusians, venerated this image and frequently invoked the "Fair Winds" to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks. A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would be later erected in Seville.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In the first foundation of Buenos Aires, Spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the RÃ­o de la Plata by the blessings of the "Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires", the "Holy Virgin Mary of the Good Winds" who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of Buenos Aires. Pedro de Mendoza called the city "Holy Mary of the Fair Winds", a name suggested by the chaplain of Mendoza's expedition â€“ a devotee of the Virgin of Buen Ayre â€“ after the Sardinian <i>Madonna de Bonaria</i> (that is still to this day the patroness of Sardinia). Mendoza's settlement soon came under attack by indigenous people, and was abandoned in 1541.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>For many years, the name was attributed to a Sancho del Campo, who is said to have exclaimed: <i>How fair are the winds of this land!</i>, as he arrived. But Eduardo Madero, in 1882 after conducting extensive research in Spanish archives, ultimately concluded that the name was indeed closely linked with the devotion of the sailors to Our Lady of Buen Ayre.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by Juan de Garay, who sailed down the ParanÃ¡ River from AsunciÃ³n (now the capital of Paraguay). Garay preserved the name originally chosen by Mendoza, calling the city <i>Ciudad de la SantÃ­sima Trinidad y Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a del Buen Aire</i> ("City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds"). The short form "Buenos Aires" became the common usage during the 17th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The usual abbreviation for Buenos Aires in Spanish is Bs.As. It is common as well to refer to it as "B.A." or "BA".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>While "BA" is used more by expats residing in the city, the locals more often use the abbreviation "Baires", in one word.

<p>Seaman Juan DÃ­az de SolÃ­s, navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the RÃ­o de la Plata in 1516. His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native CharrÃºa tribe in what is now Uruguay.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The city of Buenos Aires was first established as <i>Ciudad de Nuestra SeÃ±ora Santa MarÃ­a del Buen Ayre</i> (literally "City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds") after Our Lady of Bonaria (Patroness Saint of Sardinia) on 2 February 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Mendoza. The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires, south of the city centre.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>More attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away, and in 1542 the site was abandoned.  A second (and permanent) settlement was established on 11 June 1580 by Juan de Garay, who arrived by sailing down the ParanÃ¡ River from AsunciÃ³n (now the capital of Paraguay). He dubbed the settlement "SantÃ­sima Trinidad" and its port became "Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a de los Buenos Aires."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>From its earliest days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During most of the 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies, to Lima, Peru and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among <i>porteÃ±os</i> towards the Spanish authorities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Sensing these feelings, Charles III of Spain progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port in the late 18th century. The capture of Porto Bello by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of PerÃº and create instead the Viceroyalty of the RÃ­o de la Plata, with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the <i>porteÃ±os</i>, some of them versed in the ideology of the French Revolution, became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.

<p>During the British invasions of the RÃ­o de la Plata, British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to CÃ³rdoba and designated this city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its liberation, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled the attempted invasion of 1807. The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the criollos (in contrast to peninsulars), as well as the development of the Peninsular War in Spain. An attempt by the peninsular merchant MartÃ­n de Ãlzaga to remove Liniers and replace him with a Junta was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. This is known as the May Revolution, which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the Argentine War of Independence, and many armies left Buenos Aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two triumvirates, and finally by a unipersonal office, the Supreme Director. Formal independence from Spain was declared in 1816, at the Congress of TucumÃ¡n. Buenos Aires managed to endure the whole Spanish American wars of independence without falling again under royalist rule.

<p>Historically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina's main venue of liberal, free-trading and foreign ideas, while many of the provinces, especially those to the north-west, advocated a more nationalistic and Catholic approach to political and social issues. Much of the internal tension in Argentina's history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the months immediately following the 25 May Revolution, Buenos Aires sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval. Many of these missions ended in violent clashes, and the enterprise fuelled tensions between the capital and the provinces.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>In the 19th century the city was blockaded twice by naval forces: by the French from 1838 to 1840, and later by an Anglo-French expedition from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to force the city into submission, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.

<p>During most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The Casa Rosada became the seat of the president.

Health conditions in poor areas were negative, with high rates of tuberculosis.  Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones. <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="2339" data-file-width="3498" decoding="async" height="147" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Museo_del_Bicentenario_-_%22La_Casa_Rosada%22_por_Della_Valle.jpg/220px-Museo_del_Bicentenario_-_%22La_Casa_Rosada%22_por_Della_Valle.jpg" srcset width="220"/> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div><div style='border: 3px solid red'><center><h1 style='color:red'>7</h1></center></div>The Casa Rosada during the Argentina Centennial, 1910.</div></div></div><p>
In addition to the wealth generated by the Buenos Aires Customs and the fertile pampas, railroad development in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930 Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with the major European capitals. The ColÃ³n Theater became one of the world's top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of radio, television, cinema, and theatre. The city's main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America's tallest buildings and its first underground system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city. <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><div class="thumb tright"><div

<p>Buenos Aires also attracted migrants from Argentina's provinces and neighboring countries. Shanty towns (<i>villas miseria</i>) started growing around the city's industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly-mobile Buenos Aires population. These laborers became the political base of Peronism, which emerged in Buenos Aires during the pivotal demonstration of 17 October 1945, at the Plaza de Mayo. Industrial workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism's main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country's political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see <i>Bombing of Plaza de Mayo</i>). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which deposed President PerÃ³n, three months later (see <i>RevoluciÃ³n Libertadora</i>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>In the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements (Montoneros, E.R.P. and F.A.R.) and the right-wing paramilitary group Triple A, supported by Isabel PerÃ³n, who became president of Argentina in 1974 after Juan PerÃ³n's death.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>The March 1976 coup, led by General Jorge Videla, only escalated this conflict; the "Dirty War" resulted in 30,000 <i>desaparecidos</i> (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta). The silent marches of their mothers (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) are a well-known image of Argentines' suffering during those times. The dictatorship's appointed mayor, Osvaldo Cacciatore, also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city's acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>The city was visited by Pope John Paul II twice, firstly in 1982 and again in 1987; on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city's history. The return of democracy in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival, particularly in the construction and financial sectors.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>On 17 March 1992 a bomb exploded in the Israeli Embassy, killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994, destroyed a building housing several Jewish organizations, killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of Middle Eastern terrorism to South America. Following a 1993 agreement, the Argentine Constitution was amended to give Buenos Aires autonomy and rescinding, among other things, the president's right to appoint the city's mayor (as had been the case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in Buenos Aires chose their first elected mayor (<i>Jefe de Gobierno</i>).

<p>In 1996, following the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to "Head of Government". The winner was Fernando de la RÃºa, who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>De la RÃºa's successor, AnÃ­bal Ibarra, won two popular elections, but was impeached (and ultimately deposed on 6 March 2006) as a result of the fire at the RepÃºblica Cromagnon nightclub. Jorge Telerman, who had been the acting mayor, was invested with the office. In the 2007 elections, Mauricio Macri of the Republican Proposal (PRO) party won the second-round of voting over Daniel Filmus of the Frente para la Victoria (FPV) party, taking office on 9 December 2007. In 2011, the elections went to a second round with 60.96% of the vote for PRO, compared to 39.04% for FPV, thus re-electing Macri as mayor of the city with MarÃ­a Eugenia Vidal as deputy mayor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>The 2015 elections were the first to use an electronic voting system in the city, similar to the one used in Salta Province. In these elections held on 5 July 2015, Macri stepped down as mayor and pursue his presidential bid and Horacio RodrÃ­guez Larreta took his place as the mayoral candidate for PRO. In the first round of voting, FPV's Mariano Recalde obtained 21.78% of the vote, while MartÃ­n Lousteau of the ECO party obtained 25.59% and Larreta obtained 45.55%, meaning that the elections went to a second round since PRO was unable to secure the majority required for victory. The second round was held on 19 July 2015 and Larreta obtained 51.6% of the vote, followed closely by Lousteau with 48.4%, thus, PRO won the elections for a third term with Larreta as mayor and Diego Santilli as deputy. In these elections, PRO was stronger in the wealthier neighbourhoods of northern Buenos Aires, while ECO was stronger in the south of the city.

<p>The city of Buenos Aires lies in the pampa region, except for some zones like the Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve, the Boca Juniors (football) Club "sports city", Jorge Newbery Airport, the Puerto Madero neighborhood and the main port itself; these were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata (the world's widest river).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>The region was formerly crossed by different streams and lagoons, some of which were refilled and others tubed. Among the most important streams are Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, CildaÃ±ez and White. In 1908 many streams were channelled and rectified, as floods were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most streams were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue.

<p>Under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Buenos Aires has a humid subtropical climate (<i>Cfa</i>) with four distinct seasons. As a result of maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, the climate is temperate with extreme temperatures being rare. Because the city is located in an area where the Pampero and Sudestada winds pass by, the weather is variable due to these contrasting air masses.

However, most heat waves are of short duration (less than a week) and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind which brings violent and intense thunderstorms followed by cooler temperatures. The highest temperature ever recorded was 43.3Â Â°C (110Â Â°F) on 29 January 1957.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Winters are cool with mild temperatures during the day and chilly nights. Highs during the season average 16.3Â Â°C (61.3Â Â°F) while lows average 8.1Â Â°C (46.6Â Â°F). Relative humidity averages in the upper 70s%, which means the city is noted for moderate-to-heavy fogs during autumn and winter. July is the coolest month, with an average temperature of 11.0Â Â°C (51.8Â Â°F). Cold spells originating from Antarctica occur almost every year, and can persist for several days. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. The lowest temperature ever recorded in central Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Central Observatory) was âˆ’5.4Â Â°C (22Â Â°F) on 9 July 1918. Snow is very rare in the city: the last snowfall occurred on 9 July 2007 when, during the coldest winter in Argentina in almost 30 years, severe snowfalls and blizzards hit the country. It was the first major snowfall in the city in 89 years.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>Spring and autumn are characterized by changeable weather conditions. Cold air from the south can bring cooler temperatures while hot humid air from the north bring hot temperatures.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>The city receives 1,236.3Â mm (49Â in) of precipitation per year. Because of its geomorphology along with an inadequate drainage network, the city is highly vulnerable to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall.

<p>The Executive is held by the Chief of Government (Spanish: <i lang="es">Jefe de Gobierno</i>), elected for a four-year term together with a Deputy Chief of Government, who presides over the 60-member Buenos Aires City Legislature. Each member of the Legislature is elected for a four-year term; half of the legislature is renewed every two years. Elections use the D'Hondt method of proportional representation. The Judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justicia), the Magistrate's Council (Consejo de la Magistratura), the Public Ministry, and other City Courts. Article 61 of the 1996 Constitution of the City of Buenos Aires states that "<i>Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative. Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law</i>."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Legally, the city has less autonomy than the Provinces. In June 1996, shortly before the City's first Executive elections were held, the Argentine National Congress issued the National Law 24.588 (known as Ley Cafiero, after the Senator who advanced the projemacct) by which the authority over the 25,000-strong Argentine Federal Police and the responsibility over the federal institutions residing at the City (e.g., National Supreme Court of Justice buildings) would not be transferred from the National Government to the Autonomous City Government until a new consensus could be reached at the National Congress. Furthermore, it declared that the Port of Buenos Aires, along with some other places, would remain under constituted federal authorities. As of 2011, the deployment of the Metropolitan Police of Buenos Aires is ongoing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>Beginning in 2007, the city has embarked on a new decentralization scheme, creating new Communes (<i>comunas</i>) which are to be managed by elected committees of seven members each. Buenos Aires is represented in the Argentine Senate by three senators (as of 2017, Federico Pinedo, Marta Varela and Pino Solanas). The people of Buenos Aires also elect 25 national deputies to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies.

<p>In the census of 2010 there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city. The population of Greater Buenos Aires was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data. The population density in Buenos Aires proper was 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (34,800 per mi), but only about 2,400 per km (6,100 per mi) in the suburbs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">48</span></p><p>The population of Buenos Aires proper has hovered around 3 million since 1947, due to low birth rates and a slow migration to the suburbs. The surrounding districts have, however, expanded over fivefold (to around 10Â million) since then.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>The 2001 census showed a relatively aged population: with 17% under the age of fifteen and 22% over sixty, the people of Buenos Aires have an age structure similar to those in most European cities. They are older than Argentines as a whole (of whom 28% were under 15, and 14% over 60).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">50</span></p><p>Two-thirds of the city's residents live in apartment buildings and 30% in single-family homes; 4% live in sub-standard housing. Measured in terms of income, the city's poverty rate was 8.4% in 2007 and, including the metro area, 20.6%. Other studies estimate that 4 million people in the metropolitan Buenos Aires area live in poverty.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>The city's resident labor force of 1.2Â million in 2001 was mostly employed in the services sector, particularly social services (25%), commerce and tourism (20%) and business and financial services (17%); despite the city's role as Argentina's capital, public administration employed only 6%. Manufacturing still employed 10%.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main articles: Barrios of Buenos Aires and Communes of Buenos Aires</div>
<p>The city is divided into <i>barrios</i> (neighborhoods) for administrative purposes, a division originally based on Catholic <i>parroquias</i> (parishes). A common expression is that of the <i>Cien barrios porteÃ±os</i> ("One hundred <i>porteÃ±o</i> neighborhoods"), referring to a composition made popular in the 1940s by tango singer Alberto Castillo; however, Buenos Aires only consists of 48 official <i>barrios</i>. There are a several subdivisions of these districts, some with a long history and others that are the product of a real estate invention. A notable example is Palermo â€” the city's largest district â€” which has been subdivided into various <i>barrios</i>, including Palermo Soho, Palermo Hollywood, Las CaÃ±itas and Palermo Viejo, among others. A newer scheme has divided the city into 15 <i>comunas</i> (communes).

<p>The majority of <i>porteÃ±os</i> have European origins, mostly from the Calabrian, Ligurian, Piedmont, Lombardy, Sicily and Campania regions of Italy and from the Andalusian, Galician, Asturian, and Basque regions of Spain.  Unrestricted waves of European immigrants to Argentina starting in the mid-19th century significantly increased the country's population, even causing the number of porteÃ±os to triple between 1887 and 1915 from 500,000 to 1.5 million.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>Other significant European origins include German, Irish, Norwegian, Polish, French, Portuguese, Swedish, Greek, Czech, Albanian, Croatian, Dutch, Russian, Serbian, English, Hungarian and Bulgarian. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a small wave of immigration from Romania and Ukraine. There is a minority of <i>criollo</i> citizens, dating back to the Spanish colonial days. The <i>Criollo</i> and Spanish-aboriginal (mestizo) population in the city has increased mostly as a result of immigration from the inner provinces and from other countries such as neighboring Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and Peru, since the second half of the 20th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>The Jewish community in Greater Buenos Aires numbers around 250,000, and is the largest in Latin America. The city is also eighth largest in the world in terms of Jewish population. Most are of Northern, Western, Central, and Eastern European Ashkenazi origin, primarily Swedish, Dutch, Polish, German, and Russian Jews, with a significant Sephardic minority, mostly made up of Syrian Jews and Lebanese Jews. Important Lebanese, Georgian, Syrian and Armenian communities have had a significant presence in commerce and civic life since the beginning of the 20th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>Most East Asian immigration in Buenos Aires comes from China. Chinese immigration is the fourth largest in Argentina, with the vast majority of them living in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area. In the 1980s, most of them were from Taiwan, but since the 1990s the majority of Chinese immigrants come from the continental province of Fujian. The mainland Chinese who came from Fujian mainly installed supermarkets throughout the city and the suburbs; these supermarkets are so common that, in average, there is one every two and a half blocks and are simply referred to as <i>el chino</i> ("the Chinese"). Japanese immigrants are mostly from the Okinawa Prefecture. They started the dry cleaning business in Argentina, an activity that is considered idiosyncratic to the Japanese immigrants in Buenos Aires. Korean Immigration occurred after the division of Korea; they mainly settled in Flores and Once.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p><p>In the 2010 census <small>[INDEC]</small>, 2.1% of the population or 61,876 persons declared to be Amerindian or first-generation descendants of Amerindians in Buenos Aires (not including the 24 adjacent Partidos that make up Greater Buenos Aires). Amongst the 61,876 persons who are of indigenous origin, 15.9% are Quechua people, 15.9% are GuaranÃ­, 15.5% are Aymara and 11% are Mapuche. Within the 24 adjacent Partidos, 186,640 persons or 1.9% of the total population declared themselves to be Amerindian. Amongst the 186,640 persons who are of indigenous origin, 21.2% are GuaranÃ­, 19% are Toba, 11.3% are Mapuche, 10.5% are Quechua and 7.6% are Diaguita.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>In the city, 15,764 people identified themselves as Afro-Argentine in the 2010 Census.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h3><p>
According to a 2008 CONICET survey on creeds, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Buenos Aires (79.6%), and most inhabitants are Roman Catholic (70%), though studies in recent decades found that fewer than 20% are practicing. Buenos Aires is the seat of a Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishop (the Catholic <i>primate</i> of Argentina), currently Archbishop Mario Poli. His predecessor, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, was elected to the Papacy as Pope Francis on 13 March 2013. There are Protestant, Orthodox Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormon, and Buddhist minorities. The city is home to the largest mosque in South America. Also, irreligion in Buenos Aires is higher than in other parts of the country, with about an 18.0% of the <i>porteÃ±os</i> declaring themselves as either atheist or agnostic.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Villas miserias range from small groups of precarious houses to larger, more organised communities with thousands of residents. In rural areas, the houses in the villas miserias might be made of mud and wood. Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, CÃ³rdoba and Mendoza, among others
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>Buenos Aires has below 2Â m (22Â sqÂ ft) of green space per person, which is 90% less than New York, 85% less than Madrid and 80% less than Paris. The World Health Organization (WHO), in its concern for public health, produced a document stating that every city should have a minimum of 9Â m (97Â sqÂ ft) of green space per person. An optimal amount would sit between 10 and 15Â m (161Â sqÂ ft) per person.

Buenos Aires is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina. The economy in the city proper alone, measured by Gross Geographic Product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US$84.7Â billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2011 and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina's as a whole. Metro Buenos Aires, according to one well-quoted study, constitutes the 13th largest economy among the world's cities. The Buenos Aires Human Development Index (0.923 in 1998) is likewise high by international standards. <span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">69</span></p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:192px;"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="2886" data-file-width="3810" decoding="async" height="144" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Microcentro%2C_Buenos_Aires_%2839921080405%29.jpg/190px-Microcentro%2C_Buenos_Aires_%2839921080405%29.jpg" srcset width="190"/> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div><div style='border: 3px solid red'><center><h1 style='color:red'>16</h1></center></div>The Catalinas Norte is an important business complex composed of nineteen commercial office buildings and occupied by numerous leading Argentine companies, foreign subsidiaries and diplomatic offices.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Port of Buenos Aires</div>
<p>The port of Buenos Aires is one of the busiest in South America; navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to north-east Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the continent. The Port of Buenos Aires handles over 11 million revenue tons annually, and Dock Sud, just south of the city proper, handles another 17 million metric tons. Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past, including a conflict in 2008 that led to protests and a strike in the agricultural sector after the government raised export tariffs.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Services">Services</span></h3>
<p>The city's services sector is diversified and well-developed by international standards, and accounts for 76% of its economy (compared to 59% for all of Argentina's). Advertising, in particular, plays a prominent role in the export of services at home and abroad. The financial and real-estate services sector is the largest, however, and contributes to 31% of the city's economy. Finance (about a third of this) in Buenos Aires is especially important to Argentina's banking system, accounting for nearly half the nation's bank deposits and lending. Nearly 300 hotels and another 300 hostels and bed &amp; breakfasts are licensed for tourism, and nearly half the rooms available were in four-star establishments or higher.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manufacturing">Manufacturing</span></h3>
<p>Manufacturing is, nevertheless, still prominent in the city's economy (16%) and, concentrated mainly in the southern part of the city. It benefits as much from high local purchasing power and a large local supply of skilled labor as it does from its relationship to massive agriculture and industry just outside the city limits. Construction activity in Buenos Aires has historically been among the most accurate indicators of national economic fortunes, and since 2006 around 3Â million square metres (32Â million square feet) of construction has been authorized annually. Meat, dairy, grain, tobacco, wool and leather products are processed or manufactured in the Buenos Aires metro area. Other leading industries are automobile manufacturing, oil refining, metalworking, machine building and the production of textiles, chemicals, clothing and beverages.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Government_finances">Government finances</span></h3>
<p>The city's budget, per Mayor Macri's 2011 proposal, included US$6Â billion in revenues and US$6.3Â billion in expenditures. The city relies on local income and capital gains taxes for 61% of its revenues, while federal revenue sharing contributes 11%, property taxes, 9%, and vehicle taxes, 6%. Other revenues include user fees, fines and gambling duties. The city devotes 26% of its budget to education, 22% for health, 17% for public services and infrastructure, 16% for social welfare and culture, 12% in administrative costs and 4% for law enforcement. Buenos Aires maintains low debt levels and its service requires less than 3% of the budget.

<p>The identity of <i>porteÃ±os</i> has a rich and complex history, and has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. The great European immigration wave of the early 20th century was integral to "the growing primacy of Buenos Aires and the accompanying urban identity", and established the division between urban and rural Argentina more deeply. Immigrants "brought new traditions and cultural markers to the city," which were "then reimagined in the <i>porteÃ±o</i> context, with new layers of meanings because of the new location." The heads of state's attempt to populate the country and reframe the national identity resulted in the concentration of immigrants in the city and its suburbs, who generated a culture that is a "product of their conflicts of integration, their difficulties to live and their communication puzzles." In response to the immigration wave, during the 1920s and 1930s a nationalist trend within the Argentine intellectual elite glorified the gaucho figure as an exemplary archetype of Argentine culture; its synthesis with the European traditions conformed the new urban identity of Buenos Aires. The complexity of Buenos Aires' integration and identity formation issues increased when immigrants realized that their European culture could help them gain a greater social status. As the rural population moved to the industrialized city from the 1930s onwards, they reaffirmed their European roots, adopting endogamy and founding private schools, newspapers in foreign languages, and associations that promoted adherence to their countries of origin.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">77</span></p><p><i>PorteÃ±os</i> are generally characterized as night owls, cultured, talkative, uninhibited, sensitive, nostalgic, observative and arrogant. Argentines outside Buenos Aires often stereotype its inhabitants as egotist people, a feature that people from the Americas and westerners in general commonly attribute to the entire Argentine population and use as the subject of numerous jokes. Writing for BBC Mundo Cristina PÃ©rez felt that "the idea of the [Argentines'] vastly developed ego finds strong evidence in lunfardo dictionaries," in words such as "<i>engrupido</i>" (meaning "vain" or "conceited") and "<i>compadrito</i>" (meaning both "brave" and "braggart"), the latter being an archetypal figure of tango. Paradoxically, <i>porteÃ±os</i> are also described as highly self-critical, something that has been called "the other side of the ego coin." Writers consider that these behaviours are the consequence of the European immigration and prosperity the city experienced during the early 20th century, which generated a feeling of superiority in parts of the population.

<p>Buenos Aires has a thriving arts culture, with "a huge inventory of museums, ranging from obscure to world-class." The <i>barrios</i> of Palermo and Recoleta are the city's traditional bastions in the diffusion of art, although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as Puerto Madero or La Boca; renowned venues include MALBA, the National Museum of Fine Arts, FundaciÃ³n Proa, Faena Arts Center, and the Usina del Arte. Other popular institutions are the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, the Quinquela MartÃ­n Museum, the Evita Museum, the FernÃ¡ndez Blanco Museum, the JosÃ© HernÃ¡ndez Museum, and the Palais de Glace, among others. A traditional event that occurs once a year is <i>La Noche de los Museos</i> ("Night of the Museums"), when the city's museums, universities, and artistic spaces open their doors for free until early morning; it usually takes place in November.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">79</span></p><p>The first major artistic movements in Argentina coincided with the first signs of political liberty in the country, such as the 1913 sanction of the secret ballot and universal male suffrage, the first president to be popularly elected (1916), and the cultural revolution that involved the University Reform of 1918. In this context, in which there continued to be influence from the Paris School (Modigliani, Chagall, Soutine, Klee), three main groups arose.
Buenos Aires has been the birthplace of several artists and movements of national and international relevance, and has become a central motif in Argentine artistic production, specially since the 20th century.  Examples include: the Paris Group - so named for being influenced by the School of Paris - constituted by Antonio Berni, Aquiles Badi, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Raquel Forner and Alfredo Bigatti, among others; and  the La Boca artists - including Benito Quinquela MartÃ­n and Alfredo Lazzari, among others - who mostly came from Italy or were of Italian descent, and usually painted scenes from this working-class port neighbourhood. During the 1960s, the Torcuato di Tella Institute - located in Florida Street - became a leading local center for pop art, performance art, installation art, experimental theatre, and conceptual art; this generation of artists included Marta MinujÃ­n, Dalila Puzzovio, David Lamelas and Clorindo Testa.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">80</span></p><p>Buenos Aires has also become a prominent center of contemporary street art; its welcoming attitude has made it one of the world's top capitals of such expression. The city's turbulent modern political history has "bred an intense sense of expression in <i>porteÃ±os</i>," and urban art has been used to depict these stories and as a means of protest. However, not all of its street art concerns politics, it is also used as a symbol of democracy and freedom of expression. Murals and graffiti are so common that they are considered "an everyday occurrence," and have become part of the urban landscape of <i>barrios</i> such as Palermo, Villa Urquiza, Coghlan and San Telmo. This has to do with the legality of such activities â€”provided that the building owner has consentedâ€”, and the receptiveness of local authorities, who even subsidize various works. The abundance of places for urban artists to create their work, and the relatively lax rules for street art, have attracted international artists such as Blu, Jef AÃ©rosol, Aryz, ROA, and Ron English. Guided tours to see murals and graffiti around the city have been growing steadily.

<p>Despite its short urban history, Buenos Aires has an abundant literary production; its mythical-literary network "has grown at the same rate at which the streets of the city earned its shores to the pampas and buildings stretched its shadow on the curb." The city has at least 734 bookstores, more per person than any other city in the world. Gabriela Adamo, former president of the city's annual book fair, relates the popularity of reading among its inhabitants to the wave of mass immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which created "a multicultural environment in which culture and the arts thrived." Publishing experts have also linked it to the city's obsession with psychoanalysis. The city also ranks third in terms of secondhand bookshops per inhabitant, most of them congregated in Corrientes Avenue. Arguably the most famous bookstore is El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a reformed theatre. <i>The Guardian</i> ranked it second in its list of "The world's 10 best bookshops" in 2008.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">86</span></p><p>Argentine literature began around 1550 with the work of MatÃ­as Rojas de Oquendo and Pedro GonzÃ¡lez de Prado (from Santiago del Estero, the first important urban settlement in Argentina), who wrote prose and poetry.  They were partly inspired by oral aboriginal poetryâ€”in particular, according to Carlos AbregÃº Virreyra, by the <i>lules</i>, <i>jurÃ­es</i>, <i>diaguitas</i> and <i>tonocotÃ©s</i>. A symbiosis emerged between the aboriginal and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, geographically limited (well into the 18th century) to the Argentine north and central regions, with the province of CÃ³rdoba as its center, due to the foundation of the National University of CÃ³rdoba. Two names stand out from this period: Gaspar JuÃ¡rez Baviano, and Antonia de la Paz y Figueroa, also known as "Beata Antula".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">87</span></p><p>Gradually, with the economic prosperity of the port, the cultural axis moved eastward. The letters of the colonial age (Viceroyalty-neoclassicism, baroque and epic) grew under the protection of the independentist fervor: Vicente LÃ³pez y Planes, PantaleÃ³n Rivarola and Esteban de Luca.

<p>The literary history of the country is linked to Buenos Aires' cafÃ©s; some of the old ones still exist, like CafÃ© Tortoni, CafÃ© La Biela, Esquina Homero Manzi, ConfiterÃ­a Las Violetas, ConfiterÃ­a London City and ConfiterÃ­a Hotel Castelar. The city hosts the National Library of the Argentine Republic, the largest library in the country.

<p>Known as <i>Rioplatense Spanish</i>, Buenos Aires' Spanish (as that of other cities like Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay) is characterised by <i>voseo</i>, <i>yeÃ­smo</i> and aspiration of <i>s</i> in various contexts. It is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in Andalusia and Murcia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">91</span></p><p>In the early 20th century, Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, Sicilian and Genoese). Their adoption of Spanish was gradual, creating a pidgin of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called <i>cocoliche</i>. Its usage declined around the 1950s. A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the prosody of <i>porteÃ±o</i> is closer to the Neapolitan language of Italy than to any other spoken language.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">92</span></p><p>Many Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, and Spaniards are still generically referred to in Argentina as <i>gallegos</i> (Galicians). Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a mini-boom in Celtic music (which also highlighted the Welsh traditions of Patagonia).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">93</span></p><p>Yiddish was commonly heard in Buenos Aires, especially in the Balvanera garment district and in Villa Crespo until the 1960s. Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly and assimilate into city life.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">94</span></p><p>The <i>Lunfardo</i> argot originated within the prison population, and in time spread to all <i>porteÃ±os</i>. Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from Brazilian Portuguese, from African and Caribbean languages and even from English. Lunfardo employs humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word (vesre). Today, Lunfardo is mostly heard in tango lyrics; the slang of the younger generations has been evolving away from it.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">95</span></p><p>Buenos Aires was also the first city to host a Mundo Lingo event on 7 July 2011, which have been after replicated in up to 15 cities in 13 countries.

<p>According to the <i>Harvard Dictionary of Music</i>, "Argentina has one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life" in South America. Buenos Aires boasts of several professional orchestras, including the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, the Ensamble Musical de Buenos Aires and the Camerata Bariloche; as well as various conservatories that offer professional music education, like the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de MÃºsica. As a result of the growth and commercial prosperity of the city in the late 18th century, the theatre became a vital force in Argentine musical life, offering Italian and French operas and Spanish zarzuelas. Italian music was very influential during the 19th century and the early 20th century, in part because of immigration, but operas and salon music were also composed by Argentines, including Francisco Hargreaves and Juan GutiÃ©rrez. A nationalist trend that drew from Argentine traditions, literature and folk music was an important force during the 19th century, including composers Alberto Williams, JuliÃ¡n Aguirre, Arturo Berutti and Felipe Boero. In the 1930s, composers such as Juan Carlos Paz and Alberto Ginastera "began to espouse a cosmopolitan and modernist style, influenced by twelve-tone techniques and serialism"; while avant-garde music thrived by the 1960s, with the Rockefeller Foundation financing the Centro Interamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales, which brought internationally famous composers to work and teach in Buenos Aires, also establishing an electronic music studio.

<p>The RÃ­o de la Plata is known for being the birthplace of tango, which is considered an emblem of Buenos Aires. The city considers itself the Tango World Capital, and as such hosts many related events, the most important being an annual festival and world tournament. The most important exponent of the genre is Carlos Gardel, followed by AnÃ­bal Troilo; other important composers include Alfredo Gobbi, Ãstor Piazzolla, Osvaldo Pugliese, Mariano Mores, Juan D'Arienzo and Juan Carlos CobiÃ¡n. Tango music experienced a period of splendor during the 1940s, while in the 1960s and 1970s nuevo tango appeared, incorporating elements of classical and jazz music. A contemporary trend is neotango (also known as electrotango), with exponents such as Bajofondo and Gotan Project. On 30 September 2009, UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee of Intangible Heritage declared tango part of the world's cultural heritage, making Argentina eligible to receive financial assistance in safeguarding tango for future generations.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">98</span></p><p>The city hosts several music festivals every year. A popular genre is electronic dance music, with festivals including Creamfields BA, SAMC, Moonpark, and a local edition of Ultra Music Festival. Other well-known events include the Buenos Aires Jazz Festival, Personal Fest, Quilmes Rock and Pepsi Music. Some music festivals are held in Greater Buenos Aires, like Lollapalooza, which takes place at the HipÃ³dromo de San Isidro in San Isidro.

<p>Argentine cinema history began in Buenos Aires with the first film exhibition on 18 July 1896 at the Teatro OdeÃ³n. With his 1897 film, <i>La bandera Argentina</i>, EugÃ¨ne Py became one of the first filmmakers of the country; the film features a waving Argentine flag located at Plaza de Mayo. In the early 20th century, the first cinema theatres of the country opened in Buenos Aires, and newsreels appeared, most notably <i>El Viaje de Campos Salles a Buenos Aires</i>. The real industry emerged with the advent of sound films, the first one being <i>MuÃ±equitas porteÃ±as</i> (1931). The newly founded Argentina Sono Film released <i>Â¡Tango!</i> in 1933, the first integral sound production in the country. During the 1930s and the 1940s (commonly referred as the "Golden Age" of Argentine ciema), many films revolved around the city of Buenos Aires and tango culture, reflected in titles such as <i>La vida es un tango</i>, <i>El alma del bandoneÃ³n</i>, <i>AdiÃ³s Buenos Aires</i>, <i>El Cantor de Buenos Aires</i> and <i>Buenos Aires canta</i>. Argentine films were exported across Latin America, specially Libertad Lamarque's melodramas, and the comedies of Luis Sandrini and NinÃ­ Marshall. The popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music. Carlos Gardel, an iconic figure of tango and Buenos Aires, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.

<p>In response to large studio productions, the "Generation of the 60s" appeared, a group of filmmakers that produced the first modernist films in Argentina during that early years of that decade. These included Manuel AntÃ­n, Lautaro MurÃºa and RenÃ© Mugica, among others. During the second half of the decade, films of social protest were presented in clandestine exhibitions, the work of Grupo Cine LiberaciÃ³n and Grupo Cine de la Base, who advocated what they called "Third Cinema". At that time, the country was under a military dictatorship after the coup d'Ã©tat known as Argentine Revolution. One of the most notable films of these movement is <i>La hora de los hornos</i> (1968) by Fernando Solanas. During the period of democracy between 1973 and 1975, the local cinema experienced critical and commercial success, with titles including <i>Juan Moreira</i> (1973), <i>La Patagonia rebelde</i> (1974), <i>La Raulito</i> (1975), and <i>La tregua</i> (1974) â€“ which became the first Argentine film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. However, because of censorship and a new military government, Argentine cinema stalled until the return of democracy in the 1980s. This generation â€“ known as "Argentine Cinema in Liberty and Democracy" â€“ were mostly young or postponed filmmakers, and gained international notoriety. <i>Camila</i> (1984) by MarÃ­a Luisa Bemberg was nominated for the Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards, and Luis Puenzo's <i>La historia oficial</i> (1985) was the first Argentine film to receive the award.

<p>Buenos Aires' inhabitants have been historically characterized as "fashion-conscious". National designers display their collections annually at the Buenos Aires Fashion Week (BAFWEEK) and related events. Inevitably being a season behind, it fails to receive much international attention. Nevertheless, the city remains an important regional fashion capital. According to Global Language Monitor, as of 2017 the city is the 20th leading fashion capital in the world, ranking second in Latin America after Rio de Janeiro. In 2005, Buenos Aires was appointed as the first UNESCO City of Design, and received this title once again in 2007.

An increasing number of young, independent designers are also setting up their own shops in the bohemian neighbourhood of San Telmo, known for its wide variety of markets and antique shops. Recoleta, on the other hand, is the quintessential neighbourhood for exclusive and upscale fashion houses.

The city's characteristic convergence of diverse architectural styles can be seen, including Spanish Colonial, Beaux-Arts and modernist architecture.</div></div></div>
<p>Buenos Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling Paris and Madrid. There is a mix, due to immigration, of Colonial, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and French Bourbon styles. Italian and French influences increased after the declaration of independence at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">105</span></p><p>Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several buildings of Buenos Aires such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge; the Palace of Justice, the National Congress, all of them by Vittorio Meano, and the Teatro ColÃ³n, by Francesco Tamburini and Vittorio Meano.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">106</span></p><p>The simplicity of the <i>Rioplatense</i> baroque style can be clearly seen in Buenos Aires through the works of Italian architects such as AndrÃ© Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Pilar, the Cathedral and the Cabildo.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">107</span></p><p>In 1912, the Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento was opened to the public. Totally built by the generous donation of Mrs. Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena, Argentina's most prominent family, the church is an excellent example of French neo-classicism. With extremely high-grade decorations in its interior, the magnificent Mutin-CavaillÃ© coll organ (the biggest ever installed in an Argentine church with more than four-thousand tubes and four manuals) presided the nave. The altar is full of marble, and was the biggest ever built in South America at that time.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">108</span></p><p>In 1919, the construction of Palacio Barolo began. This was South America's tallest building at the time, and was the first Argentine skyscraper built with concrete (1919â€“1923). The building was equipped with 9 elevators, plus a 20-metre high lobby hall with paintings in the ceiling and Latin phrases embossed in golden bronze letters. A 300,000-candela beacon was installed at the top (110 m), making the building visible even from Uruguay. In 2009, the Barolo Palace went under an exhausive restoration, and the beacon was made operational again.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">109</span></p><p>In 1936, the Kavanagh building was inaugurated, with 120 metres (390 feet) height, 12 elevators (provided by Otis) and the world's first central air-conditioning system (provided by north-American company "Carrier"), is still an architectural landmark in Buenos Aires.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">110</span></p><p>The architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued to reproduce French neoclassic models, such as the headquarters of the Banco de la NaciÃ³n Argentina built by Alejandro Bustillo, and the Museo Hispanoamericano de Buenos Aires of MartÃ­n Noel. However, since the 1930s, the influence of Le Corbusier and European rationalism consolidated in a group of young architects from the University of TucumÃ¡n, among whom Amancio Williams stands out. The construction of skyscrapers proliferated in Buenos Aires until the 1950s. Newer modern high-technology buildings by Argentine architects in the last years of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st include the Le Parc Tower by Mario Ãlvarez, the Torre Fortabat by SÃ¡nchez ElÃ­a and the Repsol-YPF tower by CÃ©sar Pelli.

<p>Secondary education in Argentina is called <i>Polimodal</i> ("polymodal", that is, having multiple modes), since it allows the student to choose their orientation. Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation, among these five: <i>Humanities and Social Sciences</i>, <i>Economics and Management of Organizations</i>,<i> Art and Design</i>, <i>Health and Sport</i> and <i>Biology and Natural Sciences</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">113</span></p><p>Nevertheless, in Buenos Aires, secondary education consists of 5 years, called from 1st year to 5th year, as opposed to primary education's 1st to 7th grade. Most schools don't require students to choose their orientation, as they study the basic such as maths, biology, art, history and technology, but there are schools that do, whether they are orientated to a certain profession or they have orientations to choose from when they reach a specific year.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">114</span></p><p>Some high schools depend on the University of Buenos Aires, and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school. These high schools are ILSE, CNBA, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini and Escuela de EducaciÃ³n TÃ©cnica Profesional en ProducciÃ³n Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agri-food Production). The last two do have a specific orientation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">115</span></p><p>In December 2006 the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Congress passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years. The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">118</span></p><p>Visitors have many options such as going to a tango show, an estancia in the Province of Buenos Aires, or enjoying the traditional asado. New tourist circuits have recently evolved, devoted to famous Argentines such as Carlos Gardel, Eva PerÃ³n or Jorge Luis Borges. Before 2011, due to the favourable exchange rate, its shopping centres such as Alto Palermo, Paseo Alcorta, Patio Bullrich, Abasto de Buenos Aires and GalerÃ­as PacÃ­fico were frequently visited by tourists. The exchange rate today has hampered tourism and shopping in particular. Notable consumer brands such as Burberry and Louis Vuitton have abandoned the country due to the exchange rate and import restrictions. The city also plays host to musical festivals, some of the largest of which are Quilmes Rock, Creamfields BA, Ultra Music Festival (Buenos Aires) and the Buenos Aires Jazz Festival.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">119</span></p><p>The most popular tourist sites are found in the historic core of the city, in the Montserrat and San Telmo neighborhoods. Buenos Aires was conceived around the Plaza de Mayo, the colony's administrative center. To the east of the square is the <i>Casa Rosada</i>, the official seat of the executive branch of the government of Argentina. To the north, the <i>Catedral Metropolitana</i> which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the Banco de la NaciÃ³n Argentina building, a parcel of land originally owned by Juan de Garay. Other important colonial institutions were Cabildo, to the west, which was renovated during the construction of Avenida de Mayo and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the <i>Congreso de la NaciÃ³n</i> (National Congress), which currently houses the <i>Academia Nacional de la Historia</i> (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.

<p>Buenos Aires has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city's eastern side in the Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo and Belgrano neighbourhoods. Some of the most important are:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">121</span></p>
<ul><li>Parque Tres de Febrero, designed by urbanist JordÃ¡n Czeslaw Wysocki and architect Julio Dormal, the park was inaugurated on 11 November 1875. The dramatic economic growth of Buenos Aires afterwards helped to lead to its transfer to the municipal domain in 1888, whereby French Argentine urbanist Carlos Thays was commissioned to expand and further beautify the park, between 1892 and 1912. Thays designed the Zoological Gardens, the Botanical Gardens, the adjoining Plaza Italia and the Rose Garden.</li>
<li>Botanical Gardens, designed by French architect and landscape designer Carlos Thays, the garden was inaugurated on 7 September 1898. Thays and his family lived in an English style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.</li>
<li>Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens Is the largest of its type in the World, outside Japan. Completed in 1967, the gardens were inaugurated on occasion of a State visit to Argentina by Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan.</li>
<li>Plaza de Mayo Since being the scene of 25 May 1810 revolution that led to independence, the plaza has been a hub of political life in Argentina.</li>
<li>Plaza San MartÃ­n is a park located in the Retiro neighbourhood of the city. Situated at the northern end of pedestrianized Florida Street, the park is bounded by Libertador Ave. (N), MaipÃº St. (W), Santa Fe Avenue (S), and Leandro Alem Av. (E).</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gay_tourism">Gay tourism</span></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires has become a recipient of LGBT tourism, due to the existence of some gay-friendly sites and the legalising of same-sex marriage on 15 July 2010, making it the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth in the world to do so. Its <i>Gender Identity Law</i>, passed in 2012, made Argentina the "only country that allows people to change their gender identities without facing barriers such as hormone therapy, surgery or psychiatric diagnosis that labels them as having an abnormality". In 2015, the World Health Organization cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. Despite these legal advances, however, homophobia continues to be a hotly contested social issue in the city and the country.

Establishments of a higher category typically enjoy the city's highest occupation rates. The majority of the hotels are located in the central part of the city, within close proximity to most main tourist attractions.

<ul><li>Cabildo was used as the government house during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate. The original building was finished in 1610 but was soon found to be too small and had to be expanded. Over the years many changes have been made. In 1940, the architect Mario Buschiazzo reconstructed the colonial features of the Cabildo using various original documents.</li>
<li>Kavanagh building is located at 1065 Florida St. in the barrio of Retiro, overlooking Plaza San MartÃ­n. It was constructed in the 1930s in the Rationalist style, by the architects Gregorio SÃ¡nchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis MarÃ­a de la Torre and was finished in 1936. The building is characterised by the austerity of its lines, the lack of external ornamentation and its large prismatic volumes. It was declared a national historical monument in 1999, and is one of the most impressive architectural masterpieces of Buenos Aires. Standing at a height of 120 m, it still retains its impact against the modern skyline of the city. In 1939 its faÃ§ade received an award from the American Institute of Architects.</li>
<li>Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Catholic church in Buenos Aires. It is located in the city centre, overlooking Plaza de Mayo, on the corner of San MartÃ­n and Rivadavia streets, in the San NicolÃ¡s neighbourhood. It is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>National Library is the largest library in Argentina and one of the most important in the Americas.</li>
<li>The Obelisk was built in May 1936 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first founding of the city. It is located in the center of the <i>Plaza de la RepÃºblica</i> (Republic Square), the spot where the Argentine flag was flown for the first time in Buenos Aires, at the intersection of Nueve de Julio and Corrientes avenues. Its total height is 67 meters (220 feet) and its base area is 49 square meters (530 square feet). It was designed by architect Alberto Prebisch, and its construction took barely four weeks.</li>

<p>The Ministro Pistarini International Airport, commonly known as <i>Ezeiza Airport</i>, is located in the suburb of Ezeiza approximately 22Â km south of the city. This airport handles most international air traffic to and from Argentina as well as some domestic flights.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">134</span></p><p>The Aeroparque Jorge Newbery airport, located in the Palermo district of the city next to the riverbank, serves primarily domestic traffic within Argentina and some regional flights to neighboring South American countries. The El Palomar Airport in the suburb of El Palomar is 18Â km west of the city and also handles some scheduled domestic flights to a number of destinations in Argentina. A smaller San Fernando Airport serves only general aviation.

<p>Buenos Aires is based on a square, rectangular grid pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (notably, the neighbourhood of Parque Chas). The rectangular grid provides for square blocks named <i>manzanas</i>, with a length of roughly 110 metres (361 feet). Pedestrian zones in the city centre, like Florida Street are partially car-free and always bustling, access provided by bus and the Underground (subte) Line C. Buenos Aires, for the most part, is a very walkable city and the majority of residents in Buenos Aires use public transport.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">136</span></p><p>Two diagonal avenues in the city centre alleviate traffic and provide better access to Plaza de Mayo. Most avenues running into and out of the city centre are one-way and feature six or more lanes, with computer-controlled green waves to speed up traffic outside of peak times.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">137</span></p><p>The city's principal avenues include the 140-metre (459Â ft)-wide July 9 Avenue, the over-35Â km (22Â mi)-long Rivadavia Avenue, and Corrientes Avenue, the main thoroughfare of culture and entertainment.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">138</span></p><p>In the 1940s and 1950s the General Paz Avenue beltway that surrounds the city along its border with Buenos Aires Province, and the freeways leading to the new international airport and to the northern suburbs, heralded a new era for Buenos Aires traffic. Encouraged by pro-automaker policies that were pursued towards the end of the PerÃ³n (1955) and Frondizi administrations (1958â€“62) in particular, auto sales nationally grew from an average of 30,000 during the 1920â€“57 era to around 250,000 in the 1970s and over 600,000 in 2008. Today, over 1.8Â million vehicles (nearly one-fifth of Argentina's total) are registered in Buenos Aires.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">139</span></p><p>Toll motorways opened in the late 1970s by mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore provided fast access to the city centre and are today used by over a million vehicles daily. Cacciatore likewise had financial district streets (roughly one square km in area) closed to private cars during daytime. Most major avenues are, however, gridlocked at peak hours. Following the economic mini-boom of the 1990s, record numbers started commuting by car and congestion increased, as did the time-honored Argentine custom of taking weekends off in the countryside.

<p>The Buenos Aires commuter rail system has seven lines:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">141</span></p>
<div class="div-col columns column-width" style="-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em;">

<li>San MartÃ­n Line</li>
<li>Sarmiento Line</li>
<li>Mitre Line</li>
<li>Urquiza Line</li></ul>
</div>
<p>The Buenos Aires commuter network system is very extensive: every day more than 1.3Â million people commute to the Argentine capital. These suburban trains operate between 4Â am and 1Â am. The Buenos Aires commuter rail network also connects the city with long-distance rail services to Rosario and CÃ³rdoba, among other metropolitan areas. There are four principal terminals for both long-distance and local passenger services in the city centre: Constitucion, Retiro, Federico Lacroze and Once, while Buenos Aires station is a minor terminus.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">142</span></p><p>Commuter rail in the city is mostly operated by the state-owned Trenes Argentinos, though the Urquiza Line and Belgrano Norte Line are operated by private companies MetrovÃ­as and FerrovÃ­as respectively. All services had been operated by Ferrocarriles Argentinos until the company's privatisation in 1993, and were then operated by a series of private companies until the lines were put back under state control following a series of high-profile accidents.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">143</span></p><p>Since 2013, there has been a series of large investments on the network, with all lines (with the exception of the Urquiza Line) receiving new rolling stock, along with widespread infrastructure improvements, track replacement, electrification work, refurbishments of stations and building entirely new stations. Similarly, almost all level crossings have been replaced by underpasses and overpasses in the city, with plans to replace all of them in the near future. One of the most major projects under way is the electrification of the remaining segments of the Roca Line â€“ the most widely used in the network â€“ and also moving the entire section of the Sarmiento Line which runs through the centre of the city underground to allow for better frequencies on the line and reduce congestion above ground.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">144</span></p><p>There are also three other major projects on the table. The first would elevate a large segment of the San MartÃ­n Line which runs through the centre of the city and electrify the line, while the second would see the electrification and extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion station in the centre of the city. If these two projects are completed, then the Belgrano Norte Line would be the only diesel line to run through the city. The third and most ambitious is to build a series of underground tunnels between three of the city's railway terminals with a large underground central station underneath the Obelisk, connecting all the commuter railway lines in a network dubbed the Red de Expresos Regionales.

<p>In December 2010, the city government launched a bicycle sharing program with bicycles free for hire upon registration. Located in mostly central areas, there are 31 rental stations throughout the city providing over 850 bicycles to be picked up and dropped off at any station within an hour. As of 2013, the city has constructed 110Â km (68.35Â mi) of protected bicycle lanes and has plans to construct another 100Â km (62.14Â mi). In 2015, the stations were automated and the service became 24 hours through use of a smart card or mobile phone application.

<p>The Buenos Aires Underground (locally known as <i>subte</i>, from <i>"subterrÃ¡neo"</i> meaning underground or subway), is a high-yield system providing access to various parts of the city. Opened in 1913, it is the oldest underground system in the Southern Hemisphere and oldest in the Spanish-speaking world. The system has six underground lines and one overground line, named by letters (A to E, and H) and there are 100 stations, and 58.8Â km (37Â mi) of route, including the Premetro line. An expansion program is underway to extend existing lines into the outer neighborhoods and add a new north-south line. Route length is expected to reach 89Â km (55Â mi) by 2011.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">147</span></p><p>Line A is the oldest one (service opened to public in 1913) and stations kept the "belle-Ã©poque" decoration, while the original rolling stock from 1913, affectionately known as <i>Las Brujas</i> were retired from the line in 2013.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Trams in Buenos Aires</div>
<p>Buenos Aires had an extensive street railway (tram) system with over 857Â km (533Â mi) of track, which was dismantled during the 1960s in favour of bus transportation, but surface rail transport has made a small comeback in some parts of the city. The PreMetro or Line E2 is a 7.4Â km (4.6Â mi) light rail line that connects with Underground Line E at Plaza de los Virreyes station and runs to General Savio and Centro CÃ­vico. It is operated by MetrovÃ­as. The official inauguration took place on 27 August 1987.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">150</span></p><p>A 2Â km (1.2Â mi) modern tramway, the TranvÃ­a del Este, opened in 2007 in the Puerto Madero district, using two tramcars on temporary loan. However, plans to extend the line and acquire a fleet of trams did not come to fruition, and declining patronage led to the line's closure in October 2012.  A heritage streetcar maintained by tram fans operates on weekends, near the Primera Junta line A Underground station in the Caballito neighbourhood.

<p>There are over 150 city bus lines called <i>Colectivos</i>, each one managed by an individual company. These compete with each other, and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support. Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system. Colectivos in Buenos Aires do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day. With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">152</span></p><p>Buenos Aires has recently opened a bus rapid transit system, the Metrobus. The system uses modular median stations that serve both directions of travel, which enable pre-paid, multiple-door, level boarding. The first line, opened on 31 May 2011, runs across the Juan B. Justo Ave has 21 stations. The system now has 4 lines with 113 stations on its 43.5Â km (27.0Â mi) network, while numerous other lines are under construction and planned.
