<p>In the <b>New Testament</b> (NT), there are at least three passages that refer to <b>homosexual activity</b>: Romans 1:26â€“27, 1 Corinthians 6:9â€“10, and 1 Timothy 1:9â€“10. A fourth passage, Jude 1:7, is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality. Jesus discusses marriage only in a heterosexual context when he cites the Book of Genesis during a discussion of marriage (Matthew 19:4-6 and Mark 10:6-9).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>The references to homosexuality itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Greek words: <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> (á¼€ÏÏƒÎµÎ½Î¿ÎºÎ¿Î¯Ï„Î·Ï‚), <i>malakos</i> (Î¼Î±Î»Î±ÎºÏŒÏ‚), and <i>porneia</i> (Ï€Î¿ÏÎ½ÎµÎ¯Î±) and its cognates.  While it is not disputed that the three Greek words apply to sexual relations between men (and possibly between women), some academics interpret the relevant passages as a prohibition against pederasty or prostitution rather than homosexuality <i>per se</i>, while other scholars have presented counter arguments.  The historical context of the passages has also been a subject of debate.

<p>The context is Paul's mission to the gentiles, the gospel being "to the Jew first, and also to the Greek" (1:16), followed by a description of pagan idolatry in verses 1:21â€“25. The phrase "passions of dishonor" (KJV: "vile affections") translates <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Ï€Î¬Î¸Î· á¼€Ï„Î¹Î¼Î¯Î±Ï‚</span>,
<span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">á¼€Ï„Î¹Î¼Î¯Î±</span> <i>atimia</i> meaning "dishonour, ignominy, disgrace").
In the expressions "natural use" and "contrary to nature", "nature" translates Ï†ÏÏƒÎ¹Ï‚, i.e. <i>Physis</i>. The term "error" translates <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Ï€Î»Î¬Î½Î·</span> <i>planÄ“</i> (lit. "straying, wandering")
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The authenticity of the passage is in doubt; several scholars since the mid-20th century have proposed their being part of a larger non-Pauline interpolation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_law">Natural law</span></h4>
<p>The authors of the New Testament had their roots in the Jewish tradition, in which homosexuality is prohibited.(Leviticus 18:27) A more conservative biblical interpretation contends "the most authentic reading of Rom 1:26-7 is that which sees it prohibiting homosexual activity in the most general of terms, rather than in respect of more culturally and historically specific forms of such activity".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Several early church writersstate that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. Underlying Paul's thinking is Genesis 2:22-24, "The Lord God then built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman. When he brought her to the man, the man said: â€œThis one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; ...That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body." For Paul, Godâ€™s intended order is for male and female sexual relationships, united in marriage. That is what he saw as natural, and therefore same sex relationships were unnatural. In 1 Romans, Paul is giving examples of what happens when people abandon Godâ€™s plan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>The passage has been described by David Hilborn of the Evangelical Alliance as "the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate". In common with many traditional commentators, Hilborn goes on to argue that condemnation of homosexual activity is derived from the "broad contours" of Paul's argument, in addition to the selective reading of individual words or phrases.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Boswell (1980) speculated that the text does not condemn "homosexual acts by homosexuals", but rather "homosexual acts committed by heterosexual persons". Boswell argues that the conceptual modality (natural laws) which would provide the basis for the blanket condemnation of homosexuality did not exist prior to the Enlightenment era. Hays argues that Romans 1:26,27 is part of a general condemnation of humans, in which males and females, have rejected their creational (as in Genesis) distinctions, with homoeroticism being intrinsically wrong.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>McNeill (1993) also invokes "heterosexuals" who "abandoned heterosexuality" or "exchanged heterosexuality for homosexuality".
Dallas (), opposing what he sees as "pro-gay theology" behind such interpretations, contends that the apostle Paul is condemning changing "the natural use into that which is against nature" (Romans 1:26-27), and to suggest that Paul is referring to "heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Idolatrous_practices">Idolatrous practices</span></h4>
<p>Jeramy Townsley goes on to specify the context of Rom 1:26-27 as the continuation of Paul's condemnation of the worship of pagan gods from earlier in the chapter, linking the 'homosexuality' implied in Rom 1:27 to the practice of temple prostitution with castrated priests of Cybele, practices condemned more explicitly in the Old Testament (1 Kings 15:12, 2 Kings 23:7), the same religious group that violently attacked Paul in Ephesus, driving him from the city (Acts 19).  The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Rom 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians. Mona West () argues that Paul is condemning specific types of homosexual activity (such as temple prostitution or pederasty) rather than a broader interpretation. West argues that Paul is speaking to a Gentile audience in terms that they would understand to show that "all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1_Corinthians_6:9-10">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</span></h3>
<p>King James Version (1611): "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The phrase "abusers of themselves with mankind" translates <i>arsenokoitai</i> also rendered "sodomites" (YLT), or "men who have sex with men" (NIV). Paul's use of the word in 1 Corinthians is the earliest example of the term; its only other usage is in a similar list of wrongdoers given (possibly by the same author) in 1 Timothy 1:8â€“11. The term rendered as "effeminate" is <i>malakoi</i>, with a literal meaning of "soft". Nowhere else in scripture is malakoi used to describe a person.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>These verses are a continuation of Pauls' berating the Christians at Corinth for suing one another before pagan judges in Roman courts, which he sees as an infringement upon the holiness of the Christian community. Paul lists a catalogue of typical vices that exclude from the kingdom of God; vices that the church members either practiced and would still be practicing but for the fact they are now Christians. They ought to be able to settle minor disputes within the community. Above all, they ought to deal with each other in charity.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1_Timothy_1:9-10">1 Timothy 1:9-10</span></h3>
<p>King James Version (1611): "Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The term relevant to homosexuality, "that defile themselves with mankind", translates á¼€ÏÏƒÎµÎ½Î¿ÎºÎ¿Î¯Ï„Î·Ï‚ <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i>, the same term for homosexuals used in 1 Corinthians.
Other translations of the term include: "them that do lechery with men" (Wycliffe 1382), "those practicing homosexuality" (NIV), "those who abuse themselves with men" (Amplified Version, 1987).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Since the nineteenth century many scholars have suggested that First Timothy, along with Second Timothy and Titus, are not original to Paul, but rather an unknown Christian writing some time in the late-first-to-mid-2nd century. Most scholars now affirm this view.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Jude_1:7">Jude 1:7</span></h2>
<p>"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." (KJV)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>The expression of "giving themselves over to fornication" translates <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">á¼ÎºÏ€Î¿ÏÎ½ÎµÏÏƒÎ±ÏƒÎ±Î¹</span> <i>ekporneusasai</i>, rendered as "sexual immorality" in both NIV and ESV; the phrase "going after strange flesh" is a literal translation of <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">á¼€Ï€ÎµÎ»Î¸Î¿á¿¦ÏƒÎ±Î¹ á½€Ï€Î¯ÏƒÏ‰ ÏƒÎ±ÏÎºá½¸Ï‚ á¼‘Ï„Î­ÏÎ±Ï‚</span>, rendered as "perversion" in NIV and as "pursued unnatural desire" in ESV.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Simon J. Kistemaker notes that the Greek phrase ÏƒÎ±ÏÎºá½¸Ï‚ á¼‘Ï„Î­ÏÎ±Ï‚ (<i>sarkos heteras</i>, "strange flesh") is often interpreted as the specific desire on the part of the Sodomites to have sexual relations with angels.
Kistemaker, however, argues that it means they were "interested in sexual relations with men."

<h2><span id="Jesus.27_discussion_of_marriage"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Jesus'_discussion_of_marriage">Jesus' discussion of marriage</span></h2><p>
In Matthew 19:3, Jesus is asked "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?" His answer is as follows:<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><blockquote><p>He answered, "Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning 'made them male and female' [Genesis 1:27], and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh' [Genesis 2:24]? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p></blockquote><p>Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is "obvious" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he "presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Leroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for "many" reasons, or for "any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is "likely" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to "Be fruitful and multiply." Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is "more radical and less permissive".

<p>In contrast, Boswell (1980) argues that this is a term specifically created by Paul, and that given its unusual nature, the fact that Paul did not use one of the more common pagan Greek terms, and given its direct reference to the Levitical laws, it is a matter of debate whether Paul was referring generally to any person having homosexual sex, or whether (as discussed below) it referred only to anal sex of any form (cf. Elliott 2004). Other translations of the word, based on examinations of the context of its subsequent uses, include Martin's (1996), who argued it meant "homosexual slave trader" and Boswell's (1980) who argued it referred to "homosexual rape" or homosexual prostitutes.  Scroggs perceives it as referring to exploitative pederasty.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>The term <i>arsenokoitai</i> was rarely used in Church writings (Elliott 1994), with Townsley (2003) counting a total of 73 references. Most are ambiguous in nature, although St. John Chrysostom, in the 4th century, seems to use the term <i>arsenokoitai</i> to refer to pederasty common in the Greco-Roman culture of the time and Patriarch John IV of Constantinople in the 6th century used it to refer to anal sex: "some men even commit the sin of <i>arsenokoitai</i> with their wives" (Townsley 2003). Moreover, Hippolytus of Rome in his <i>Refutation of all Heresies</i> describes a Gnostic teaching, according to which an evil angel Naas committed adultery with Eve and <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> with Adam. The context suggests the translation of <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> as pederasty, although it might have a different meaning.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Arguments_for_a_reference_to_homosexual_behaviour">Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour</span></h4>
<p>Some scholars argue against the restriction of the word to pederasty. For example, Scobie states that "there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations". Similarly, Campbell writes, "it must be pointed out, first, that <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse." Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, "in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">30</span></p><p>Others have pointed out that the meaning of <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> is identified by its derivation from the Greek translation of the Old Testament, where the component words "with a man (<i>arsenos</i>) do not copulate coitus (<i>koites</i>) as with a woman" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for "one who lies with a male [as with a woman]" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of <i>Sybilline Oracles</i> 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct. Malick (<i>op cit</i>) writes, "it is significant that of all the terms available in the Greek language, Paul chose a compound from the Septuagint that in the broadest sense described men lying with men as they would lie with women." According to Scobie, "it clearly echoes the Greek of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the LXX (arsen = "male," and koite = "bed"), so that arsenokoitÄ“s literally means "one who goes to bed with a male".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>David Wright argues that the compound word refers to those who sleep with males, and denotes â€œâ€˜male homosexual activityâ€™ without qualification.â€ Haas, reviewing the various arguments on both sides, concluded that "an examination of the biblical passages from linguistic, historical and ethical-theological perspectives fails to support the revisionist ethic and reinforces the traditional Christian teaching that homosexual practice is morally wrong." Via also agrees <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i> refers to homosexual activity. James B. De Young presents similar arguments.

<p>The Greek word <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Î¼Î±Î»Î±ÎºÏŒÏ‚</span>; <i>malakos</i> carries a root meaning of soft, luxurious or dainty, but here, G. Fee argues, it is used in a much darker way, possibly referring to the more passive partner in a homosexual relationship. According to Scroggs (<i>op cit</i>), the word <i>malakos</i> in Paulâ€™s list refers specifically to this category of person, the effeminate call-boy. Others, for example Olson, based on previous and subsequent uses of the term, interprets <i>malakos</i> to mean an effeminate but not necessarily homosexual man. Olson argues that the Î¼Î±Î»Î±ÎºÎ¿Î¯ in Paulâ€™s time, "almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'."

<p>Lexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (<i>op cit</i>) writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter from Demophon, a wealthy Egyptian, to Ptolemaeus, a police official, concerning needed provisions for a coming festival. According to Ukleja, "a strong possible translation of both <i>malakos</i> (and <i>arsenokoitÄ“s</i>) is the morally loose (effeminate) who allow themselves to be used homosexually and the person who is a practicing homosexual." Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>The meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (<i>op cit</i>), when <i>malakos</i> is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships. Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>Standard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. Most scholars think it means someone wilfully engaged in homosexual relations.

<p>Whether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of <i>porneia</i> (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate <i>porneia</i> as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see Leviticus). Some interpret the translation of <i>porneia</i> more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the Church Fathers.

<p>This event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a centurion's servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: "There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die." The term translated from the Greek as "servant" in this verse is <i>doulos</i>. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is <i>pais</i>, a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including "child" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), "son" (John 4:51) or "servant" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether "son" or "servant" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">46</span></p><p>Horner and Daniel A. Helminiak both suggest a homosexual theme to this text. Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term "valued highly" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him. However, a contrasting viewpoint is that the term â€œhighly valuedâ€ (Greek á¼”Î½Ï„Î¹Î¼Î¿Ï‚, <i>entimos</i>) simply suggests a genuine care for the person or, more archaically, that the centurion was fond of this slave, and that the term <i>entimos</i> has no hint of sexual content in any of its various appearances in the Bible. Jay Michaelson argues that the term <i>pais</i> is actually mistranslated as <i>servant</i> when its true meaning is <i>lover</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">47</span></p><p>Other biblical scholars dismiss any suggestions of a homosexual theme as deliberately distorted interpretations of the text. Marston argues that Jesus would not have condoned any homosexual relationship, in line with the weight of other scriptural evidence, while Chapman suggests that even if the relationship had been homosexual, his lack of condemnation does not necessarily equate to his approval of them.

Most interpreters assume that, due to the analogy with same-sex lust between males, Paul is referring to female same-sex behavior. This assumption is not conclusive, and it remains difficult to discern exactly what Paul meant by women exchanging natural intercourse for unnatural.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_and_cultural_issues">Historical and cultural issues</span></h2>
<p>Many commentators have argued that the references to homosexuality in the NT, or the Bible in general, have to be understood in their proper historical context. Indeed, most interpreters come to the text with a preconceived notion of what the Bible has to say about normative sexual behaviors, influencing subsequent interpretations. For example, William Walker says that the very notion of "homosexuality" (or even "heterosexuality", "bisexuality" and "sexual orientation") is essentially a modern concept that would simply have been unintelligible to the New Testament writers. The word "homosexuality" and the concept of sexual orientation as being separate from one's perceived masculinity or femininity (i.e. gender identity) did not take shape until the 19th century. Moreover, although some ancient Romans (i.e. doctors, astrologers, etc.) discussed congenital inclinations to unconventional sexual activities such as homosexuality, this classification fails to correspond to a modern psychological, biological and genetic distinction between homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientations. However, according to Gagnon, the concept of homosexual orientation was not wholly unknown in the Greco-Roman milieu. Moreover, he asserts that there is absolutely no evidence that modern orientation theory would have had any impact on Paul changing his strong negative valuation of homosexual practice.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>A statement by the Bishops of the Church of England (Issues in Human Sexuality) in 1991 illustrates a categorization and understanding of homosexuality, claiming that in ancient times "society recognized the existence of those, predominantly male, who appeared to be attracted entirely to members of their own sex." (Issues in Human Sexuality para 2.16, lines 8-9) which almost parallels that of modern ideation. The same study is careful to point out that "the modern concept of orientation has been developed against a background of genetic and psychological theory which was not available to the ancient world."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>Sarah Ruden, in her <i>Paul Among the People</i> (2010) argues that the only form of homosexual sex that was apparent to the public in Paul's time was exploitative pederasty, in which slave boys were raped by adult males, often very violently. Paul's condemnation of homosexuality, Ruden argues, can be interpreted most plausibly as a criticism of this kind of brutally exploitative behavior.
