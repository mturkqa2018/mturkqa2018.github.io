His commanding presence in goal and aggressive style earned him nicknames such as <i>Der Titan</i> (<small></small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[deËÉÌ¯ tiËtaËn]</span>, English: <span lang="en">the Titan</span>) from the press and <i>Vol-kahn-o</i> ("volcano") from fans.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Kahn is one of the most successful German players in recent history, having won eight Bundesliga titles, six DFB-Pokals, the UEFA Cup in 1996, the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup, both achieved in 2001. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, his individual contributions have earned him a record four consecutive UEFA Best European Goalkeeper awards, as well as three IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper awards, and two German Footballer of the Year trophies. At the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Kahn became the only goalkeeper in the tournament's history to win the Golden Ball. Kahn placed fifth in both the IFFHS Best Goalkeeper of the 21st Century and Best Goalkeeper of the Past 25 Years elections.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>From 1994 to 2006, Kahn was part of the German national team, in which he played as a starter after the retirement of Andreas KÃ¶pke; he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, although Germany was not among the tournament favourites, Kahn's prowess in goal was key to reaching the final, where Germany lost 0â2 to Brazil and Kahn made a mistake on Brazil's first goal, nonetheless he received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Karlsruher_SC">Karlsruher SC</span></h3>
<p>At the age of six, Kahn joined Karlsruher SC, where his father Rolf had played from 1962 to 1965. He started as an outfield player before becoming goalkeeper. Kahn was included in the team's professional squad in the 1987â88 season of the first Bundesliga division, at first being the reserve goalkeeper behind Alexander Famulla. On 27 November 1987, Kahn made his league debut in a 4â0 away defeat to 1. FC KÃ¶ln. However, not until 1990 did manager Winfried SchÃ¤fer decide to start him over Famulla. In the following years, Kahn established himself as the team's starting goalkeeper. He was considered a key player and a motivator in the Karlsruher squad which reached the semi-finals in the 1993â94 UEFA Cup. During the round of sixteen the team accomplished a 7â0 rout of Valencia at its home field after losing the first match 1â3 at the Mestalla Stadium. The game was nicknamed the "Miracle at Wildparkstadion" by the German media. The team was defeated by SV Austria Salzburg in the semi-final.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bayern_Munich">Bayern Munich</span></h3>
<p>Kahn's performance for Karlsruher SC prompted Bayern Munich to express interest in acquiring him. The team signed him as a replacement for Raimond Aumann at the beginning of the 1994â95 season, for the at that time record fee of DM4.6Â million (â¬2.385Â million) for his position, and was established as Bayern's starting goalkeeper. Although suffering a rupture of his cruciate ligament, which kept him off the field for almost six months, Kahn made his debut match for the German national team two months after his return. Bayern defeated Bordeaux 3â1 in the 1996 UEFA Cup Final. In the 1996â97 Bundesliga season, Kahn achieved his first German championship with Bayern Munich, the German League Cup, and was named German Goalkeeper of the Year for the second time in his career (the first in 1994).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1999, Bayern Munich reached the 1999 Champions League Final, facing Manchester United at Camp Nou. Although Bayern Munich player Mario Basler scored an early goal in the sixth minute of the game, two goals by Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r in injury time led to United's victory. The same year, he was named World Goalkeeper of the Year by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Kahn was sent off in an incident against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001. With his Bayern Munich team losing 2â3 in the final minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, jumped up, and punched the ball into the opponent's net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. He was named man of the match when he was part of the squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia. He played an important role in the penalty shoot-out held after the teams remained tied 1â1 after extra time, making three saves. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after he walked up to a disappointed Santiago CaÃ±izares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to comfort him. The same year, Bayern Munich won the Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors. But the team failed to win the UEFA Super Cup a couple of months earlier.

<p>By Kahn's account, injuries, personal problems and a lack of motivation were responsible for his game going into a rapid decline during the 2002â03 season. This culminated with Kahn allowing a seemingly soft shot by Roberto Carlos into the net against Real Madrid in the first knockout-round of the 2003â04 Champions League season, contributing to the elimination of his team from the competition. The <i>Daily Mail</i> criticised him for his mistake: "Once again on the big occasion Kahn was undone by a Brazilian, just as he was in the 2002 World Cup Final. Only this time it was a Roberto Carlos free-kick which he let slip, not a Rivaldo shot, for a goal as embarrassing as it is potentially catastrophic for Bayern". Bayern Munich won the next Bundesliga season with Kahn.

<p>Prior to a 2006 match against Arminia Bielefeld in Munich, Michael Rensing peppered Kahn with practice shots. One shot hit Kahn squarely in the eye, causing enough swelling and discoloration to keep him from playing. With Rensing in goal, Bayern Munich won the match 2â0.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Kahn announced his intention to honour his contract and play through the 2007â08 season. As of 2011, he is the all time clean sheet leader in the history of the Bundesliga, with 197. On 2 September 2007, aged 38, he played his 535th Bundesliga match, becoming the league's all-time leader among goalkeepers in matches played. Kahn made his final European appearance for Bayern in a 4â0 defeat to Zenit Saint Petersburg in the UEFA cup semi-final on 1 May 2008. His last Bundesliga game was the 4â1 victory against Hertha Berlin on 17 May. It was his 557th appearance in the German top-flight.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>After a twenty-year career, of which he played fourteen with Bayern, he had his professional farewell in a testimonial match versus the select Germany XI on 2 September 2008, which ended 1â1. His last appearance for Bayern Munich was on 27 May 2008 at the Salt Lake Stadium (Yuvabharati Krirangan), Kolkata in a friendly against Mohun Bagan of India during Bayern's Asian tour of 2008. Around 120,000 people turned up for the match. The match ended 0â3 in favour of Bayern and Michael Rensing substituted him in the 55th minute.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="International_career">International career</span></h2>
<p>Kahn was initially called for the German national team as a late back-up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup; however he made his first international appearance on 23 June 1995 in a 2â1 victory against Switzerland, two months after recovering from his cruciate ligament injury. Along with Oliver Reck, Kahn was a reserve keeper of the squad, which won the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England.

<div class="quotebox-quote quoted left-aligned" style="">Oliver Kahn was recently asked if their was anyone who could tell him what to do. 'Who can?' he mused. 'The only thing which engages me is what I can do to be successful.' In other words, nobody can tell Bayern Munich's goalkeeper Oliver Kahn what to do. He is, and always has been, alone with his obsession to become the master of his chosen art.

<p>Kahn spent the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France on the bench, and it was not until Andreas KÃ¶pke announced his retirement at the end of the tournament that Kahn became the starting goalkeeper. Two years after the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship, in which defending champions Germany made an embarrassing exit in the group stage, Kahn received the squad's captaincy, succeeding the striker Oliver Bierhoff.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Kahn experienced one of his worst performances in his international career against England in Munich in 2001. Germany were favoured to win as they had beaten England 1â0 in 2000 at the Wembley Stadium. However, they were routed 5â1, including a hat-trick by Michael Owen. Despite the defeat, Germany qualified for the World Cup after winning a playoff against Ukraine, and Kahn remained as Germany's number one for the upcoming Cup. Kahn was named the best goalkeeper in the world by IFFHS for the second time in his career.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Despite Germany's comparatively low expectations when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team advanced to the finals; Kahn conceded only three goals in the course of the competition, two of which were in the Final. Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake. The FIFA Technical Study Group awarded him with the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament, while also edging out tournament top scorer Ronaldo to receive the Golden Ball for the best individual performance. Kahn is the only goalkeeper in World Cup history to win the Golden Ball, and also became the first German goalkeeper to keep five clean sheets in a World Cup tournament.

<p>Kahn maintained his number one spot for the 2004 UEFA European Football Championship, but Germany were once again eliminated in the group stage. Oliver Kahn gave up his captaincy to Michael Ballack after the tournament.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>Germany's new manager JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann, who replaced Rudi VÃ¶ller, adopted the strategy of rotating the number one spot between Kahn and his longtime competitor, Jens Lehmann of Arsenal, to stimulate competition between the two. On 7 April 2006, after two years of dispute for the position Klinsmann announced Lehmann was his first-choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup. Kahn decided to stay on as a backup for the competition; despite their acrimonious pre-tournament battle for Germany's starting role, Kahn openly accepted Klinsmann's decision. Kahn and Lehmann embraced and shook hands as the former offered words of encouragement before the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Argentina. In the postgame conference, Kahn publicly praised Lehmann for his two decisive penalty saves.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>After Germany was eliminated in the semi-finals by Italy, Kahn was given the start for the third place play-off held on 8 July 2006, which Germany won 3â1 against Portugal. In what was his last international appearance for Germany, he also received the captaincy of the team in the absence of the injured Michael Ballack. Although overshadowed by Bastian Schweinsteiger's game-winning performance in the match, Kahn played to a high standard, pulling off several saves. Kahn deflected a shot by Portuguese forward Pauleta after he beat the German defence, and later saved Deco's shot made from just inside the penalty area. Following the match, Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the German National Team. Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps for Germany, including 49 as team captain. He never won a World Cup, but finished as runner-up in 2002 and third in 2006.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Media">Media</span></h2>
<p>Due to his performances during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, Kahn gained popularity in Asia. He was depicted in several television commercials, including one for the Shinkin bank. In 2008, his wax figure in the Berlin branch of the Madame Tussaud museum was inaugurated. Kahn is the subject of the song <i>Olli Kahn</i> by the German pop group Die Prinzen.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>In 2015, the arcade game company Konami announced that Kahn would feature in their football video game <i>Pro Evolution Soccer 2016</i> as one of the new myClub Legends.

In 2009, he was part of the jury of a China Central Television reality show, which aimed to find China's best young goalkeeper. As of 2011, he started negotiations with television channel Sat.1 to introduce the same format to German television under the name <i>Never give up â The Kahn Principle</i>, in which the winner would receive a contract to play for a Bundesliga club.

<p>Kahn was born in Karlsruhe. He is partly of Latvian descent; his father Rolf was born in LiepÄja in 1943, where he remains well-known, to a Latvian mother, Ärika (nÃ©e Alksnis), and a Baltic German father, also named Rolf. Rolf briefly played professionally for Karlsruher SC, as did his son Axel, Oliver Kahn's older brother.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In 2009, he was offered the position of manager for the FC Schalke 04, which he turned down. Two years thereafter, in April 2011, a German court fined Kahn â¬125,000 ($182,223) for tax evasion after failing to declare more than â¬6,000 of luxury clothing he bought on a trip to Dubai.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>He supports the Munich street-football league <i>Bunt kickt gut</i>, which is considered a pioneer project of organised street-football and a Germany and Europa-wide model of intercultural understanding, education values and prevention; the Sepp-Herberger foundation, which promotes football in schools, clubs, and prisons; and the Justin Rockola Association, whose goal is the protection of young people against violence, alcohol and drugs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p><p>He received his coaching license in 2010. After having studied business at the PrivatuniversitÃ¤t Schloss Seeburg Kahn obtained a Master of Business Administration degree in 2012. His thesis topic was "Strategic management in Germany's professional soccer".

<p>Regarded as one of the greatest and most successful goalkeepers of all-time, in addition to his goalkeeping technique, agility, reflexes, distribution, command of his area, and shot-stopping abilities, Kahn is widely admired for the stamina, mental strength, and composure he showed to overcome the stresses and pressures of his career. His profile on the Bayern Munich website lists his attributes as "impatient, disciplined, ambitious".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>Known for his eccentricity and charismatic leadership from the back, which often saw him call out his defenders whenever they made errors, due to the formidable presence, commanding influence, and aggressive playing style that he showed in goal during his professional career, Kahn's epithet is "The Titan"; he was also frequently nicknamed "King Kahn" throughout his career.
