<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Williams was born into a Welsh-speaking, working class family at 1 Jones Terrace, Penyffordd, Ffynnongroyw, Flintshire.  He spoke only Welsh until the age of eight and was barely literate.  Later he said he would probably have begun working in the mines at age 12 if he had not caught the attention of a London social worker named Sarah Grace Cooke, the model for Miss Moffat in The Corn Is Green.  She established a school in Holywell Grammar School in 1915, and, recognising Williams's aptitude for languages, granted him a scholarship. Over the next seven years she worked with him on his English and helped him prepare to be a teacher. She obtained a scholarship for him to visit Switzerland, to study French, and when he was 17 she helped him win a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he read French and Italian.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In 1926, during his studies at Oxford, Williams had a nervous breakdown, which was blamed largely on a failed emotional friendship with another undergraduate, but Miss Cooke encouraged him to write as a way to recover.  However, Williams intended to enter the theatrical world too and joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Professional_career">Professional career</span></h2>
<p>He performed with the OUDS in his first full-length play, <i>Full Moon</i>, at the original Oxford Playhouse in 1927, and later that year he joined a London-based repertory company and began his stage career. By 1930, he had expanded his writing with works such as <i>A Murder Has Been Arranged</i> and <i>The Late Christopher Bean</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Over the next few years, Williams took on roles on stage and on film, including the first celluloid version of the Edgar Wallace mystery, <i>The Frightened Lady</i>.  He became an overnight star, however, with his thriller <i>Night Must Fall</i> (1935), in which he also played the lead role of a psychopathic murderer. The play was noted for its exploration of the killer's complex psychological state, a step forward for its genre. It was made into a film in 1937 with Robert Montgomery, and again in 1964 with Albert Finney. It has been frequently revived, most recently in the West End with Jason Donovan, and on Broadway in 1999 with Matthew Broderick.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>His other great play was very different: <i>The Corn Is Green</i> (1938), partly based on his own childhood in Wales. He starred as a Welsh schoolboy in the play's London premiere. The play came to Broadway in 1940 with Ethel Barrymore as the schoolteacher Miss Moffat.  A 1950 Broadway revival starred Eva La Gallienne. The play was turned into a film starring Bette Davis, and again into a made-for-television film starring Katharine Hepburn, under the direction of Williams's close friend George Cukor. An attempt to turn the play into a musical in the 1970s, with Davis again in the role of the schoolteacher with lyrics by Williams, failed. So did a Broadway revival in 1983 starring Cicely Tyson and Peter Gallagher. But a 1985 London revival at the Old Vic with Deborah Kerr was successful, as was a 2007 production at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. That production starred Kate Burton. Williams was a close friend of Kate's parents, Richard Burton and Burton's first wife, Sybil. In the Williamstown production, the schoolboy â€” the role created by and modeled on Williams himself â€” was played by Kate Burton's son, Morgan Ritchie.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>His autobiographical light comedy, <i>The Druid's Rest</i> was first performed at the St Martin's Theatre, London, in 1944. It saw the stage debut of Richard Burton whom Williams had spotted at an audition in Cardiff. The play has been revived at Clwyd Theatr Cymru in both 1976 and 2005, and received its first London revival in sixty years at London's Finborough Theatre in 2009.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>In addition to stage plays, Williams wrote a number of film screenplays, working with Alfred Hitchcock (on <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much</i>), Carol Reed and other directors. He acted in and contributed dialogue to various films based on the novels of A. J. Cronin, including <i>The Citadel</i> (1938), <i>The Stars Look Down</i> (1939), <i>Hatter's Castle</i> (1942) and <i>Web of Evidence</i> (1959). He played the mad Roman emperor Caligula in an uncompleted 1937 film version of Robert Graves's novel <i>I, Claudius</i> (with Charles Laughton); a kindly veterinarian who accidentally causes the death of a murderess (played by Bette Davis) in the 1952 suspense drama <i>Another Man's Poison</i>; and the fool Wamba in the 1952 <i>Ivanhoe</i> (with Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Other screen credits include Hitchcock's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's <i>Jamaica Inn</i> (with Charles Laughton), Gabriel Pascal's film version of George Bernard Shaw's <i>Major Barbara</i> (with Wendy Hiller and Rex Harrison), JosÃ© Ferrer's <i>I Accuse!</i> (playing Ã‰mile Zola), <i>The Wreck of the Mary Deare</i> (with Gary Cooper), <i>The L-Shaped Room</i> (with Leslie Caron), and a made-for-TV adaptation of Charles Dickens's <i>David Copperfield</i> (with an all-star cast including Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave, Ralph Richardson and Edith Evans). In 1941 Williams starred in the film <i>You Will Remember</i>, directed by Jack Raymond and written by Sewell Stokes and Lydia Hayward. The film is based on the life of the popular late Victorian songwriter Leslie Stuart, played here by Robert Morley, with Williams as Stuart's best friend. Also in 1941, he had a principal supporting part (as Snobby Price) in Gabriel Pascal's filming of George Bernard Shaw's <i>Major Barbara</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>His only film as a director, <i>The Last Days of Dolwyn</i> (1949), which he also wrote and starred in, marked the screen debut of his fellow Welshman, Richard Burton. Williams often appeared in his own plays, and was famous for his one-man-shows, with which he toured the world, playing Charles Dickens in an evening of excerpts from Dickens' novels. This "one man show" was the start of a whole new theatrical genre. He followed up his Dickens performance with one man shows based on the works of Dylan Thomas, <i>Dylan Thomas Growing Up</i>, and H.H. Munro better known under his pseudonym Saki. His post-war acting credits included <i>The Winslow Boy</i> by Terence Rattigan and <i>The Deputy</i> aka <i>The Representative</i> by Rolf Hochhuth on Broadway. He also was the "voice" of Lloyd George in the seminal BBC documentary <i>The Great War</i> (1964).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Among Williams' other books was the best seller <i>Beyond Belief: A Chronicle of Murder and its Detection</i> (1968), a semi-fictionalised account of the Moors murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. His 1980 novel <i>Headlong</i>, the fictional story of the unexpected death of the entire British royal family in a freak accident in 1930, and the ascension of a most unlikely heir to the British throne as a result, was the loose basis of the 1991 motion picture <i>King Ralph</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>On Monday 17 February 1975 Williams was Roy Plomley's guest on Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4.  The author's book choice was a dictionary with a typewriter, pen and paper combined as his luxury.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Williams was married in 1935 to actress Mary Marjorie O'Shann (Molly Shan), who died in 1970. They had two sons, Alan, a writer, and Brook, an actor. Brook Williams became a close friend of Richard Burton's, working as Burton's personal assistant and appearing in many of Burton's films.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>Both during his marriage and following his wife's death, Williams was actively bisexual throughout his adult life. He maintained a relationship from 1981 to 1986 with American theatre journalist Albert N. Williams (no relation), whom Emlyn Williams met while appearing at the Northlight Theatre in the Chicago area with his one-man Charles Dickens show. (Albert Williams served as Emlyn Williams' personal assistant during a 1982 tour of England, Wales and Ireland with the Charles Dickens and Dylan Thomas solo shows.)
