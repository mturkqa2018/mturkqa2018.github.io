<p><i><b>Ghajini</b></i> is a 2008 Indian Hindi-language action-thriller film written and directed by A. R. Murugadoss, with a climax co-written by Aamir Khan, and produced by Allu Aravind, Tagore Madhu and Madhu Mantena. It stars Aamir Khan, Asin, Jiah Khan and Pradeep Rawat in lead roles, with Tinnu Anand, and Riyaz Khan in supporting roles. The score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>It is a Bollywood remake of Murugadoss's own 2005 Tamil film of the same name, which in turn was inspired by the film <i>Memento</i> (2000). <i>Ghajini</i> follows the story of a businessman who develops anterograde amnesia following a violent encounter in which his love interest, a model named Kalpana, was killed. He tries to avenge the killing with the aid of photographs from a Polaroid Instant camera and permanent tattoos on his body. It largely follows the same plot as the Tamil original, but with an altered climax rewritten by Aamir Khan.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p><i>Ghajini</i> became the highest-grossing Indian film of 2008, and the first Indian film to cross the <span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>100 crore mark domestically, creating the 100 Crore Club. <i>Ghajini'</i>s paid preview collections were <span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>27<span class="nowrap"> </span>million. On release, it became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, until it was surpassed by another Aamir Khan movie, <i>3 Idiots</i> (2009), the following year. Aamir Khan's character was featured in a 3D video game titled <i>Ghajini – The Game</i>, which is based on the film.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Sunita (Jiah Khan) is a medical student working on a project about the human brain with her classmates. When she was denied access by her professor to the curious case of Sanjay Singhania (Aamir Khan), a man reported to have anterograde amnesia, because it is under criminal investigation, Sunita decides to investigate the matter herself.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>It is later revealed that Sanjay loses his memory every 15 minutes. He uses a system of photographs, notes, and tattoos on his body to recover his memory after each cycle to remind himself of his mission: to avenge the death of his girlfriend Kalpana (Asin). He systematically kills the people who were involved in the murder. His main target is Ghajini Dharmatma (Pradeep Rawat), a notable social personality in the city, and the man directly responsible for Kalpana's death and Sanjay's condition.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Police inspector Arjun Yadav (Riyaz Khan) tracks Sanjay down to his apartment and knocks him unconscious. Yadav finds two diaries in which Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2005 and 2006. The film flashes back to 2005 as Yadav reads the diary. Sanjay Singhania is the chairman of the Air Voice mobile telephone company. In the course of business, he sends his men to meet Kalpana, a struggling model of Mumbai, about putting up a billboard above her apartment. The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm misinterprets this as a romantic advance and, in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign, encourages Kalpana to accept the overture. Kalpana thinks of it as an innocent prank that may fetch her better modelling work and decides to act as Sanjay's girlfriend. Sanjay goes to confront Kalpana about this but falls in love with her at first sight. He hides his identity and introduces himself as Sachin, and the two begin spending time together. The diary ends with Sanjay proposing to Kalpana and promising himself that he will reveal his actual identity if she accepts.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>When Yadav is about to read the 2006 diary, Sanjay awakes and attacks him, tying him up. Ghajini realizes that someone is trying to kill him but is unable to figure out who. Sunita visits Sanjay's flat and discovers Sanjay's plan to kill Ghajini. She takes both his diaries before finding Yadav, beaten and bound, and freeing him. Just then, Sanjay arrives, he remembers neither of them and chases them out. Yadav is hit by a bus as he flees in terror, and Sunita, believing Ghajini is the good guy in danger, informs him about Sanjay. Ghajini arrives at Sanjay's flat and destroys all of Sanjay's photographs and notes, as well as the tattoos on Sanjay's body, so that Sanjay is left with nothing to help him recover his memory.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Sanjay discovers that Sunita had warned Ghajini and he goes to her dormitory to kill her, but Sunita calls the police and Sanjay is arrested. Back in her dormitory as Sunita reads the diaries, the film flashes back to 2006, where it is revealed that Kalpana had accepted Sanjay's proposal. When this diary ends abruptly, Sunita investigates further and discovers that Kalpana was travelling to Goa for a modelling assignment when she came upon 25 innocent young girls being trafficked. She had saved the girls with the help of some army soldiers on board, who named Ghajini as the ringleader of the racket. Outraged, Ghajini broke into Kalpana's apartment with his goons to kill her. When Sanjay arrived, he found Kalpana stabbed. Ghajini then hit Sanjay over the head with an iron rod. Sanjay's last sight was Ghajini brutally murdering Kalpana with the iron rod. Kalpana's last word to Sanjay was "Ghajini."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Sunita, now aware of the shocking truth, finds Sanjay in the hospital and tells him the truth. He flies into a heartbroken rage and tracks down Ghajini with Sunita's help. He fights off all of Ghajini's henchmen with a superior and anger-fueled strength. Ghajini, upon realizing Sanjay is too strong for him, flees. Sanjay's memory loss strikes again, and he forgets who Ghajini is. Ghajini takes this opportunity to stab Sanjay and taunt him with the grisly tale of how he murdered Kalpana. As he is about to make Sanjay relive the experience by killing Sunita in the same exact way, Sanjay recovers the memory of Kalpana's murder, and overpowers Ghajini in a flash of strength. He finally kills Ghajini, in the same way Ghajini had killed Kalpana.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The film ends 6 months later, with a still-amnesiac Sanjay who is once again the Chairman of AirVoice and is volunteering at an orphanage named after Kalpana. Sunita gives him a gift that reminds him of his bond, with Kalpana, and Sanjay sees Kalpana by his side. Sanjay is finally at peace with himself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>It was rumoured earlier that the film was titled <i>Kajri</i>. It is a remake of the Tamil film, <i>Ghajini</i> (2005). Aamir Khan, who had never before made a remake film in his career, was initially hesitant to do the film, but was convinced by Suriya, the original star of the Tamil <i>Ghajini</i>, who told him he was "the only one who could do justice to the character." Suriya was a fan of Khan, and had some involvement in the film's development, discussing minute details with Khan for two years during the film's development. Priyanka Chopra was offered the lead female role in the film. However she turned down the part because of scheduling conflict.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Aamir Khan was involved in the film's creative writing process, deciding what should remain from the original Tamil <i>Ghajini</i> and what changes should be made. Murgadass revealed that the altered climax of the film was rewritten by Khan. According to A.R. Murugadoss:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r886047036">.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}</style><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>We didn't make too many changes in the rest of the film. Every time I'd suggest a change in <i>Ghajini</i> from the original, Aamir would firmly cut it down, saying we should stick to the Tamil script. But he decided we should rewrite the climax. The entire location, incidents and dialogues for the climax were re-written by Aamir. I think the Hindi version is far better than the Tamil <i>Ghajini</i> because of the changes Aamir made.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Influences">Influences</span></h3>
<p>Murdagoss's original 2005 Tamil version of <i>Ghajini</i> was inspired by the American film <i>Memento</i> (2000), which itself was adapted from the short story <i>Memento Mori</i>. The film stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a former insurance fraud investigator searching for the man he believes raped and killed his wife during a burglary. Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, which he contracted from severe head trauma during the attack on his wife. Certain concepts like writing notes behind instant Polaroid photographs and tattooing facts on his body are also similar. According to Aamir Khan, "<i>Ghajini</i> is not a remake or even slightly inspired by <i>Memento</i>, but it's a remake of the Tamil film, <i>Ghajini</i>". However, he acknowledged that Murgadoss's original Tamil film was at least partly inspired by <i>Memento</i>, stating, "Murgadoss had heard about a film called <i>Memento</i> and the concept had really fascinated him. Without having seen the film he went ahead and wrote his own version of the script and screenplay. Having finished his script, he then saw <i>Memento</i>, found it very different from what he had written, and went ahead and made <i>Ghajini</i>." Christopher Nolan was later made aware that an Indian film with a plot similar to <i>Memento</i> was released. As said by Anil Kapoor in an interview, when he met Nolan, he said Nolan was "upset" about the film and Nolan said that he was neither credited nor compensated.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>The film's title is a reference to Mahmud of Ghazni, the tenth-century Sultan of Ghaznavid Empire whose name is pronounced "Ghajini" in Tamil. Several comical scenes in the film are similar to <i>Happy Go Lovely</i> (1951). The scene where Kalpana (Asin Thottumkal) helps a blind man to cross the road is similar to the French film <i>Amélie</i>.. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>The CGI opening brain sequence was a direct inspiration from the opening sequence from the 1999 David Fincher film, Fight Club. The film's title sequence is a visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting from a neuron.
