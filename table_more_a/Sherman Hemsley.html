<p>Sherman Hemsley performed with local groups in Philadelphia before moving to New York to study with Lloyd Richards at the Negro Ensemble Company. Shortly after, he joined Vinnette Carroll's Urban Arts Company appearing in these productions: <i>But Never Jam Today</i>, <i>The Lottery</i>, <i>Old Judge Mose is Dead</i>, <i>Moon on a Rainbow Shawl</i>, <i>Step Lively Boys</i>, <i>Croesus</i>, and <i>The Witch</i>. He made his Broadway debut in <i>Purlie</i> and toured with the show for a year. In the summer of 1972, he joined the Vinnette Carroll musical <i>Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope</i> ensemble in Toronto, followed a month later in the American Conservatory Theater production at the Geary Theater. In this production, Hemsley performed the solos "Lookin' Over From Your Side" in Act I and "Sermon" in Act II.

<p>While Hemsley was on Broadway with <i>Purlie</i>, Norman Lear called him in 1971 to play the recurring role of George Jefferson in his new sitcom, <i>All in the Family</i>. Hemsley was reluctant to leave his theatre role, but Lear told him that he would hold the role open for him. Hemsley joined the cast two years later. The characters of Hemsley and co-star Isabel Sanford were supporting occasional roles on <i>All in the Family</i>, but were given their own spin-off, <i>The Jeffersons</i>, two years after Hemsley made his debut on the sitcom. <i>The Jeffersons</i> proved to be one of Lear's most successful series, enjoying a run of 11 seasons through 1985.

<p>Hemsley continued to work steadily after the show's cancellation, largely typecast in George Jefferson–like roles. He teamed with the sitcom's original cast members when <i>The Jeffersons</i> moved to Broadway for a brief run. He later joined the cast of NBC's <i>Amen</i> in 1986 as Deacon Ernest Frye, a church deacon. The sitcom enjoyed a run of five seasons, ending in 1991. Hemsley then was a voice actor in the ABC live-action puppet series <i>Dinosaurs</i>, where he played Bradley P. Richfield, main character Earl's boss. The series ran four seasons, ending in 1994.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Hemsley retired from television acting, although Isabel Sanford and he appeared together in the mid to late 1990s and in the early 2000s, reprising their roles in guest roles on such television series as <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>, in commercials for The Gap, Old Navy, and Denny's, and at dry cleaning conventions. He also starred with Sanford in a touring company of <i>The Real Live Jeffersons</i> stage show in the 1990s.  Sanford and he made a cameo appearance in the film <i>Sprung</i>. They continued to work together on occasion until Sanford began having health problems that led to her death in 2004. 
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In 2001, Hemsley appeared as a contestant of the "Celebrity Classic TV Edition" special of ABC's hit primetime quiz show <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i> and won $125,000 for his charity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Hemsley made four appearances in the sitcom <i>Sister, Sister</i> as Ray Campbell's father. He also made a voice appearance as himself in the Seth MacFarlane animated comedy <i>Family Guy</i>. He appeared in the film <i>American Pie Presents: The Book of Love</i>. In 2011, he reprised his role as George Jefferson for the final time, along with Marla Gibbs as Florence Johnston on <i>Tyler Perry's House of Payne</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2012.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_career">Music career</span></h2>
<p>In 1989, Hemsley, who had been a jazz keyboardist, released a single, "Ain't That a Kick in the Head". This was followed in 1992 with <i>Dance</i>, an album of rhythm and blues music. He appeared on <i>Soul Train</i> around the time of the record's release and also performed the song "Eyes in the Dark".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>Hemsley was an enthusiastic fan of 1970s progressive rock bands, including Yes, Gentle Giant, Gong, and Nektar.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life_and_death">Personal life and death</span></h2>
<p>Hemsley was a shy and intensely private man, described by some as reclusive. He avoided the Hollywood limelight and little of his personal life was public knowledge beyond the facts that he never married and he had no children. In 2003, however, Hemsley granted a rare video interview to the Archive of American Television. "It [playing George Jefferson] was hard for me. But he was the character. I had to do it."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>On July 24, 2012, Hemsley died at his home in El Paso, Texas, at age 74. The cause of death was given as superior vena cava syndrome, a complication associated with lung and bronchial carcinomas. He had had a malignant mass on one of his lungs for which chemotherapy and radiation had been recommended, according to the El Paso County Texas Medical Examiner's report.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Posthumous">Posthumous</span></h2>
<p>On August 28, 2012, an El Paso news anchor interviewed Flora Isela Enchinton, the sole beneficiary of Hemsley's will, who said they were friends and had been business partners for more than two decades. During this time she lived with Hemsley and Hemsley's friend Kenny Johnston. Enchinton told the Associated Press Hemsley never mentioned any relatives. "Some people come out of the woodwork—they think Sherman, they think money", Enchinton told AP. "But the fact is that I did not know Sherman when he was in the limelight. I met them when they [Hemsley and Johnston] came running from Los Angeles with not one penny, when there was nothing but struggle."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>A Philadelphia man named Richard Thornton claimed to be the brother of Hemsley and the true heir to his estate. After contesting the will, Thornton halted progress on funeral arrangements, and as a result, Hemsley's body remained at the San Jose Funeral Home in El Paso and unburied for months. On November 9, 2012, the legal battle over Hemsley's body ended when Judge Patricia Chew ruled in favor of Enchinton.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>A military funeral was planned for Hemsley. He was interred at Fort Bliss National Cemetery in his adopted hometown of El Paso.
