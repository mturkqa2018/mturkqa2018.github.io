<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bidding_for_the_franchise">Bidding for the franchise</span></h3>
<p>In June 2006 the Department for Transport (DfT) announced its intention to restructure some rail franchises. Included was an East Midlands franchise combining the Midland Mainline franchise with the East Midlands services of the Central Trains franchise.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In September 2006 the Department for Transport announced that Arriva, FirstGroup, National Express and Stagecoach had been shortlisted to bid for the franchise.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In June 2007 the Department for Transport awarded the East Midlands franchise to Stagecoach and services operated by Central Trains and Midland Mainline transferred to East Midlands Trains on 11 November 2007. Originally due to end in March 2015, the franchise has been extended several times and is now planned to finish in August 2019. In April 2019, the DfT announced that Abellio had won its bid for the East Midlands franchise, after Stagecoach was disqualified from the process due to not meeting pension obligations. The service will be renamed "East Midlands Railway" and the contract is due to last until August 2027.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Amidst a background of ongoing rail strikes on a national level, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) warned in September 2017 that East Midlands Trains staff could be balloted for potential industrial action following a breakdown in negotiations over an ongoing pay rise dispute. The dispute was eventually settled without industrial action, and the threat of strikes on East Midlands Trains services was dropped.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Services">Services</span></h3>
<p>East Midlands Trains initially divided its services between two sub-brands: <i>Mainline</i> inter-city services, and <i>Connect</i> urban and suburban services, which mainly came from the Central Trains franchise. However, from April 2008, the company dropped the "Mainline" and "Connect" branding in favour of "London" and "Local" services. It also has four broad routes for the areas in which it operates, except for the high-speed services, which all serve London.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>EMT promised better integration between "London" and "Local" services, together with increased punctuality and becoming more user-friendly.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>On 25 November 2008, Peter Bone (MP for Wellingborough) asked if the Secretary of State for Transport supports the "In the Can" campaign, whereby sardines are sent to the Chief Executive to show dissatisfaction at perceived overcrowding. Helen Southworth (then MP for Warrington South) also raised the overcrowding issue on the same day.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="London_services">London services</span></h4>
<p>The service pattern at the start of the franchise was of 4 off-peak departures from London: 2 fast (1 each to Sheffield and Nottingham) and 2 stopping (1 each to Derby and Nottingham). Sheffield peak-hour trains extended from and to Leeds, with weekend services also extending to York/Scarborough. 1 peak-hour Derby service was extended to Burton-on-Trent and one to Barnsley. EMT made no significant changes until the introduction of its December 2008 timetable.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In December 2008, EMT made significant changes to the service pattern, which was similar to the current one (see below). There are five off-peak departures from London: 2 fast (1 to Sheffield and 1 to Nottingham), 1 semi-fast (initially to Derby; extended to Sheffield from December 2009) and 2 stopping (1 to Nottingham and 1 to Corby). A smaller number of Sheffield peak-hour trains continue to extend from and to Leeds, with weekend services also extending to York/Scarborough. In addition a Nottingham service is extended to start from Lincoln Central on weekdays and Saturdays. There were plans initially for 2 return services to Skegness through from London in the summer; however, these currently run through from Derby instead of London, because of speed restrictions around Boston. The Burton-on-Trent and Barnsley services ceased at the beginning of the December 2008 timetable, when Corby services began. One Corby service was extended to Melton Mowbray at the outset, and a second was added to Derby from May 2010.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In December 2013, the Midland Main Line officially started running at 125Â mph (200Â km/h) in some areas, cutting journey times.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Local_services">Local services</span></h4>
<p>The Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Central, Manchester Oxford Road and Piccadilly, Sheffield, Nottingham, Peterborough and Ely to Norwich service was previously provided by Central Trains. Nottinghamshire County Council has consistently campaigned for better services between the four core cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham. Network Rail's plans for the Northern Hub would deliver extra train paths along the Hope Valley Line, enabling more trains to run from the North West to the East Midlands. In December 2012, double-unit trains were provided for services between Manchester and Nottingham to ease overcrowding.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Routes">Routes</span></h2>
<p>East Midlands Trains' services can be categorised into two types:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<ul><li><i>London</i>: inter-city services out of London St Pancras station, along the Midland Main Line, to various towns and cities in the East Midlands region including Bedford, Corby, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. Some peak-time services also serve Lincoln Central, Doncaster, Leeds and York, while a single Saturday service also runs to and from Scarborough in the summer. These services all use Class 222 trains or HST sets, which are painted in a white livery.</li>
<li><i>Local</i>: short- and medium-distance services mostly within the East Midlands region, plus the long-distance route between Liverpool Lime Street and Norwich. These services are operated by Sprinters (Class 153s, Class 156s and Class 158s). The Class 158 units are painted in a white livery, while the remaining units are all in a blue livery.</li></ul>
<p>As of January 2018, the typical off-peak weekday East Midlands Trains services, with frequencies in trains per hour (tph), include:

<p>East Midlands Parkway is used as an interchange station for combined multi-modal journeys under the brand name "MegabusPlus", whereby passengers are carried by road coach from the cities in the north of England to East Midlands Parkway, where passengers transfer to rail for the service to London.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Routes operated under the "MegabusPlus" brand are between London and:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p>
<ul><li>Hull via Scunthorpe</li>
<li>York via Castleford and Harrogate</li>
<li>Huddersfield via Bradford and Halifax</li></ul>
<p>The bus from Hull and Scunthorpe also had a stop at Doncaster at the launch of MegabusPlus, but due to lack of demand in Doncaster, the service no longer calls there.

<p>Originally it was proposed to remove the buffet cars from High Speed Train sets as they are very heavy and used only to cook breakfast on some trains; they were to be replaced by an at-seat trolley service. The company reviewed its decision and launched an enhanced catering service for the start of the May 2008 timetable. Since September 2010 Rail Gourmet has provided all standard class catering. WiFi has been available on all services from London since 5 September 2010.

<p>Stagecoach have targeted 90.3% (PPM) on London services and 87% (PPM) on Local services. Previously the Central Trains franchise had had difficulties with timekeeping due to the high number of potential clashes with late running other services en route and use of insufficient stock, causing long dwell times at stations due to slow unloading and loading. Figures released rated Central Trains' performance at 87.8% for the PPM (Public Performance Measure) over the first quarter of the financial year 2007/8. Latest figures released by NR (Network Rail) rated performance over the last year (up to 12 October 2013) at 91.5% (MAA) and 92.0% (PPM) for the seventh period of the financial year 2013/14.

<p>Other than the lines to Liverpool and Manchester, no East Midlands Trains routes are electrified north of Bedford and all trains are diesel-powered.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>East Midlands Trains inherited Midland Mainlineâ€™s InterCity 125 (HST) and Class 222 <i>Meridian</i> diesel-electric high-speed trains, along with some of the Sprinter diesel units (classes 153/156/158) formerly operated by Central Trains.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>All Class 158 units have been refurbished in a style similar to sister company South West Trains' fleet, although with a higher seating capacity.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>East Midlands Trains announced in March 2008 that it was to reform its Class 222 sets to prevent overcrowding. This saw the remaining 4-car Class 222 units receive an extra vehicle to become 5-car sets. This was accomplished by reducing one of the 8-car sets to a 5-car, with the remaining 8-car sets reduced to 7-cars. Extra capacity on long-distance routes is provided by running pairs of 5-car sets coupled together.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>Hull Trains made a decision to use only Class 180 <i>Adelante</i> units, with its Class 222 <i>Meridian</i> units transferring to East Midlands Trains.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>East Midlands Trains began the service from Corby on 23 February 2009. Initially, this was made up of one train per day in each direction, using the existing <i>Meridian</i> fleet. The full Corby service started on 27 April 2009.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>The Sprinter fleet that EMT inherited at the start of the franchise was in a very poor state. Problems ranged from basic and simple to major complicated faults. The fleet was put together from various sources â€“ around four different previous companies, with some coming directly from passenger work but some that had been lying idle surplus to requirements off lease in sidings. East Midlands Trains has claimed that it will take the lifetime of the franchise to get the trains to a standard that it is happy with. In addition to the various sources of the trains, passenger figures given to the Department for Transport prior to the franchise were incorrect, leading to a shortfall in the number of seats provided (a 26% decrease in capacity on route 2) compared with what was required.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>Four additional Class 156 DMUs, leased from Angel Trains have been cascaded from Northern to enable more route 2 services to run as four-coach trains by using these cascaded Class 156s on Skegness services instead of Class 158s. From December 2012 when the Sprinter refurbishment programme is complete, all route 2 services between Liverpool and Nottingham will be able to operate as four-coach trains. In addition, from December 2011 the 13:52 from Liverpool will operate through to Norwich.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>In early 2018, East Midlands Trains obtained an additional three 6-car InterCity 125 sets from Grand Central, which were used to improve capacity on the Midland Main Line by replacing Class 222 units on some services. The first of these powercars entered service in February 2018, with powercar 43467 being named "Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service"/"British Transport Police Nottingham" in commemoration of the services' work during the fire at Nottingham station earlier in the year.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>In Mid 2018 East Midlands Trains received 4 ex Great Western Railway Class 153s and later in 2019 more of these trains will transfer to East Midlands Trains when an additional 8 class 153s will transfer from West Midlands Trains to EMT.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Future_of_the_franchise">Future of the franchise</span></h2>
<p>The franchise is due to end in August 2019. In March 2017, the DfT announced Stagecoach, Arriva UK Trains and a joint venture between FirstGroup and Trenitalia had been shortlisted to bid for the next franchise. Abellio was added in February 2018. An Invitation to Tender was issued in June 2018, detailing the improvements that bidders for the franchise must make. The contract will then be awarded in April 2019. FirstGroup and Trenitalia pulled out of the bidding process in April 2018 to focus on the West Coast Partnership franchise. The franchise was awarded to Abellio East Midlands, which will be branded as East Midlands Railway. The next franchise will run from 18 August 2019 until 22 August 2027.
