<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Lesko was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin and grew up nearby, the daughter of Don and Delores Lorenz. She received a bachelor’s degree in business from the University of Wisconsin and in the 1980s moved to Arizona, owning a construction sales business. She left an abusive marriage in the 1990s and later married Joe Lesko.

<p>Debbie Lesko was the Republican nominee for the special election held to replace Congressman Trent Franks, who resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. She faced the Democratic candidate, physician Hiral Tipirneni, in the general election on April 24. She was endorsed by President Donald Trump who said that Lesko was a "conservative Republican". It was the closest contest in what is now the 8th since 1976, when Bob Stump won what was then the 3rd District with just 47 percent of the vote (the district was renumbered as the 2nd in 2003, and has been the 8th since 2013).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>She won the election on April 24, beating Democratic candidate Hiral Tipirneni with 52.6% of the vote to Tipirneni's 47.4. The win was by a narrower margin than expected, with observers suggesting that it was indicative of a coming Democratic wave in the 2018 mid-term elections. Indeed, it was the closest race in the district since Bob Stump, then a Democrat, won his first term in what was then the 3rd District with only 47.5 percent of the vote (the district was renumbered as the 2nd in 2003 and has been the 8th since 2013).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>According to the Associated Press, the election sent "a big message to Republicans nationwide: Even the reddest of districts in a red state can be in play this year."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2018_general_election">2018 general election</span></h3>
<p>Lesko faced a rematch with Tipirneni in a bid for a full two-year term and won with a slightly wider margin, taking 55.5% to Tipirneni's 44.5 percent.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Campaign_finance_complaints">Campaign finance complaints</span></h4>
<p>In January 2018, Lesko's campaign committee, Re-elect Debbie Lesko for Senate, gave $50,000 to Conservative Leadership for Arizona, a federal PAC authorized to spend independently of other campaigns. It was created eight days before taking the money from Lesko's state campaign committee. The new PAC raised almost no other cash, records show, and the PAC used the money to support Lesko with yard signs, while her congressional campaign spent heavily on TV ads. Phil Lovas, a candidate in the Republican primary, complained to the Federal Election Commission and Arizona Attorney General alleging multiple violations in February 2018.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>The PAC maneuver also prompted criticism from the other Lesko opponent in the Republican primary, Steve Montenegro, who accused Lesko of "illegally funneling money into her SuperPAC and knowingly lied about it by filing false campaign reports." A second complaint alleging federal campaign finance law violations was filed against Lesko in March 2018 by the Campaign Legal Center alleging that her transfer of $50,000 from her state campaign to an independent group that spent nearly all the cash backing her congressional run was illegal.

<p>Lesko has said that she would have voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Republican Party's 2017 tax overhaul. She favors a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and said that "on the federal level, there has to be a lot of areas where we can cut spending."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In 2017, Lesko championed legislation that would allow payday lenders to provide loans at interest rates as high as 164% a year (the previous maximum was 36%).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>In 2016, she opposed efforts to increase the minimum wage in Arizona to $10 by 2017 and then to $12 by 2020.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
<p>Lesko favors empowering private schools and charter schools.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment_and_energy">Environment and energy</span></h3>
<p>Asked at a debate involving seven candidates in January 2018 whether she believed that humans contribute to climate change, Lesko did not raise her hand. After a long pause, she said that the question was "loaded" and added, "Is some of it, maybe, human-caused? Possibly. But certainly not the majority of it. I think it just goes through cycles and it has to do a lot with the sun. So no, I'm not a global warming proponent."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In 2016, Lesko crafted a measure that would give state utilities in Arizona the right to charge separate rates for customers who produced their own energy through solar panels. Lesko crafted the measure with the assistance of utilities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Health_care">Health care</span></h3>
<p>Lesko has said she opposes "universal health coverage" and favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). She opposed Arizona's expansion of Medicaid coverage and sued former Arizona governor Jan Brewer after she expanded Medicaid.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Immigration">Immigration</span></h3>
<p>During her 2018 campaign, Lesko made the construction of a border wall on the Mexico border the centerpiece of her campaign, and she pledged to back the Trump administration's hardline positions on border security and immigration reform.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_issues">Social issues</span></h3>
<p>Lesko is pro-life. She has proposed legislation to give employers religious exemptions from providing contraceptives in health insurance plans. She has proposed legislation that would allow health officials to conduct warrantless and unannounced inspections of abortion clinics, like they do for all other health institutions in the state, which critics said undermined the privacy of patients at the clinics.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>She opposes changes to existing gun laws, saying "I think there's enough laws. The laws need to be enforced."
