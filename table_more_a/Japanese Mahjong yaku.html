It is essential to know the <i>yaku</i> for game strategy, since a player must have a minimum of one <i>yaku</i> in their hand in order to legally win a hand. Each <i>yaku</i> has a specific <i>han</i> value. <i>Yaku</i> conditions may be combined to produce hands of greater value. The game also features <i>dora</i>, that allow a hand to add <i>han</i> value, but that cannot count as <i>yaku</i>. Altogether, a hand's points value increases exponentially with every <i>han</i> a hand contains.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p><i>Yaku</i> are somewhat similar to poker hands.  They fit certain patterns based on the numbers or types of tiles included, as well as the relative value of the tiles.  Unlike poker, however, multiple hand types may be combined to produce hands of greater value.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>There are three basic classes of yaku:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
<ul><li>Closed hand only (<i>menzen-nomi</i>, éåã®ã¿)</li>
<li>"Eat and decrease" (a literal translation of <i>kuisagari</i>, å°ãä¸ãã), where the <i>han</i> value decreases by one if the hand is open</li>
<li>Yaku where the <i>han</i> value is the same regardless of whether the hand is closed or open.</li></ul>
<p>Calling for another player's discard to make a meld makes the meld and the hand open. When a winning tile of a closed hand is a discard, the meld including that discard is considered open, while the hand is still regarded as closed. If a hand is closed, the situation is called "<i>menzenchin</i> (éåæ¸)" or "<i>menzen</i> (éå)" in Japanese.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The basic concept of a <i>yaku</i> is that it fits into one of three basic criteria:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p>
<ul><li>It contains a pattern of some kind</li>
<li>It has a great deal of consistency</li>
<li>It is circumstantial based on specific game situations</li></ul>
<p>Finally, when it comes to points scoring, the total number of <i>han</i> in the hand is counted. When the <i>han</i> value is four or less, <i>fu</i> is also counted. The combination of the <i>han</i> value and <i>fu</i> value corresponds to a points table.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="List_of_yaku">List of yaku</span></h2>
<p>The following is a list of all the <i>yaku</i>, their names in English and Japanese, their <i>han</i> values, and any special conditions related to them.  They are listed here in groups according to the underlying patterns that define the <i>yaku</i>. Example hands are given, but they are often not the only possible hands with that <i>yaku</i>. All <i>yaku</i> can be divided into seven basic categories, depending on the dominant feature.  The features are as follows: patterns based on sequences, patterns based on triplets and/or quads, consistency of the type and numbers of the tiles, lucky circumstances, and special criteria.

<td colspan="4">This <i>yaku</i> is often called <i>reach</i> because its Japanese name is phonetically similar to the English word.  When a player's hand needs only one tile to win (<i>tenpai</i>) and the player has not claimed another players' discards to make open melds, then the player has the option to declare <i>riichi</i>.  Otherwise, the player may continue to play with a ready hand without making a declaration.
<dl><dt>Conditions after declaration</dt></dl>
<p>To make a declaration, the player calls out â<i>riichi</i>â, discards their tile sideways, and places a 1,000-point stick on the table as a deposit. From this point onward, the player must discard any drawn tile that does not allow them to win. Also, they may not change the content of their hand under any circumstances, with the exception of declaring certain closed quads.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In some rules, a player can declare ready only when there are four or more tiles remaining in the wall, which means the player needs to be able to draw another tile. The player owes no penalty if other players make open melds or closed quads after the declaration that prevents the player from drawing another tile.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>When all four players successfully declare ready, a hand ends as an abortive draw. Players show their hands to confirm they are <i>tenpai</i> or suffer a <i>chombo</i> penalty.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<dl><dt>Underneath dora</dt></dl>
<p>When players declare ready and win, they can have access to <i>underneath dora</i> indicator tiles. This may include tiles underneath the <i>dora</i> indicators revealed by <i>kan</i> calls.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<dl><dt>Riichi deposits</dt></dl>
<p>The winner of the hand receives any 1,000-point <i>riichi</i> sticks. In the case of multiple winners, the player closest to the discarding player (moving forward) receives all <i>riichi</i> deposits.
When draws occur after ready hand declarations, any <i>riichi</i> deposits carry-over and are placed near the counters, with the next winner receiving those <i>riichi</i> deposits. In most cases, if a draw occur after a ready hand declaration, resulting in ending the game (such as exhaustive draws in the final round with the last dealer not ready to win or exhaustive draws causing one or more players to reach a negative score), the game ends with the <i>riichi</i> deposits unclaimed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<dl><dt>Claiming a riichi discard</dt></dl>
<p>If another player claims a <i>riichi</i> discard to make open melds, the player who declared ready discards the next tile sideways. If a <i>riichi</i> discard is called to win at the time, the declaration is considered incomplete and therefore the <i>riichi</i> deposit is not forfeited.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<dl><dt>Declaring closed quads</dt></dl>
<p>A closed quad can be declared after a declaration of ready when the fourth tile of a triplet is drawn.  However, the quad must not otherwise change the composition of the hand or its waits. For example, when a player has <span class="nowrap"><img alt="MJt7.png" data-file-height="53" data-file-width="44" decoding="async" height="24" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/MJt7.png/20px-MJt7.png" srcset width="20"/><img alt="MJt7.png" data-file-height="53" data-file-width="44" decoding="async" height="24" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/MJt7.png/20px-MJt7.png" srcset width="20"/><img alt="MJt7.png" data-file-height="53" data-file-width="44" decoding="async" height="24" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/MJt7.png/20px-MJt7.png" srcset width="20"/><img alt="MJd1.png" data-file-height="53" data-file-width="44" decoding="async" height="24" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/MJd1.png/20px-MJd1.png" srcset width="20"/><img alt="MJd1.png" data-file-height="53" data-file-width="44" decoding="async" height="24" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/MJd1.png/20px-MJd1.png" srcset width="20"/></span>, they can declare a closed quad when drawing the fourth <img alt="MJt7.png" data-file-height="53" data-file-width="44" decoding="async" height="24" src="https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/MJt7.png/20px-MJt7.png" srcset width="20"/>.

<td colspan="4">A hand composed of seven pairs is considered a valid hand in Japanese mahjong. The hand is one of the two exceptions to the rule requiring winning hands to have four melds and a pair, the other being <i>thirteen orphans</i>.  The hand also has its own special rules for scoring, in which the hand has a fixed <i>fu</i> value of 25. The format of this <i>yaku</i> does not count <i>iipeikou</i> when three pairs are in sequence. The hand of <i>ryanpeikou</i> does not count as including seven pairs.
<p>In general Japanese rules, all seven pairs must be unique, that is, the same four tiles may not be split into two pairs. Some rules accept the four same tiles, for instance in the Kansai region.

<td colspan="4">This <i>yaku</i> is applied to discards, as opposed to the hand value itself.  A player's discards are all terminals and honors. A hand must be a draw (abortive draws  not applied). The hand is often recognized only if no other player called any discard from the player's discard pile. The player can make open melds depending on the rules. In most cases the value is considered a mangan. As for the payment, the hand is regarded as winning by self-draw. The rule of <i>nÅ-ten bappu</i> is usually not applied to this case as it is no longer regarded as a draw.  In addition, this hand cannot be combined with the other <i>yaku</i>.

<td colspan="4">This is a very common yaku, since it is rather easy to get.  A no-points hand is just thatâa hand that is worth no additional <i>fu</i>-points whatsoever.  Specifically, the hand must have no triplets or quads, and must not contain any pair of dragons, playerâs own wind, or wind of the round which is worth points, meaning the pair can be other winds.
<p>Furthermore, the hand must be waiting for multiple winning tiles that can make a sequence, such as having number 2 and 3 and waiting for 1 or 4; if the hand is in a closed, edge, or pair wait, it is worth two points, thus violating the no-points condition.

<p>There is a special set of hands so difficult to attain that they are worth the limit of points just for having them.  The limit value, along with the hands themselves, are called <i>yakuman</i> (å½¹æº, or <i>yaku-mangan</i> å½¹æºè²«).  Counts of <i>han</i> no longer apply to them. Some <i>yakuman</i> hands can themselves be combined to form multiple <i>yakuman</i>. Some conditions on the limit hands can render themselves double the value.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>On the other hand, the <i>han</i>-limit is established at 13, which is counted as a <i>yakuman</i> value. Some <i>yaku</i> can be combined for it, using <i>dora</i> tiles if a hand has them. The value is called <i>kazoe-yakuman</i> (æ°ãå½¹æº), or counted <i>yakuman</i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>The <i>thirteen orphans</i>, <i>four closed triplets</i> and <i>big three dragons</i> are considered relatively easy to complete among <i>yakuman</i> hands and are collectively called "the three big families of <i>yakuman</i>" (Japanese: å½¹æºå¾¡ä¸å®¶).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Some of <i>yakuman</i> hands may have respective names in some regions.  The names used here mostly come from American publications, which are based on Chinese translations.

<td colspan="4">The Japanese name of the <i>yaku</i>, <i>kokushi musou</i>, means "a peerless distinguished person in a country." Along with seven pairs, this is the only hand that contradicts the requirement for a hand to have four melds and a pair.  In a thirteen orphans hand, the player has one of each dragon tile, one of each wind tile, a 1 and a 9 (terminal) from each suit, plus any tile that matches anything else in the hand.  If a player wins in a 13-way wait for the pair, the hand is worth two <i>yakuman</i>, which is called <i>daburu</i> (double) <i>yakuman</i>.
<p>Other names for this yaku are <i>shiisan yaochuu</i> (åä¸ä¹ä¹) which means "thirteen of smallest numbers and 9's [and honors]," or its abbreviation <i>shiisan yao</i> (åä¸ä¹).

The other bamboo tiles of 1, 5, 7, and 9 have red paint on them, thereby not making them all green. Although the hand can include green dragons, it does not have to.

<td colspan="4">A player wins eight times consecutively. The conditions of the hand depend on rules. The ninth and following winnings are often yakuman again, while some rules say the sixteenth is the next yakuman. It has nothing to do with the number of <i>counters</i> because the number increases when a hand is a draw. In some rules, no other yaku is necessary in the eighth winning. Some say the player must be a dealer from the first time. The player is always a dealer when the hand is accomplished. The hand is often optional.
