<p>Having returned to the church at some stage during the 1970s, Shorter thought hew could use some rock and soul songs and transform them into gospel music, but he realized there couldn't be any compromise with worldly music. Having turned his back on the popular music industry, Shorter who had been acquainted artists such as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix etc., reflected on the scene he had left behind. He warned young people that there was absolutely nothing to that kind of life. Olga Soler was a woman who would end up working for Shorter in his restaurant. She was a former <i>Hair</i> cast member. She was auditioning for a part in an off-Broadway rock musical. Knowing that it wasn't a God friendly scene, Shorter was praying for her that she would leave it behind. Having heard nothing for a few weeks, she went to Tennessee with the intention of coming back in time to do some work for advertising company Batten Barton Durstine and Osborne. The day after she left, someone from the off Broadway musical contacted the restaurant to say that she had landed the lead role. Shorter never passed the info on to her, and later as a Christian she recounted this and said that she was glad he didn't, as she didn't know how things would have turned out.
