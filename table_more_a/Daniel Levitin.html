<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography_and_education">Biography and education</span></h2>
<p>Born in San Francisco, the son of Lloyd Levitin, a businessman and professor, and Sonia Levitin, a novelist. Levitin was raised in Daly City, Moraga, and Palos Verdes, California. He graduated after his junior year at Palos Verdes High School and attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he studied applied mathematics; he enrolled at the Berklee College of Music before dropping out of college to join a succession of bands, work as a record producer, and help found a record label, 415 Records.  He returned to school in his thirties, studying cognitive psychology/cognitive science first at Stanford University where he received a BA degree in 1992 (with honors and highest university distinction) and then to the University of Oregon where he received an MSc degree in 1993 and a PhD degree in 1996. He completed post-doctoral fellowships at Paul Allen's Silicon Valley think-tank Interval Research, at the Stanford University Medical School, and at the University of California, Berkeley. His scientific mentors included Roger Shepard, Michael Posner, Douglas Hintzman, John R. Pierce, and Stephen Palmer.  He has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, and Oregon Health Sciences University.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>As a cognitive neuroscientist specializing in music perception and cognition, he is credited for fundamentally changing the way that scientists think about auditory memory, showing through the Levitin Effect, that long-term memory preserves many of the details of musical experience that previous theorists regarded as lost during the encoding process. He is also known for drawing attention to the role of cerebellum in music listening, including tracking the beat and distinguishing familiar from unfamiliar music.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Outside of his academic pursuits, Levitin has worked on and off as a stand-up comedian and joke writer, performing at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco with Robin Williams in 1984, and at comedy clubs in California; he placed second in the National Lampoon stand-up comedy competition regionals in San Francisco in 1989, and has contributed jokes to Jay Leno, Arsenio Hall, as well as the nationally syndicated comic strip Bizarro, some of which were included in the 2006 compilation <i>Bizarro and Other Strange Manifestations of the Art of Dan Piraro</i> (Andrews McMeel).

<p>Levitin began playing piano at age 4, and took up clarinet at age 8, and bass clarinet and saxophone at age 12. From ages 12 – 14 he wrote arrangements for and conducted the school pep band, jazz band, and concert band at Joaquin Moraga Junior High School, in Moraga, CA, performing at civic functions and on the local CBS television affiliate, KPIX Channel 5. He continued playing saxophone (tenor and baritone) in high school, and at age 17 performed on baritone with the big band backing up Mel Tormé at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Levitin took up guitar at age 16, and has been a member of a number of bands, including The Alsea River Band (lead guitar), The Mortals (bass), Judy Garland (bass), The Shingles (lead guitar), Slings &amp; Arrows (bass), JD Buhl (bass and guitar) —and also played on recording sessions for Blue Öyster Cult, the soundtrack to <i>Repo Man,</i> and True West. He continues to perform regularly and has appeared on saxophone with Sting, Ben Sidran, and Bobby McFerrin, on guitar with Rosanne Cash, Blue Öyster Cult, Rodney Crowell, Michael Brook, Gary Lucas, Victor Wooten, Steve Bailey, Peter Case, Peter Himmelman, Lenny Kaye, Jessie Farrell, and David Byrne; and on vocals with Renée Fleming, Neil Young and Rosanne Cash. In Fall 2017 he toured the West Coast with singer-songwriter Tom Brosseau. He began writing songs at age 17 and his songwriting has been praised by a number of top songwriters including Diane Warren, and Joni Mitchell who said of them "Dan is really good at what he does, and creates rich images with his words and music."

<p>In the late 1970s, Levitin consulted for M&amp;K Sound as an expert listener assisting in the design of the first commercial satellite and subwoofer loudspeaker systems, an early version of which were used by Steely Dan for mixing their album <i>Pretzel Logic</i> (1974).  Following that, he worked at A Broun Sound in San Rafael, California, building speaker cabinets for The Grateful Dead, for whom he later worked as a consulting record producer.  Levitin was one of the golden ears used in the first Dolby AC audio compression tests, a precursor to MP3 audio compression. From 1984–1988, he worked as Director and then Vice President of A&amp;R for 415 Records in San Francisco, becoming President of the label in 1989 before the label was sold to Sony Music.  Notable achievements during that time included producing the punk classic <i>Here Come the Cops</i> by The Afflicted (named among the Top 10 records of 1985 by <i>GQ</i> magazine); engineering records by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, Santana, and the Grateful Dead; and producing tracks for Blue Öyster Cult, the soundtrack to <i>Repo Man</i> (1984), and others. Two highlights of his tenure in A&amp;R were discovering the band The Big Race (which later became the well-known soundtrack band Pray for Rain); and for having had the chance to, but <i>not</i> signing M.C. Hammer.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>After 415 was sold, he formed his own production and business consulting company, with a list of clients including AT&amp;T, several venture capital firms, and every major record label.  As a consultant for Warner Bros. Records he planned the marketing campaigns for such albums as Eric Clapton's <i>Unplugged</i> (1992) and k.d. lang's <i>Ingénue</i> (1992).  He was a music consultant on feature films such as <i>Good Will Hunting</i> (1997) and <i>The Crow: City of Angels</i> (1996), and served as a compilation consultant to Stevie Wonder's <i>Song Review: A Greatest Hits Collection</i> (1996), and to <i>As Time Goes By</i> (2003) and <i>Interpretations: A 25th Anniversary Celebration</i> (1995; updated and released as a DVD in 2003) by The Carpenters.  Levitin returned to the studio in 2002, producing three albums for Quebec blues musician Dale Boyle: <i>String Slinger Blues</i> (2002),  <i>A Dog Day for the Purists</i> (2004), and <i>In My Rearview Mirror: A Story From A Small Gaspé Town</i> (2005), the latter two of which won the annual Lys Blues Award for best Blues album.  He helped Joni Mitchell with the production of her three most recent albums, <i>Shine, Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced,</i> and <i>Starbuck's Artist's Choice: Joni Mitchell.</i>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 1998, Levitin helped to found MoodLogic.com (and its sister companies, Emotioneering.com and jaboom.com), the first Internet music recommendation company, sold in 2006 to Allmusic group.  He has also consulted for the United States Navy on underwater sound source separation, for Philips Electronics, and AT&amp;T. He served as an occasional script consultant to The Mentalist from 2007–2009.
