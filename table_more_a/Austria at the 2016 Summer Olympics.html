<p>Austria competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. It was the nation's twenty-seventh appearance at the Summer Olympics. Austrian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The Austrian Olympic Committee (German: <i lang="de">Österreichisches Olympisches Comité, ÖOC</i>) confirmed a squad of 71 athletes, 37 men and 34 women, to compete across 22 sports at the Games. The nation's full roster had one more participant than the previous two Games.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>The Austrian roster featured 29 returning Olympians, with Chinese-born table tennis player Liu Jia, who was also the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, leading them as the only competitor going to her fifth consecutive Games. Apart from Liu, judoka and Beijing 2008 silver medalist Ludwig Paischer, dressage rider Victoria Max-Theurer, and skiff duo Nico Delle-Karth and Nikolaus Resch in the 49er class also topped the roster lineup to make their fourth Olympic appearance. Other notable Austrian athletes included world-ranked sailor Lara Vadlau and her Polish-born partner Jolanta Ogar in the women's 470, London 2012 sixth-place finalist Corinna Kuhnle in slalom kayaking, and twin sisters Anna-Maria and Eirini Alexandri.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Austria left Rio de Janeiro with only a bronze medal, won by sailing duo of Thomas Zajac and Tanja Frank in the Nacra 17 class, saving its pride from returning empty-handed as they had done at London 2012. Slalom canoeist Corinna Kuhnle, rifle shooter Olivia Hofmann, discus thrower Lukas Weißhaidinger, and rower Magdalena Lobnig (sixth, women's single sculls) were among the Austrian athletes progressing to the finals of their respective sporting events, but came closest to the nation's medal haul.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>Austria participated in twenty-seven Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The nation chose table tennis player Liu Jia as its flagbearer in the opening ceremony and the sailing duo of Thomas Zajac and Tanja Frank for the closing ceremony. They were one of the three nations who used more than one person to bear the flag in the closing ceremony. A delegation of 71 athletes, 37 men and 34 women, travelled to Rio de Janeiro and competed across 22 sports. Among the sports represented by its athletes, Austria marked its Olympic debut in golf (new to the 2016 Games), as well as its return to diving after 8 years, rowing and weightlifting after 12 years, and archery after 32 years. Austrian athletes have won a total of 86 medals at the Summer Olympic Games.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Badminton at the 2016 Summer Olympics</div>
<p>Austria has qualified two badminton players for each of the following events into the Olympic tournament. Elisabeth Baldauf was selected among the top 34 individual shuttlers in the women's singles based on the BWF World Rankings as of 5 May 2016, while David Obernorsterer picked up one of the spare athlete berths from the doubles as the next highest-ranked eligible player in the men's singles. The duo, which frequently plays together in international open events, both made their individual Olympic debut. Both of them lost all their games and came last in their groups. Obernosterer competed in group E of the men's singles event together with Lin Dan, Vladimir Malkov, and Nguyễn Tiến Minh. His first game was against Lin. Lin has previously won two gold medals in the 2012 Olympics and 2008 Olympics. On 11 August, Obernosterer lost the first set 5–21 and the second 11–21. The following day, he lost 18–21 and 14–21 against Minh. Finally, on 14 August, he lost 11–21 and 10–21 to Malkov. He failed to qualify for the round of 16.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Elisabeth Baldauf was in group N of the women's singles along with Tai Tzu-ying and Natalia Perminova. She lost her first game on 11 August against Tai 11–21 in the first set and 9–21 in the second. Two days later, she lost her second and final game against Perminova 17–21 and 8–21. Tai ended up qualifying for the elimination round by beating Perminova 21-12 and 21-9 but was then eliminated by Pusarla Sindhu who later won the silver medal.

<p>For the K-1 slalom events, 21 boats qualified for the heats. The 15 best times from the two runs in the heats qualified for the semifinals, and then the best 10 boats from the semifinals qualified for the finals.

London 2012 sixth-place finalist Corinna Kuhnle (women's K-1) and rookie Mario Leitner (men's K-1) were named to the Austrian roster on June 20, 2016. Mario Leitner finished his first run in the men's kayaking event in 93.29 seconds and his second run with a worse time of  93.89 seconds.

<p>Austria has received a spare berths from the International Canoe Federation to enter two boats each in the women's K-1 200 m and the women's K-2 500 m to the Olympics, as the next highest-ranked nation, not yet qualified, at the 2015 Canoe Sprint World Championships, and as a response to the forfeiture of five boats held by the Russians due to their previous doping bans and their implications in the "disappearing positive methodology" set out in the McClaren Report on Russia's state-sponsored doping. Two-time Olympic kayakers Yvonne Schuring and Viktoria Schwarz, along with rookie Ana Roxana Lehaci, were named to the Austrian roster on July 27, 2016. Viktoria Schwarz participated in the K-1 200 metres. In the heats, she finished fifth in 42.847 seconds, qualifying for the semifinals. Rounding off her semifinal heat with a seventh-place time in 43.072, Schwarz was ineligible to compete in any of the final rounds.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>Lehaci and Schuring participated in the K-2 500 metres, finishing sixth with a time of 1:46.429 minutes and automatically qualified for the semifinals. If they would have finished first, they would have automatically qualified for the A finals. They finished fourth behind Alyssa Bull and Alyce Burnett of Australia, failing to qualify for the A final. The Austrian duos' time was 1:44.462 minutes and the Australians' was 1:44.290. In the B final, they finished third in 1:48.834 minutes, ranking eleventh overall.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Judo at the 2016 Summer Olympics</div>
<p>Austria has qualified a total of five judokas for each of the following weight classes at the Games. Daniel Allerstorfer, Kathrin Unterwurzacher, Bernadette Graf, two-time Olympian Sabrina Filzmoser, and Beijing 2008 silver medalist Ludwig Paischer were ranked among the top 22 eligible judokas for men and top 14 for women in the IJF World Ranking List of May 30, 2016. Paischer participated in the men's -60 kg event. His first game was in the round of 32 against Hovhannes Davtyan of Armenia. Following 27 seconds, Paischer lost 000–100. Meanwhile, Daniel Allerstorfer participated in the men's +100 kg. He lost in the round of 32 against Renat Saidov of Russia 000 to 010.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>In the women's events, Filzmoser participated in the women's -57 kg. She, like both male competitors, was eliminated in the first round she competed in. Nekoda Smythe-Davis of Great Britain overpowered her, finishing the match with a 000–011 scoreline. Unterwurzacher competed in the women's -63 kg event. Her first bout was in the round of 16 against two-time Olympian Estefania García of Ecuador, which she won 010–000 with a waza-ari. Her next game was against Miku Tashiro of Japan. Tashiro beat Unterwurzacher with a yuko, and so Unterwurzacher moved to the repechage match against Anicka van Emden of Netherlands. Mirroring the previous score, Unterwurzacher lost by a waza-ari 000–001. She ranked seventh overall. Graf had a similar system. She beat Maria Portela in a 000–000 contest due to a shido, but lost her next game against Laura Vargas Koch by an ippon. Unlike Unterwurzacher, Graf won the repechage bout against Kelitae Zupancic 010–001. In the bronze medal match, Graf competed against Sally Conway of Great Britain. She lost it 000 to 001. Her final ranking was 5th.
