<p>McCarthy married her longtime boyfriend, Ben Falcone, an actor and alumnus of The Groundlings, on October 8, 2005. The couple have two daughters, Vivian, born May 2007, and Georgette, born March 2010. McCarthy's pregnancy with Vivian was written into the last season of <i>Gilmore Girls</i>. Vivian played the younger version of her mother's character in the 2016 movie <i>The Boss</i>. Daughter Georgette also made an appearance in The Boss.  Both Falcone and McCarthy have expressed desire for their daughters to focus on their education and pursue professional acting afterwards.  Neither child has made appearances in movies since.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Falcone often makes cameo appearances in McCarthyâ€™s movies and TV series, such as a third-season episode of <i>Gilmore Girls</i>, <i>Bridesmaids</i>, <i>The Heat</i>, <i>Tammy</i>, <i>Identity Thief</i>, <i>Spy</i>, <i>The Boss</i> ,  â€œLife of the Partyâ€, and <i>The Happytime Murders.</i>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Since the start of <i>Mike &amp; Molly</i>, McCarthy has lost an estimated 75Â lb (35Â kg). She credits the weight loss to a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, regular exercise, and a "super-boring life" that includes a 7:30Â p.m. bedtime.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>McCarthy is the cousin of actress, model, and television host Jenny McCarthy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>In 2013, McCarthy founded the production company On the Day with her husband Ben Falcone. <i>Tammy</i> was the new company's first project. The film cost $20 million, quite a low budget, and McCarthy, who can command close to $10 million a role, took a smaller upfront salary in exchange for a larger-than-normal cut of the film's proceeds, according to people familiar with the deal.

<p>McCarthy, who studied Textiles at Southern Illinois University, originally was interested in a career in fashion before she pursued a career in acting. When she first moved to New York City, it was to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology. One of her closest friends is shoe designer Brian Atwood. McCarthy also spent time working as the costumer for a dance company.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>Following her films, she teamed up with Sunrise Brands to manufacture her first clothing collection, Melissa McCarthy Seven7, for plus-size women. The line will include clothes up to size 28. McCarthy states that "People don't stop at size 12. I feel like there's a big thing missing where you can't dress to your mood above a certain number. Malls segregate "plus-size" clothes stores and hide these stores away from other sections of the mall. Her fashion line, Seven7, debuted in August 2015 on the Home Shopping Network, with plans for her designs to be sold in major retailers.
