The programme is intended as a stablemate for the Independent radio hit parade <i>The Network Chart Show</i>, following a similar format to the BBC's <i>Top of the Pops</i>, but its Newcastle-upon-Tyne location impinges on its ability to secure live performances. The show also suffers from poor ratings because it does not have a regular slot on the ITV network, and is cancelled in April 1988.</li>

<li>19 June – Debut of <i>The Grand Knockout Tournament</i>, an <i>It's a Knockout</i> special featuring members of the British Royal Family alongside sporting and other celebrities.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="August">August</span></h3>
<ul><li>17 August – Thames/LWT begin 24-hour broadcasting. Anglia also begins 24-hour transmissions at around the same time.</li>
<li>20 August – In the wake of the previous day's Hungerford massacre in which 16 people were shot dead by gun enthusiast Michael Ryan, the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 pull several forthcoming films and programmes containing violence from their schedules. Among them are the 1966 western <i>Nevada Smith</i>, an episode of <i>The Professionals</i> and the 1982 post-apocalyptic film <i>Battletruck</i>. A showing of <i>First Blood</i> is also cancelled.</li>

<li>US animated series <i>DuckTales</i> makes its premiere in the UK on ITV before being broadcast in the USA on Broadcast syndication several days later.</li></ul></li>
<li>14 September – After 30 years on ITV, <i>ITV Schools</i> moves to Channel 4, allowing ITV to concentrate on building a fully commercial daytime schedule. Consequently, Channel 4's weekday programming begins at 9.30am (12noon when schools programmes are not being shown).</li>
<li>21 September – As part of Channel 4's expanded weekday broadcast hours, the first edition of a weekday business and financial news programme <i>Business Daily</i> is broadcast.</li>
<li>25 September – A US version of <i>Top of the Pops</i> makes its debut on CBS in the United States, with Nia Peeples as presenter. The launch of a US <i>TOTP</i> allows American acts to more easily make live appearances on the show without the need to travel to London, while also giving British acts a chance to appear on US television as each edition includes footage from the UK series, and details of the current UK Top Ten.</li>
<li>26 September – Debut of <i>Going Live!</i>, a Saturday morning magazine show, broadcast on BBC1, and presented by Phillip Schofield and Sarah Greene.</li>
<li>30 September – BBC2 debuts Malcolm McKay's screenplay <i>The Interrogation of John</i>, a film concerning the police questioning of a potential murder suspect.

The winner of the first series, Daphne Hudson (later Daphne Fowler), receives ringside tickets at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and goes on to become a familiar face on television after appearing in a number of other quizzes, including <i>Fifteen to One</i> and <i>Eggheads</i>.</li>
<li>15 October – During a weather forecast, BBC meteorologist Michael Fish reports "Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't, but having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.". Hours later, Britain is hit by the worst storm for 284 years. Fish later drew criticism for the comments, but has since claimed that they referred to Florida, USA, and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin, but had been so widely repeated out of context that the British public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm.</li>
<li>16 October – As a result of the Great Storm of 1987, electrical power to TV-am's studios is lost and an emergency programme has to be transmitted from facilities at Thames Television's Euston Road centre using reports from TV-am's own crews and those of ITN, TSW and TVS. The BBC's <i>Breakfast Time</i>, which would usually come from Lime Grove and was able to broadcast as the studios were without power, as was most of BBC Television Centre at Wood Lane. The early part of the programme was broadcast from the continuity suite at TV Centre usually used for Children's BBC presentation as this area had generator support, before a larger studio was able to be brought into use.</li>
