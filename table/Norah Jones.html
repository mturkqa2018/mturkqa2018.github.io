<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Jones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979 in Brooklyn, New York, to American concert producer Sue Jones and Indian musician Ravi Shankar.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>After her parents separated in 1986, Norah lived with her mother, growing up in Grapevine, Texas. She attended Colleyville Middle School and Grapevine High School before transferring to Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both parents' consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Jones always had an affinity for the music of Bill Evans and Billie Holiday, among other "oldies". She once said, "My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>As a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice lessons. She still attends church. She considers herself spiritual and appreciates the rituals of her church but does not consider herself deeply religious.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>She attended Interlochen Center for the Arts during the summers. While at high school, she won the <i>Down Beat</i> Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and 1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Jones attended the University of North Texas (UNT), where she majored in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time, she had a chance meeting with future collaborator Jesse Harris. She gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country road-trip with friend and future Little Willies member Richard Julian, and stopped to see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her lead sheets of his songs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>In 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City. Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her recordings with them were bestsellers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Musical_career">Musical career</span></h2>
<p>Jones was a lounge singer before becoming a recording artist. Before releasing her first album, she performed with Wax Poetic, Peter Malick, and jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<h3><span id="2000:_The_Peter_Malick_Group_Session.2C_New_York_City"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="2000:_The_Peter_Malick_Group_Session,_New_York_City">2000: The Peter Malick Group Session, <i>New York City</i></span></h3>
<p>As Peter Malick states in the liner notes, "I started looking for a singer who could record [my latest songs] for me. On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer announced the last song of the set. The Dinah Washington classic 'Since I Fell for You' filled the room and I was struck breathless. Here, in the tradition of Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. This was my first contact with Norah Jones." Malick asked her to participate in sessions at Room 9 from Outer Space in South Boston, Massachusetts during August and September 2000. They recorded Malick's songs "New York City", "Strange Transmissions", and "Deceptively Yours" in addition to cover versions of "All Your Love" by Sam Maghett and "Heart of Mine" by Bob Dylan. These songs became the album <i>New York City</i> (Koch, 2003) by the Peter Malick Group Featuring Norah Jones.

<p>After moving to New York City, Jones signed to Blue Note, a label owned by EMI Group. The signing came as an indirect result of her performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, who was the wife of J. C. Hopkins, worked for EMI Publishing and gave Jones's three-track demo to Bruce Lundvall, the label's president, and Brian Bacchus, its artists and repertoire agent (A&amp;R). The demo contained two jazz standards and a song by Jesse Harris. The two executives agreed that Jones had potential. Despite their misgivings about the direction of her music, they signed her to the label. Bacchus told <i>HitQuarters</i>, "We let her find her own direction...We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Bacchus thought producer and engineer Jay Newland's experience in jazz, blues, rock, country, and folk music would give a "feeling for her sound." Jones and Newland recorded nine demo tracks. Four appeared on the sampler <i>First Sessions</i> (2001). The rest were set aside for her debut album. <i>Come Away with Me</i> (2002) was praised for its blend of acoustic pop with soul and jazz. Debuting at No. 139, it reached No. 1 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200. The single "Don't Know Why" hit No. 1 on the Top 40 Adult Recurrents in 2003 and No. 30 in the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 Singles Chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>At the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003, Jones was nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won five: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Don't Know Why". This tied Lauryn Hill and Alicia Keys for most Grammy Awards received by a female artist in one night. Jesse Harris won Song of the Year for "Don't Know Why" while Arif Mardin won Producer of the Year. The album won Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. <i>Come Away with Me</i> was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for having sold one million copies. On February 2005, it was certified diamond for selling ten million copies.

<p>Jones released her third album, <i>Not Too Late</i>, on January 30, 2007. The album was the first for which she wrote or co-wrote every song. She has said some of these songs are much darker than those on her previous albums. <i>Not Too Late</i> was mostly recorded at Jones' home studio. It is her first album without producer Arif Mardin, who died in the summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as "fun, relaxed and easy" and without a deadline; Blue Note executives reportedly did not know she was recording an album. The song "My Dear Country" is political commentary; she wrote it before the United States Presidential election day in 2004.
