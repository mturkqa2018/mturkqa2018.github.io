<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Shantou University (STU) was founded in 1981 and started student enrollment in 1983.  It is the only institution of higher education in the Chaoshan area.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>STU, a key comprehensive university under the provincial Project 211 program, was founded in 1981 with the approval of the State Council. As the only public university that receives long-term funding from the Li Ka Shing Foundation, it is jointly supported by the Ministry of Education, the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Li Ka Shing Foundation. The Li Ka Shing Foundation has committed and donated a total of HK$5.4 billion to support Shantou University (including the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business), of which HK$4.2 billion has already been donated as of 2012.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>STU is committed to the student-centered reform in terms of university administration and talent training, in order to cultivate talents with the motto, â€œAspiration, Knowledge, Perseverance, Achievementâ€. It is also planning to relocate the Medical College into the main campus and to develop a globally advanced curriculum focusing on life science. Since 2001, the University has conducted a profound internationalization-oriented reform, and overseas talents have been recruited to serve as provost, vice president and deans. Through a series of reforms in curriculum design, teaching, resources management and human resources system, it aims to offer a platform for the exploration of higher educational reform in China. With its successful innovations, the University was highly appraised by Comrade Li Lanqing, member of the Standing Committee of Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, as â€œthe pilot site for higher educational reform in China.â€
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>STU is strongly supported by the Central, Provincial, and Municipal authorities. The Current General secretary visited the university in the early 1990s. Former General secretary Jiang Zemin paid two visits to the university and wrote the following inscription as praise and encouragement to the staff and students: â€œThe mission is demanding and the journey ahead is long.â€ Other leaders of the Central Government have also visited the university. Among them are President Hu Jintao, Premier Li Peng, NPC(National People's Congress), Chairman Qiao Shi, CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Vice Governor of Guangdong Wang Yang.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>In 2012, the Ministry of Education, the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Li Ka Shing Foundation signed a tripartite agreement to co-develop STU. The agreement was reached to support STUâ€™s continuing reform efforts geared to an internationally renowned and nationally elite university.

<p>With a population of more than 10 million and limited land, the opportunity to create industry in Chaoshan area is limitedï¼Œand an institution of higher education was not available here for a long time. Determined to contribute to the development of his hometown, Mr. Li Ka-shing realized that cultivating capable and talented people is the key to creating and sustaining cultural and economic development in this area. University is where students are developed with critical thinking skills, broad horizons, correct values, creative ideas on science and technology, as well as professional skills. Therefore, Mr. Li decided to donate money for founding a high-level university here to cultivate talents with the motto â€œAspiration, Knowledge, Perseverance, Achievementâ€œ, hoping they can work in Chaoshan area after graduation and help to improve the living standard of Chaoshan people, to boost the economic development of the local community, and to support the development of other areas in Guangdong Province and even the whole country. With the support and assistance of the Li Ka Shing Foundation and government officials at all levels, STU has achieved rapid development in the past three decades.

<p>The STU new library, constructed with an investment from the Li Ka Shing Foundation of about 200 million RMB, was inaugurated and put into service in 2009. It is reputed as â€œthe most beautiful university library in Asiaâ€. The new library was designed by Ray Chen (é™ˆç‘žå®ª), winner of the â€œDesign for Asia Awardâ€ by Hong Kong Design Center. Built to resemble the form of a traditional â€œChinese thread-bound bookâ€, the library building also employs a modernist language with the emphasis on horizontality. The flow of space is extremely fluid and inter-penetrating. Situated at the core of the library is the Grate Hall of Reading, which serves as the spiritual center of the library and conveys a feeling of solemnity and tranquility. The upper-level bamboo courtyards and Self Study Room bring nature into the library by ushering in natural sunshine and creating a greening landscape of the traditional garden design.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>With a total area of 21,000 square meters, the library features 1500 seats and 27 seminar rooms, and also has an exhibition room, lecture hall, conference center and Student Lounge.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="STU_Sports_Park">STU Sports Park</span></h3>
<p>On June 29, 2012, a special ceremony was held to launch the STU sports arena project at its construction site. The Sports Park is designed to cover an area of 60,868.6m and has a total construction area of 52,127.4m. It includes a 6,000-seat multi-use arena, a natatorium with competitive Olympic swimming pool, sport and fitness training facilities, a flexible grand conference hall, a 200-room boutique hotel and a structured car park for 200 vehicles. The sports arena is known asâ€œHigh Parkâ€. Li Ka Shing Foundation will offer full funding for the Construction Project, which is estimated as 350 million RMB. The construction project was scheduled to be completed in 2015. The sports arena will serve as a platform in support of STUâ€™s whole-person education. While each of the above-mentioned elements is designed to work independently as an asset for the university, it is actually the way that the various program components work together that will result in a one-of-a-kind destination for the campus, community and the surrounding region. At the core of this unique concept is the enlightened philosophy of Petrarch as described in â€˜The Ascent of Mount Ventrouxâ€™: â€œIt is the realization that the journey up the mountain is more valuable to our spirit than the view from the summit.â€

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Educational_Reform">Educational Reform</span></h2>
<p>STU made great efforts to carry out the Advanced Undergraduate Education reform that mainly includes â€œIntegrative Thinkingâ€ training, integrated education model, adaptable academic programm ing, as well as evaluation and continuous improvement of teaching quality. It has developed a series of featured teaching models such as Credit System of International Standard, English Enhancement Program, CDIO approach of engineering education and system-based integrated medical curriculum. In quest of a unique educational model, STU made tremendous efforts to integrate such educational aspects as community service, liberal arts and sportsmanship into its holistic approach to talent training.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Credit_System_of_International_Standard">Credit System of International Standard</span></h3>
<p>In 2002, STU implemented a credit system similar to those that have been proved successful for universities in developed countries, which provides students greater opportunities to choose a wider range of elective courses. This reform will provide STI students with more freedom in selecting courses and may lead to the establishment of a new interdisciplinary curriculum.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Enhancement_Program">English Enhancement Program</span></h3>
<p>In May 2002, the English Language Center (ELC) was set up and the â€œEnglish Enhancement Programâ€ was initiated to reform English language teaching designed for university-wide students who would like to pass CET.The objective of the program is to make the students better at communication, critical thinking and innovation with the use of English. The measure is to teach the students how to think and communicate in English through teaching and learning exchanges, and help the students develop their skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing, etc. by organizing extra-curricular activities involving the use of English.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">58</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="EIP-CDIO_Approach_of_Engineering_Education">EIP-CDIO Approach of Engineering Education</span></h3>
<p>In 2005, upon thorough investigations on CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement and Operate) approach and local needs in China, and referring to the successful experience of engineering educational reform in Canada, STU decided to adopt the CDIO Initiative. To adapt to the local needs, the University determined to use a design directed EIP-CDIP approach. EIP stands for Ethics, Integrity and Professionalism. In 2006, STU became the first CDIO member among Chinese universities. In 2010, STU was selected by the Ministry of Education to be among the first group of universities to conduct the â€œOutstanding Engineer Education Programâ€.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Integrative_Thinking">Integrative Thinking</span></h3>
<p>In Fall Semester 2011, STU began to offer â€œIntegrative Thinkingâ€ (IT) courses to freshmen. The courses were designed to provide students with different learning experiences and to develop their integrative thinking ability and lifelong learning ability.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International_Accreditation_for_Undergraduate_Programs">International Accreditation for Undergraduate Programs</span></h3>
<p>STU continued to promote its work concerning international accreditation for its undergraduate programs. In 2011, the Business Schoolâ€™s BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) program was granted EFMD Programme Accreditation System (EPAS) accreditation, the first university in Asia to pass this kind of accreditation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Whole-person_Education">Whole-person Education</span></h3>
<p>In 2012, Shantou University set a vision for developing studentsâ€™ STU-DNA in support of the Holistic or Whole-person Education. This was a first for the university. By mainly offering general-education courses, service-learning activities and quality development projects, it gradually instilled the educational idea of the 4Cs (Culture, Civility, Character, Care) into every aspect of talent training. In 2008, STU established the first full-range residential college for undergraduate students in mainlan China, Veritas College, where students from different majors live together to share different thoughts. Establishing Veritas College is for the purpose of enabling the university to nurture â€œwhole-personsâ€ who are tailor-made for the society instead of merely imparting expert knowledge.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>STU made tremendous efforts to integrate such educational aspects as community service, liberal arts and sportsmanship into its holistic approach to talent training. The University initiated compulsory community service courses to expand the application of the service-learning model. It was advocated that such courses should be connected to service-learning activities. The aim was to help students achieving all-round development, and to strengthen their sense of social responsibility and dedication. Since 2009, with support from the Li Ka Shing Foundation, STU carried out various quality development programs for students, such as Outdoor Training Camp on Nan-Ao Island, an expedition at Mt. Shishapangma, as well as community-service activities and expeditions at Brahmaputra River and Hoh Xil. Through launching these quality development programs, developing a high-quality STU basketball team and organizing student sporting activities, the University aims to cultivate studentsâ€™ sportsmanship.
