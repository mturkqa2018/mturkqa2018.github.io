<p>A <b>respiratory therapist</b> is a specialized healthcare practitioner trained in pulmonary medicine in order to work therapeutically with people suffering from pulmonary disease.  Respiratory therapists graduate from a community college or university 
with a certification in respiratory therapy and have passed a national board certifying examination.  The NBRC (National Board for Respiratory Care) is the not-for-profit organization responsible for credentionaling the seven areas of Respiratory Therapy.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Those seven areas of Respiratory Therapy include, as of December 2017: CRT (Certified Respiratory Therapist), RRT (Registered Respiratory Therapist), CPFT and RPFT (Certified or Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist), ACCS (Adult Critical Care Specialist), NPS (Neonatal/Pediatric Specialist), and SDS (Sleep Disorder Specialist).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Respiratory therapists work in hospitals in the intensive care units (Adult, Pediatric, and Neonatal), on hospital floors, in Emergency Departments, in Pulmonay Functioning laboratories (PFTs), are able to intubate patients, work in sleep labs (polysomnograpy) (PSG) labs, and in home care specifically DME (Durable Medical Equipment) and home oxygen.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Respiratory therapists are specialists and educators in many areas including cardiology, pulmonology, and sleep therapy.  Respiratory therapists are clinicians trained in advanced airway management; establishing and maintaining the airway during management of trauma, and intensive care.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>Respiratory therapists initiate and manage life support for people in intensive care units and emergency departments, stabilizing, treating and managing pre-hospital and hospital-to-hospital patient transport by air or ground ambulance.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In the outpatient setting respiratory therapists work as educators in asthma clinics, ancillary clinical staff in pediatric clinics, and sleep-disorder diagnosticians in sleep-clinics, they also serve as clinical providers in cardiology clinics and cath-labs, as well as working in pulmonary rehabilitation.

<p>Respiratory therapists educate, diagnose, and treat people who are suffering from heart and lung problems.  Specialized in both cardiac and pulmonary care, Respiratory Therapists often collaborate with specialists in pulmonology and anaesthesia in various aspects of clinical care of patients. Respiratory therapists provide a vital role in both medicine and nursing. A vital role in ICU is the initiation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation and the care of artificial airways.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p>
<dl><dt>Outpatient clinical practice</dt></dl>
<p>Respiratory therapists are also primary clinicians in conducting tests to measure lung function and teaching people to manage asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder among other cardiac and lung functions.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Internationally, Respiratory Therapists that provide lung function testing are termed respiratory scientists, but in North America, they may be a Respiratory Therapist or may also be a certified pulmonary function technician in the United States.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<dl><dt>Home-health care</dt></dl>
<p>Outside of clinics and hospitals, Respiratory Therapists often manage home oxygen needs of patients and their families, providing around the clock support for home ventilators and other equipment for conditions like sleep apnea.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In the clinic or outpatient setting Respiratory Therapists assist with diagnosis and serve as an educator for patients suffering from cardiac and respiratory illness.   In the United States, Respiratory Therapists with certification as Registered Respiratory Therapists evaluate and treat patients with a great deal of autonomy under the direction of a pulmonologist.  In facilities that maintain critical care transport teams Respiratory Therapists are a preferred addition to all types of surface or air transport.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p>
<dl><dt>Public education</dt></dl>
<p>In other settings Respiratory Therapists are found in schools as asthma educators, working with teachers and coaches about childhood symptoms of asthma and how to spot an emergency. In the United States, legislation has been introduced several times to allow Respiratory Therapists certified as asthma specialists with registered Respiratory Therapist certification to prescribe and manage previously diagnosed respiratory patients in physician clinics.  In sleep clinics, Respiratory Therapists work with physicians in the diagnosis of sleep-related illnesses.   Respiratory Therapists in the United States are migrating toward a role with autonomy similar to the nurse practitioner, or as an extension of the physician like the physician assistant.  Respiratory Therapists are frequently utilized as complete cardiovascular specialists being utilized to place and manage arterial accesses along with peripherally-inserted central catheters.

<dl><dt>Pulmonary rehabilitation</dt></dl>
<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation may be initiated as a treatment as a source for continuity of improvement after a hospital stay or as a therapeutic way to increase quality of life.   Pulmonary rehabilitation is intended to educate the patient, the family, and improve the overall quality of life and prognosis for the patient.   Pulmonary Rehabilitation involves therapies and evaluations by Respiratory Therapists, Occupational Therapists and Physical Therapists.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Credentialing_and_licensure">Credentialing and licensure</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States_and_Canada">United States and Canada</span></h3>
<p>In the United States and Canada, Respiratory Therapists are healthcare practitioners who, after receiving at least an Associate of Science in Respiratory Care, complete a credentialing process.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>After satisfactorily completing the required examinations and being added to a registry, the practitioner is then eligible to apply for a license to practice in the region governed by their respective licensing body.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>In the United States, specialist Respiratory Therapists are clinicians who hold National Board for Respiratory Care specialty credentials, which may include neonatal/pediatric specialist (CRT-NPS or RRT-NPS), adult critical care specialist (RRT-ACCS), sleep disorder specialist (CRT-SDS or RRT-SDS), and pulmonary function technologist (CPFT or RPFT). The NBRC's RRT-ACCS examination is the newest NBRC examination: it was introduced in 2012.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Professional credentials denoted as a certified Asthma Educator (AE-C) may also be earned by passing the National Asthma Educator Certification Board (NAECB).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In some parts of Canada, one may practice as a Provisional Respiratory Therapist after graduating, until writing and passing the CBRC exam. In Canada, similar credentialing and advanced training exists.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="International_respiratory_care">International respiratory care</span></h2>
<p>Except for the United States and Canada, very few countries have a dedicated professional role for respiratory health. In these countries, respiratory care is provided by physiotherapists, nurses and physicians that have chosen to specialize in this field.  In many countries this recognition is in a transition stage; as an example, in 2011, hospitals in Beijing, China began a recruitment drive to acquire Respiratory Therapists for their intensive care units where previously nurses were the only clinician.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canada">Canada</span></h3>
<p>Upon graduation from an accredited school of respiratory therapy, the graduate is then eligible to write the national exam administered by the Canadian Board for Respiratory Care.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Success on this examination will then allow the Respiratory Therapist to register with any licensing body in Canada.  Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan are the Canadian provinces with provincial licensing bodies; in these provinces, it is illegal to practice the profession of Respiratory Care without first being licensed as a full or provisional member with the provincial licensing body.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>These provinces are so-called regulated provinces.  In some provinces, one may work provisionally upon graduating, until writing and passing the exam. In all other jurisdictions, the licensing body for the profession of Respiratory Care is the Canadian Society for Respiratory Therapy.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Registration as a full member is optional for Respiratory Therapists living in regulated provinces, however, for Respiratory Therapists living in non-regulated provinces, registration as a full member with the CSRT is compulsory.  Registration with the provincial regulatory body or the CSRT (in non-regulated provinces) confers upon the Respiratory Therapist the title of Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT). Canada and the United States recognize each their cardio-pulmonary education structure as equal, however a qualifying exam must be written in order to practice in either nation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>There is pressure for the program to become a degree, as other therapies (Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy) now require a master's degree or greater.  However, in some places such as Alberta, Canada the cardio-pulmonary course work are only offered at technical schools which are unable to grant a formal degree.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="France">France</span></h3>
<p>Respiratory therapy is a sub-specialty of physical therapy in France.   Respiratory care as a specialty is regulated by the Fédération Française des Masseurs Kinésithérapeutes Rééducateurs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Germany">Germany</span></h3>
<p>The German Respiratory Society first issued a resolution to develop the dedicated Respiratory Therapist (RT) role in 2004 as a means to increase the quality of patient care, delegate physician duties and respond to the observed increase in respiratory conditions and diseases. In 2006, a year-long pilot training program was offered to established nurses and physiotherapists.  Researchers report that significant
additional work is necessary to define and position the role of the Respiratory Therapist within the current healthcare system.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">27</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Italy">Italy</span></h3>
<p>In Italy, the title of the Respiratory Therapist can be acquired applying to the Master's degree in Respiratory Therapy. It consists of frontal lessons and various internships throughout Italian hospitals.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philippines">Philippines</span></h3>
<p>In Philippines Respiratory Therapists are clinicians who have been awarded at minimum a Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care degree.  Licenses to practice respiratory care are regulated by the Professional Regulatory Board of Respiratory Therapy and Professional Regulation Commission which is established and legally maintained by the Philippine Respiratory Therapy Act (Republic Act No.  10024).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Arab_Emirates">United Arab Emirates</span></h3>
<p>In United Arab Emirates Respiratory Therapists must have been awarded a Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care.   An additional two-years of experience is required for foreign applicants.   Licenses are maintained and awarded by the Dubai Health Authority.   The Dubai Health Authority restricts Respiratory Therapists to working only in physical medicine and rehabilitation Centers, in hospitals, in surgical clinics with cardio-thoracic surgeons and with physicians in family/general practice or pulmonology.

<p>In the United States a Respiratory Therapist is a clinician who has at a minimum completed an Associate of Science in Respiratory Care degree along with a certification process.  After satisfactorily completing required examinations either administered by the National Board for Respiratory Care or directly by the individual state licensing board (either the medical examiners board or a special state respiratory care board), the practitioner is then eligible to apply for a license to practice in the region governed by their respective licensing body..
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>There are two recognized governing bodies in the United States: the State Board of Respiratory Care in the state in which a Respiratory Therapist is licensed to practice and the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC), a non-profit organization which regulates two levels of certification along with some additional specialist certifications.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>The Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) is the certification given after successfully passing the Therapist Multiple Choice NBRC-TMC exam; the Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) certification is given after first making the RRT cutting score on the TMC exam, and passing the Clinical Simulation Exam NBRC-CSE.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">34</span></p><p>Most state boards of respiratory care require proof of the appropriate NBRC credential and award various license titles, including (but not limited to) Respiratory Care Practitioner, Licensed Registered Respiratory Therapist, and Licensed Certified Respiratory Therapist.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">35</span></p><p>There has been a substantial push to standardize the state licensure by the American Association for Respiratory Care.  The NBRC credential is renewed every 5 years for a fee in addition to fees assessed by the state boards of respiratory care.

<p>The traditional role of the operating room Respiratory Therapist has included providing technical support to the anesthesiologist for the proper use and maintenance of the anesthetic gas machine, in addition to also providing airway management.  This role in the operating room has evolved to include a more advanced and specialized role with increasing responsibilities to the Respiratory Therapist.  Respiratory Therapists are academically prepared to perform activities such as sedation by administration of anesthetic gases and medications, insertion and management of vascular (arterial and venous) access and assessment of the depth of anesthesia under the guidance of an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist.  This role is similar to the nurse anesthetist, except that an Anesthesia Assistant must have an anesthesiologist supervising them and a nurse anesthetist, does not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_respiratory_care">History of respiratory care</span></h2>
<p>The profession of respiratory care was officially established in the United States c. 1930; and respiratory research has officially existed since the early 1900s.  During the early years, Respiratory Therapists were referred to as "oxygen technicians", and most of their activities involved moving cylinders of compressed gas and administering oxygen via nasal catheter or oxygen tent.  Most oxygen technicians were trained on the job, although brief training programs began to appear in the late 1940s and 1950s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">55</span></p><p>Today the profession hardly resembles what it was in the 1940s.  Respiratory Therapists provide direct care, patient education, and care coordination.   They are academically trained in respiratory nursing and respiratory medicine.   They practice in acute care facilities, long-term acute care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, assisted-living centers, subacute care units, rehabilitation centers, diagnostics units, and in the home.  Respiratory Therapist training has also dramatically changed.  Current accreditation standards require Respiratory Therapists to have, at minimum, an Associate of Science in Respiratory Care degree from an accredited program.  Legal requirements to practice respiratory therapy have also dramatically changed.   49 states now legally recognize Respiratory Therapists.  Limited permits or state licenses are now required in all states except Alaska, which has no statutory authority over the practice of respiratory care.   Most states that have a licensure requirement also require continuing education.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>In 2007 the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) began developing recommendations for the promotion of the field of respiratory care in the United States in response to increased concern regarding licensure and credentialing issues as well as international recognition of those practicing in the United States.  The task force decided to recommend that by 2015 the minimum education requirement for licensure and certification as a Respiratory Therapist be a bachelor of science in respiratory therapy (BSRT).  The AARC task force also recommended the American Respiratory Care Foundation change its scholarship policies and only award assistance and grants to those working toward a bachelor's degree.   The Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC) was asked by the AARC task force to change its accreditation standards and no longer accredit associates level respiratory care programs.  The CoARC replied by a press release rejecting the recommendation.  In 2011 legislation introduced by the AARC will help improve the use of Respiratory Therapists in clinical applications by allowing them to manage patients suffering from asthma and COPD seeing a clinic for routine checkups. Similar bills have been introduced before and have died in committee.
