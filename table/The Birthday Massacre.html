<p><b>The Birthday Massacre</b> (abbreviated TBM) is a Canadian rock band, formed in 1999 in London, Ontario, and currently based in Toronto, Ontario. The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Chibi, rhythm guitarist Rainbow, lead guitarist Falcore, drummer Rhim, keyboardist Owen, and bassist Nate Manor.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>When the band formed in 1999, they were known as <b>Imagica</b>. This name was inspired from the fantasy novel <i>Imajica</i> (1991) by Clive Barker. In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song "The Birthday Massacre" was then renamed to "Happy Birthday". According to their vocalist Chibi: "it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>TBM have released seven studio albums: <i>Nothing and Nowhere</i> (2002), <i>Violet</i> (2005), <i>Walking With Strangers</i> (2007), <i>Pins and Needles</i> (2010), <i>Hide and Seek</i> (2012), <i>Superstition</i> (2014) and <i>Under Your Spell</i> (2017)
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>They also issued the DVD <i>Blue</i> (2005), the live album/DVD <i>Show and Tell</i> (2009), the demo album <i>Imagica</i>, and the EPs <i>Violet</i> (2004), <i>Looking Glass</i> (2008), <i>Imaginary Monsters</i> (2011).

<p>The group originated in London, Ontario, under the name <b>Imagica</b>, with members using pseudonyms and nicknames instead of their birth names. The group's original lineup formed when Rainbow met Chibi at Fanshawe College, studying in the same fine-arts program. The two decided to start a band for fun as they were already hanging around writing music together. Rainbow recruited childhood friend Michael Falcore to join on guitar since they had already been recording music together in high school. Aslan, who was also attending the same college, became roommates with Rainbow and joined on bass. In mid 2000, Dank, a long-time friend of Chibi's, joined to play live keyboards but left the group shortly before they relocated to Toronto.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>After months of rehearsals and writing songs, they played their first gig on October 28, 2000, at Diversity night club in London. The band released a seven-song limited-edition demo CD at the show which had been recorded on a four-track cassette recorder during a time when the group was recording cover songs for fun. There were 40 hand-numbered copies of the demo which included the first recorded version of the song "The Birthday Massacre" (later renamed "Happy Birthday").
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>During this time, the band also met Rhim, Owen and Brett Carruthers who all attended the same college. In addition to this, later in October 2006, Terry McManus, Professor of Music Business and Entertainment Law at Fanshawe College, would join as the band's personal manager.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Since its inception, The Birthday Massacre have described the band as an audio-visual project. In a 2009 interview, when asked about why they had started the band, Rainbow stated: "I think more than just being a band, it's a way to sort of incorporate, not just music, but other things. So I think more so than just music, the idea of having a band, and being able to perform, and being able to do artwork, to do music... all these different avenues." Neither Rainbow, Chibi nor Michael Falcore had been in any previous bands and have expressed in multiple interviews that the group formed naturally as a result of spending time together as friends.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p>
<h3><span id="Nothing_.26_Nowhere_.282001.E2.80.9303.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Nothing_&amp;_Nowhere_(2001–03)"><i>Nothing &amp; Nowhere</i> (2001–03)</span></h3>
<p>In 2001, the band relocated to Toronto, except for Michael Falcore who was already living in Toronto studying video production.  They began recording a new album which they announced would be available through the official website beginning May 31, 2002, in another limited edition of 500 to 1,000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Shortly before releasing the CD, the band opted to change their name from <b>Imagica</b> to <b>The Birthday Massacre</b> in order to avoid confusion with a California death metal band with the same name. The band chose the name since people were already familiar with the song of the same title.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>In July 2002, the Birthday Massacre independently released a limited-edition CD entitled <i>Nothing and Nowhere</i>. In 2003, Adm joined the band on live keyboards and O.E left to focus on his own band Tepid Lust, later to become Isle of Dogs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>The band began playing more live shows in London, Toronto, Oshawa and Montreal. Rhim was drumming for the band during these years, rotating between playing for fellow London band Aphasia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>On February 9, 2005, Rhim posted on his LiveJournal that he was now a permanent member of The Birthday Massacre and that the band has his "110% unwavering, full-throttle, metronomic fabulousness... now 24-7."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>2003 also saw the creation of the band's Flash website NothingAndNowhere.com., designed by Aslan and the band which included unreleased music and hidden objects throughout the site.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p><p>While studying fine arts, the group learned about color theory and chose the color violet to represent the band's themes. Rainbow said in an early interview: "Violet is the color of the tragic comedy. We associate it with fantasy and melancholy. These themes make up much of the band's lyrical inspiration. The color also mirrors our sound dynamic. Our music mixes contrasting elements. In turn, violet is the sum of two contrasting colors: Red and Blue." The band established their signature sound and visuals during this time and later when they signed to their labels retained complete artistic freedom.

<p>On July 20, 2004, the Birthday Massacre again independently released an EP, <i>Violet</i>, and at the end of the year, re-released <i>Nothing</i> with new sleeve artwork. In the fall of 2004, Kai Schmidt, former member of electronic group Funker Vogt, signed the band to his label in Germany. They released a remastered and expanded LP version of <i>Violet</i> in Europe, including updated album art in a Digipak case. Adm left the band shortly before signing to Repo Records and can be seen in the original group photo on the nine song EP but is absent in the Digipak and LP version. In 2004, Brett Carruthers briefly joined the band on live keyboards. 2004 saw the band touring outside of Canada for the first time, playing the states of New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland performing with American bands 51 Peg, Deadstar Assembly, Celldweller and Crossbreed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>In 2005, the band signed to Metropolis Records and re-released <i>Violet</i>. In August, the band began a series of international tours taking them to Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic, Belgium, Spain and UK. Also in August the band released a DVD with the video for <i>Blue</i> by Dan Ouellette. Owen joined on keyboards first assuming the name Waffles, then O-en, then finally using his given name. Owen previously met the Birthday Massacre when playing in another band called Electric Knife Fight and joined just after the <i>Blue</i> filming was completed and therefore missed making an appearance in the video. On New Year's Eve the band performed in Los Angeles, California, at Bar Sinister.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>In early 2006, the Birthday Massacre toured North America, playing across Canada, the United States and Mexico on their "Broken Minds" tour sharing the stage with KMFDM, Schoolyard Heroes, Suicide City and the Start. They toured Europe again with bands Das Ich, Jesus on Extasy and Dope Stars Inc; playing in France, Italy, and Poland's Castle Party 2006.  Through its European debut, <i>Violet</i> ranked high in the alternative charts. In several countries, the band made it onto the front pages of magazines; performing at some of Germany's largest music festivals, including the annual Highfeild and M'era Luna summer festivals. Also in 2006 the band recorded a remix of the song "Straight to Video" by Mindless Self Indulgence. Later in 2008, the band would record a second remix, this time of the song <i>Never Wanted to Dance</i> with the addition of Chibi's vocals.

<p>On January 1, 2007, a demo version of the song "Kill the Lights" was released for streaming on the band's Vampirefreaks profile, which remained for several years the number one ranked profile for the highest number of listeners. In June, the band announced it was working on a new record with Canadian producer and engineer Dave "Rave" Ogilvie and that Aslan was leaving to start a new project and that O.E would be returning to the lineup on bass duties. In August, the band began planning a new video to be directed again by Dan Ouellette.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>On September 11, 2007, the band released Walking with Strangers in North America, entering at No. 10 on the Billboard "Top Heatseekers" chart for September 29. The album was released in Europe on September 21 and in the UK on 22 October. Artwork was created by JUNO Award winner, Vincent Marcone of Johnny Hollow. In October and November, the band toured Europe and the U.K with German band Psycho Luna.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>Primary filming of the <i>Looking Glass</i> video took place February 10–11, 2008, directed by Ouellette. Extras were culled from The Birthday Massacre’s fan base and all 35 masks were handcrafted. The Looking Glass video was released on the band's official YouTube channel on April 1, 2008, and distributed as a video data file on the EP which was released in May 2008. It contained several remixes by electronic artists such as Dean Garcia, Jamie Miller and Dave Ogilvie. Beginning in June, the band embarked on a large American tour, opening up for Mindless Self Indulgence, and sharing shows with Julien-K, Fake Shark - Real Zombie!, London After Midnight and Combichrist. They would further tour America with bands Tub Ring, Hollowboy and Creature Feature. November 2008 also saw the band touring Australia for the first time.

<p>The Birthday Massacre have utilized the Internet throughout their career and are an example of a musical group that has evolved alongside file sharing, and advancements in audio streaming capabilities. Initially, the band distributed their music for free, using music sharing software Napster, in addition to sharing their music on MP3.com and their official websites. The band was active in updating their websites regularly, interacting with fans on their forum, and offering their site in multiple languages like French, German and Japanese. Early on the band encouraged fans to create their own content, and consequently the band saw a surge in fan-created content, which they organized on a webring called Violetprison.com, posting in 2003; "We want our fans to contribute and be involved so rather than telling newcomers who we are, we would rather our fans tell you."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">36</span></p><p>In 2006. a Chicago-based Birthday Massacre street team put out a concert film from their US tour. It was shot in secret as a present to congratulate the band for completing a full tour of the United States. After a trailer for the film sparked Internet interest, the band's management agreed to allow the entire film's release. Called The Birthday Massacre Bootleg, it was re-released in high definition with 5.1 surround in January 2015. The band returned thanks to the producers in the liner notes of Walking with Strangers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">37</span></p><p>When asked about how the band uses the Internet, Rainbow said in a 2009 interview: "It's also a way to you know, not just present the music, but make an environment, a visual environment around the music, which was something we were really interested in." When asked about File sharing, Chibi said in a 2010 interview: "It's like the best friend of a band when you're starting up... But then, it's like the worst enemy... The Internet can take you so far." Falcore says in a 2010 interview: "Once it's released people start downloading for free and not paying for it, you know, it hurts the artist." The band has remained popular for over a decade despite receiving very little mainstream press or radio play, referring to themselves as the "Black sheep" of the Canadian music scene.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Views">Views</span></h2>
<p>When asked in an interview by PETA, what she thought about factory farming being the number one cause of global warming, Chibi said: "Our manager is really on the politicians about factory farming in Southwestern Ontario. Besides the cruelty to the animals, the runoff of the manure in the spring with the heavy rains is making the coastline of Lake Huron a disaster zone. He tells me that the beautiful stretch of sand dunes and beaches around Pinery Provincial Park and well north of Grand Bend (the big resort town), gets posted for no swimming half the summer. It should probably be posted all the time until they dismantle the factory farms in Huron County."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">39</span></p><p>When asked in a video interview by TasteitTV about having to conform to society, Rainbow says: "...A lot of the inspirations and themes in the lyrics, and even in the imagery is sort of childhood, and you know that perspective of when you're younger... you lose a bit of that sense of wonder and mystery, which is really inspiring and gives you a lot of energy when you're younger." Chibi follows by saying: "You have to be an adult, and you have to conform in certain ways because you have responsibilities now, whereas when you were a child, all you had to do is play games and lay in the grass, you know what I mean?"
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">40</span></p><p>On the <i>Blairing Out With Eric Blair</i> show, when asked about what kind of advice Chibi would give to somebody who was thinking about committing suicide, Chibi responds: "Just ride it out because things can get better. When I think back to times in my life when I was having a horrible time, like I hated high school, I was unpopular, the whole thing. It became so irrelevant. It's like if you just give things time, you'll be like, what was I worried about five years ago? Nothing's that relevant."
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>In March 2013, the band announced their support for same-sex marriage and LGBT rights.
