<p>The <b>2014 Bahrain GP2 Series round</b> was a pair of motor races held on 5 and 6 April 2014 at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain as part of the GP2 Series. It was the first round of the 2014 GP2 Series and was run in support of the 2014 Bahrain Grand Prix. The first race, a 32-lap feature event, was won by ART Grand Prix driver Stoffel Vandoorne after starting from second position. Julián Leal finished second for the Carlin team and DAMS driver Jolyon Palmer came in third. Palmer won the second race, a 23-lap sprint event, ahead of Rapax driver Simon Trummer in second and Leal third.
<a name="text3"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></a></p><p>Palmer took pole position in the feature race by recording the fastest lap in qualifying, but after a poor start caused by wheelspin, he was beaten to the first corner by Vandoorne. A lap three crash between Axcil Jefferies and Kimiya Sato saw the safety car deployed for the next three laps and Vandoorne kept the lead at the restart. He retained it until his pit stop on the ninth lap. Nathanaël Berthon took the lead for nine laps before Trummer took over the position until his lap 30 pit stop. Vandoorne thus regained the position and maintained it to win the feature race. Felipe Nasr started from pole position in the sprint race but lost it to Trummer because of a slow getaway. Palmer passed Trummer for the lead on the second lap and held it to win.
<a name="text4"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></a></p><p>Vandoorne's feature race victory was his first in the GP2 Series and it occurred in his maiden series start and Palmer's sprint race win was the fourth of his career. The result of the races meant Palmer assumed the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 38 points, ten in front of second-placed Leal. Vandoorne was in third place, while Trummer's second-place sprint race result enabled him to settle into fourth. Nasr rounded out the top five. DAMS became the leaders of the Teams' Championship with a four-point advantage over Carlin. ART Grand Prix were a further seven points in third position, while Rapax and Racing Engineering rounded out the top five, with ten rounds left in the season.

<p>The 2014 Bahrain GP2 Series round was the first of eleven scheduled events in 2014. It was held on 5 and 6 April 2014 at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, and was run in support of the 2014 Bahrain Grand Prix. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought two types of tyre to the race: two dry compounds (yellow-banded soft "options" and orange-banded hard "primes").
<a name="text6"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></a></p><p>The final mass test session before the new season took place at the track over 19–21 March. On the first day, Daniel Abt (Hilmer Motorsport) set the fastest lap of the morning session with a time of one minute and 40.676 seconds which saw the session twice disrupted when Takuya Izawa (ART Grand Prix) stopped on track and Simon Trummer (Rapax) abandoned his car after hitting the turn ten kerb. Alexander Rossi (Caterham Racing) set the quickest lap of the day in the afternoon session with a one-minute and 40.604 seconds lap. Rio Haryanto (Caterham Racing) recorded the fastest lap of the three days, a one-minute and 39.129 seconds in the second day's morning session, and Daniël de Jong (MP Motorsport) paced the afternoon session with a time of one minute and 40.508 seconds. In the third (and final) day, Jon Lancaster (MP Motorsport) was the fastest driver in the morning session with a lap of one minute and 39.693 seconds, and Abt was quickest in the afternoon session with a time of one minute and 41.061 seconds.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Practice_and_qualifying">Practice and qualifying</span></h3>
<p>One 45-minute practice session was held on Friday before the two races. In the practice session, held in windy conditions and on a dusty track, Russian Time's Mitch Evans was fastest with a time of 1 minute and 42.062 seconds, six-hundredths of a second faster than ART Grand Prix's Stoffel Vandoorne in second. Raffaele Marciello of Racing Engineering was third-fastest, ahead of Abt, Stéphane Richelmi for DAMS and Haryanto. André Negrão of Arden International was seventh-fastest, Jolyon Palmer in the second DAMS car was eighth, Trummer ninth and Conor Daly's Lazarus vehicle completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Julián Leal understeered off the track and into turn eleven; he spun off two corners later. Facu Regalia slid under braking and went into the turn thirteen run-off area, while Rossi locked his tyres and ran wide at turn eleven. With two minutes remaining, de Jong stopped in the run-off area leaving the first turn and practice ended early because of the limited amount of time available.

<p>Friday evening's qualifying session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. In contrast to previous years, qualifying was held in night time conditions, the first such occurrence in the GP2 Series. The track was less dusty than it had been in practice, and multiple drivers had pole position throughout the half hour session. Palmer clinched his first pole position of the season and the second of his GP2 Series career with a time of 1 minute and 38.865 seconds. He flat spotted his first set of tyres and was aware the second set equipped would aid his challenge for the pole position. Palmer was joined on the grid's front row by Vandoorne who recorded a lap three-hundredths of second slower. Vandoorne was temporarily investigated by the stewards for exceeding track limits at turn thirteen, but no action was prompted. Abt took third having been unable to improve on his lap time. Richelmi improved towards the end of the session and secured fourth. Haryanto took fifth ahead of sixth-placed Stefano Coletti. Early pace setter Evans fell to seventh as others bettered their lap times.
<a name="text9"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></a></p><p>In the session's closing minutes, Carlin's Felipe Nasr was on a fast lap and closed up to Johnny Cecotto Jr.'s slow Trident car on the racing line while driving through the fourth corner and appeared to execute an sudden manoeuvre resulting in Nasr gesticulating to Cecotto. The stewards deemed Nasr at fault and he was handed a three-grid penalty. Hence, Marciello, Arthur Pic (Campos Racing) and Lancaster rounded out the top ten. Leal was the fastest driver not to have received a penalty who was unable to qualify in the top ten; his best time of 1 minute and 39.588 seconds was 0.723 seconds off Palmer's pace. He was followed by Cecotto and Negrão in the next two spots. Rossi could not replicate his earlier form and could only muster a 15th place start. Kimiya Sato (Campos Racing) was 16th and was closely followed by René Binder (Arden International) and Daly. Regalia was restricted to 19th and Nathanaël Berthon (Lazarus) was 20th. Trummer qualified in 21st position. He was followed by de Jong who spun under braking with cold tyres late in the session. Izaka was 23th and was joined on the grid's twelfth row by Adrian Quaife-Hobbs (Rapax). 25th-place starter Axcil Jefferies (Trident) lost control of his car's rear while others got their tyres to their optimum temperature early on. Artem Markelov (Russian Time) started from the back of the grid after spinning on cold tyres. This was caused by him running over the turn one kerb. Markelov stalled his car and the session was red flagged to enable the extraction of  his vehicle from the racing line by marshals.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Races">Races</span></h3>
<p>The first race was held over a distance of either 170 kilometres (110 mi) or 60 minutes (which ever came first) and all drivers were mandated to make one pit stop. The first ten finishers scored points, with two being awarded to the competitor who recorded the fastest lap. The starting order for the second race was determined by the finishing positions of the first race but with the first eight drivers in reverse order of where they finished. It was run over a distance of either 120 kilometres (75 mi) or 45 minutes (which ever came first) and in contrast to the first race drivers were not required to make pit stops. The top eight finishers scored points towards their respective championships.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Feature_race">Feature race</span></h4>
<p>Weather conditions at the start of the first race on 5 April were dry and sunny with an air temperature of 27 °C (81 °F) and a track temperature at 52 °C (126 °F). All of the leaders started on the soft compound tyres. Tyre degradation was predicted to be a major factor in the event, and Pirelli believed that the hard compound tyre would last an entire race without any issue, although most of the lower starting drivers were using this tyre and anticipation was high for them to create traffic problems. Trummer stalled as the formation lap began and was required to start from the pit lane. When the race commenced at 13:10 Arabia Standard Time (UTC+3), Palmer spun his wheels leaving the grid and Vandoorne took advantage of this handicap to lead the field heading into the first corner. Richelmi and Coletti passed Palmer and Abt to move into second and third places. Regalia battled for position on the first lap but sustained a broken front suspension from an impact with Cecotto after exiting turn four which forced Regalia to end his race prematurely. Palmer fell to sixth and battled Nasr for the position. Evans executed a successful overtaking manoeuvre on Haryanto for fourth place at the first turn at the start of the second lap.

<p>On the following lap, a large crash necessitated the deployment of the safety car. Jefferies was defending his position from Sato on the straight linking turns three and four and Sato went into Jefferies's rear. Sato punted Jefferies into a heavy collision with the wall lining the circuit at high speed. Jefferies's vehicle then slid across the tarmac at turn one and stopped in the gravel trap without collecting any other cars. Jefferies was unhurt. At the lap six restart, Vandoorne remained the leader but Richelmi, Coletti, Haryanto and Nasr elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change to the hard compound tyre. Evans and Palmer made their pit stops on the following lap, though Vandoorne committed himself to making track position pay off and extended his advantage to five seconds in front of Pic. Richelmi lost positions but his teammate Palmer moved back up the field and into third place. Nasr became disgruntled when Cecotto forced him to the side of the track while battling for position. Vandoorne ceded first to Berthon at the end of lap nine when he made his pit stop and rejoined with a two-second advantage over Palmer.
<a name="text13"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></a></p><p>Haryanto demoted Coletti to take over fourth place at the first corner. Sato took a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 13 for his role in the lap three accident with Jeffries. Trummer took advantage of a battle between Binder and Izawa and passed the duo with the same passing manoeuvre in the opening corners for third place on the 14th lap. He passed Daly for second position two laps later. Bertbon entered the pit lane from the lead on lap 18 and narrowly avoided colliding with Trummer as he attempted to enter the pit lane. After leaving the pit lane, Berthon was affected by wheel nut problem that caused him to slow with a suspected loose wheel before returning to the pit lane. Leal was heavily delayed by Markelov allowing Palmer to pull away. Meanwhile, Trummer stayed on track and lost small amounts of his pace by pushing hard. Vandoorne reduced Trummer's lead to eight seconds by the time Trummer made his pit stop at the end of lap 30. He was followed by Coletti, Pic and Nasr with the late-stopping Quaife-Hobbs and Izama moving through the field courtesy of having newer soft compound tyres installed on their cars.
<a name="text14"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></a></p><p>Leal attacked Palmer and passed him by braking later than he did around the inside at turn one for second position. Trummer emerged from the pit lane in tenth with two laps left and had the advantage of the newest set of soft compound tyres enabling him to move ahead of Quaife-Hobbs, Nasr and Binder on the final lap and settle for seventh place. Vandoorne maintained his advantage at the head of the field and crossed the start/finish line after completing 32 laps to win his maiden GP2 Series race on his debut. Leal finished second, one and a half seconds behind and Palmer fended off attacks from Coletti to secure third. Debutants Pic and Izawa finished in fifth and sixth places; the latter narrowly held off Trummer on the main straight. Nasr, Binder and Quaife-Hobbs rounded out the top-ten points scoring positions. De Jong, Daly, Abt, Evans and Markelov filled the next five places and Haryanto, Lancaster, Marciello, Richelmi and Negrão completed the top twenty. Cecotto, Rossi and Berthon were the last of the classified finishers.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sprint_race">Sprint race</span></h4>
<p>The second race on 6 April began at 14:15 local time. Weather conditions at the start of the race were hot and sunny with an air temperature of 28 °C (82 °F) and a track temperature at 51 °C (124 °F). All drivers chose to start the event on the hard compound tyres. Vandoorne's access cover above his car's pedals detached itself on an installation lap heading towards turn four which prompted his mechanics to apply tape over it. Tyre preservation was key since temperatures for the sprint race were higher than the previous day's feature event. For the second day running, it was not the pole sitter who led the field entering the first corner as Nasr spun his wheels off the line and Trummer moved into first place and Palmer took over second place. Leal also made a good start, moving from seventh to third, and Quaife-Hobbs settled into fourth position. Coletti stalled on the grid and drivers were forced to swerve to avoid hitting his stationary car. Coletti and Maricello's cars were pushed into the pit lane by mechanics to enable them to be started. Vandoorne made a poor getaway and fell to eleventh. At the beginning of lap two, Trummer was unable to fend off a challenge from Palmer who slipstreamed him on the main straight. Palmer passed Trummer to move into the lead going into the first turn.

He finished second to clinch his first podium result since the 2009 International Formula Master.</div></div></div>
<p>Further down the field that same lap, Vandoorne passed his teammate Izawa but then impacted the rear of de Jong's car at turn four, damaging his front wing and forcing Vandoorne to reduce his speed. Vandoorne was then forced into the sand by the faster Markelov before he could limp back to the pit lane for repairs and dropped out of the top ten. Rossi sustained a puncture on the third lap and was required to make an unscheduled pit stop for soft compound tyres in an attempt to record the race's fastest lap. Since no mandatory pit stops had to be made, Palmer was still leading though his advantage over Trummer was less than a second. Leal was close by despite raising concerns over suspected damage to his car. Evans passed de Jong for eighth place on lap six while Haryanto fell behind Izawa, Daly and Markelow by the eleventh lap. By the race's halfway point, questions were raised about which drivers used their tyres too hard in the early stages of the event and who used their compounds economically with the view for an late attack. The primary action at this point was Abt and Berthon battling for 15th place and both drivers caught Marciello's lapped car. Daly retired on lap 15 after sustaining a possible puncture caused by driving over a turning vane from Binder's vehicle ahead of him.
<a name="text17"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></a></p><p>The first three runners were separated by less than two seconds with six laps left. Palmer and Leal received frequent reminders to preserve their tyres, while Trummer was informed over the radio that to have any hopes of winning the race he had to attack. Quaife-Hobbs slowed because his tyres had degraded enough to enable Nasr to close up to him. Their battle allowed Pic, Richelmi, Evans and Binder to close up causing jostling and minor contact between all six cars. Nasr initially passed Quaife-Hobbs at the final corner on the 30th lap but Quaife-Hobbs reclaimed fourth place driving into the first turn. Nasr finally got ahead of Quaife-Hobbs by slipstreaming him driving on the outside line heading into turn four. On the final lap, Richelmi overtook Pic at turn eight for fifth place while Pic and Markelov lost positions to Evans and Binder. Trummer was unable to overhaul Palmer who kept the lead for the remainder of the race to clinch his fourth victory in the GP2 Series. Trummer finished eight-tenths of a second adrift in second and took his first podium finish since the 2009 International Formula Master. Leal was a further six-tenths of a second in arrears in third, with Nasr fourth and Richelmi fifth. Quaife-Hobbs, Evans and Binder rounded out the top-eight points scoring positions. Pic, Markelov, de Jong, Izawa, Abt, Cecotto, Lancaster, Haryanto, Berthon, Negrão, Sato and Regalia, Vandoorne, Coletti, Marciello and Rossi were the last of the 25 classified finishers.

<p>The top three drivers of both races appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. After the feature race, Vandoorne believed he could have probably run longer with the soft-compound tyres but chose to enter the pit lane to ensure he would retain the lead and felt his team made the correct decision, "We just wanted to be safe and keep the lead because we already had made two more laps than the others on the soft tyres." Leal was delighted to secure a second-place finish and did not believe he could have finished in the position because of where he started but his team noted his pace was strong throughout pre-season testing, "It’s great that we were able to replicate that and get here today. He revealed his engineer told him to push hard for two laps enabling him to gain positions and was not attempting to attack Palmer but passed him as a result of conserving his tyres towards the end of the race. Third-place finisher Palmer spoke of his disappointment because he felt his team could have challenged for the victory but praised the strategy that enabled him to move back up the field. He admitted that work needed done on his starts but did not change his strategy after his slow getaway.
<a name="text19"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></a></p><p>When the sprint race had finished, Palmer stated on the podium, "Yesterday was first to sixth in one lap and now it is sixth to first so it definitely made up for it and I am absolutely delighted. We had done a lot of homework on the start and the tyre degradation and I think we nailed them both. He described the race as "tough" and drove more conservatively with the knowledge he acculated from the previous   day's race and also made set-up and balance changes. Trummer said it felt "really good" to finish in second place and knew beforehand that he would achieve a good result in the sprint race. He stated he did not defend excessively against Palmer on the second lap because of his fast pace and was aware he had to conserve tyre life, "But I was a bit wrong because he kept this strong pace all race long. Even at the end of the race I thought he would struggle more but he didn’t. It was really hard to attack him. That was a great race. I had a great pace and I’m happy with P2." Third-place finisher Leal spoke of an "unbelievable" start of the season for himself and his team but focused their attention to the next race of the season. He said after the first corner, he was maintaining third place and praised Trummer for his performance in spite of not overtaking him in the first three laps.
<a name="text20"><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></a></p><p>Following this, the first race of the season, Palmer led the Drivers' Championship with 38 points, ten ahead of second-placed Leal. Vandoorne was in third on 25 points, with Trummer a further seven points behind in fourth. Nasr rounded out the top five with twelve points. DAMS assumed the lead of the Teams' Championship with 44 points; Carlin was close behind in the battle for first place with 40 points. ART Grand Prix was in third place on 33 points with Rapax ten points in arrears in fourth place. Racing Engineering stood in fifth position on twelve points with ten rounds left in the season.
