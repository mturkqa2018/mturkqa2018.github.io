<p><b>Country music</b>, also known as  <b>country and western</b> (or simply <b>country</b>), and <b>hillbilly music</a></b>, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States</a> in the  early 1920s.<sup id="cite_ref-Peterson_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It takes its roots from genres such as folk music</a> (especially Appalachian folk</a> and Western music</a>) and blues</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Country music often consists a lot of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos</a>, electric and acoustic guitars</a>, steel guitars</a> (such as pedal steels</a> and dobros</a>), and fiddles</a> as well as harmonicas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-dictionary_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-dictionaryoxford_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Blues modes</a> have been used extensively throughout its recorded history</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>According to Lindsey Starnes, the term <i>country music</i> gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term <i>hillbilly</a> music</i>; it came to encompass Western music</a>, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>The term <i>country music</i> is used today to describe many styles</a> and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working class Americans</a>, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Generations">Generations</span></h2>
<p>The first generation emerged in the early 1920s, with Atlanta's music scene</a> playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. New York City record label Okeh Records</a> began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin' John Carson</a> as early as 1923, followed by Columbia Records</a> (series 15000D "Old Familiar Tunes") (Samantha Bumgarner</a>) in 1924, and RCA Victor Records</a> in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre Jimmie Rodgers</a> and the first family of  country music The Carter Family</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-78discography.com_18-0" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Many "hillbilly" musicians, such as Cliff Carlisle</a>, recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.<sup id="cite_ref-Russell_14,_15,_25,_31,_45,_59,_73,_107,_157,_161,_165,_167,_225_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>During the second generation (1930s–1940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and "barn dance" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the <i>Grand Ole Opry</a></i>, aired starting in 1925 by WSM</a> in Nashville</a> and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Bob Wills</a> was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains</a> who had become very popular as the leader of a "hot</a> string band</a>," and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns</a>. His mix of country and jazz</a>, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as Western swing</a>. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.<sup id="cite_ref-Takecountryback.com_20-0" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Country musicians began recording boogie</a> in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall</a>, when Johnny Barfield</a> recorded "Boogie Woogie".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The third generation (1950s–1960s) started at the end of World War II</a> with "mountaineer" string band music known as bluegrass</a>, which emerged when Bill Monroe</a>, along with Lester Flatt</a> and Earl Scruggs</a> were introduced by Roy Acuff</a> at the Grand Ole Opry. Gospel music</a> remained a popular component of country music. Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro</a> or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma</a>. It became known as honky tonk</a>, and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera</a> music of Mexico and the border states. By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly</a> in country music, with Johnny Cash</a> emerging as one of the most popular and enduring representatives of the rockabilly genre; rockabilly was also a starting point for eventual rock-and-roll superstar Elvis Presley</a>, who would return to his country roots near the end of his life. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound</a> turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee</a>; Patsy Cline</a> and Jim Reeves</a> were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion</a>, many desired a return to the "old values" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Fourth generation (1970s–1980s) music included outlaw country</a> with roots in the Bakersfield sound</a>, and country pop</a> with roots in the countrypolitan</a>, folk music and soft rock</a>. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist John Denver</a> released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of "neocountry disco music" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional "back-to-basics" production; this neotraditional movement</a> would dominate country music through the late 1980s and was typified by the likes of George Strait</a>. Attempts to combine punk</a> and country were pioneered by Jason and the Scorchers</a>, and in the 1980s Southern Californian cowpunk</a> scene with bands like the Long Ryders</a> and Mojo Nixon</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>During the fifth generation (1990s), country music became a worldwide phenomenon. Two types of artists enjoyed mainstream popularity: neotraditionalists such as Alan Jackson</a>, and the more broadly popular stadium country</a> acts, in particular Garth Brooks</a>. The Dixie Chicks</a> became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p><p>The sixth generation (2000s–present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. The influence of rock music</a> in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Hip-hop</a> also made its mark on country music with the emergence of country rap</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were in the country pop genre, such as those by Lady Antebellum</a>, Florida Georgia Line</a>, Carrie Underwood</a> and Taylor Swift</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-best-selling_22-0" class="reference">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular singing cowboys</a> from the era were Gene Autry</a>, the Sons of the Pioneers</a>, and Roy Rogers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> Country music and western music were frequently played together on the same radio stations, hence the term <i>country and western</i> music. Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. Patsy Montana</a> opened the door for female artists with her history-making song "I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. Bob Wills</a> was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains</a> who had become very popular as the leader of a "hot</a> string band</a>," and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Changing_instrumentation">Changing instrumentation</span></h3>
<p>Drums were scorned by early country musicians as being "too loud" and "not pure", but by 1935 Western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the Texas Playboys</a>. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry <i>Louisiana Hayride</a></i> kept its infrequently used drummer back stage as late as 1956.

<p>Country musicians began recording boogie</a> in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall</a>, when Johnny Barfield</a> recorded "Boogie Woogie". The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning in late 1945. One notable release from this period was The Delmore Brothers</a>' "Freight Train Boogie", considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly</a>. In 1948, Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith</a> achieved top ten US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of "Guitar Boogie</a>" and "Banjo Boogie", with the former crossing over to the US pop charts.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> Other country boogie artists included Moon Mullican</a>, Merrill Moore</a> and Tennessee Ernie Ford</a>.

<p>Another type of stripped down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro</a> or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma</a>. It became known as honky tonk</a> and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera</a> music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills</a> and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as "a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white&#160;... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey."<sup id="cite_ref-Workin_1999._page_135_49-0" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> East Texan Al Dexter</a> had a hit with "Honky Tonk Blues", and seven years later "Pistol Packin' Mama</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> These "honky tonk" songs associated barrooms, were performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb</a>, Kitty Wells</a> (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan</a>, Floyd Tillman</a>, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose</a>, Lefty Frizzell</a> and Hank Williams</a>, would later be called "traditional" country.

Webb Pierce</a> was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.

<p>By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads and Tejano music</a> rhythms of the southwestern U.S.</a> and northern Mexico, reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song "El Paso</a>", first recorded by Marty Robbins</a> in September 1959. In 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in Lubbock, Texas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-hamilton_52-0" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> The country music scene largely kept the music of the folk revival</a> and folk rock</a> at a distance, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, The Byrds</a>' negative reception during their appearance on the <i>Grand Ole Opry</i>). The main concern was politics: the folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. Only a handful of folk artists, such as Burl Ives</a>, John Denver</a> and Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot</a>, would cross over into country music after the folk revival died out. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and truckers</a> in particular. As country radio became more popular, trucking songs like the 1963 hit song <i>Six Days on the Road</i> by Dave Dudley</a> began to make up their own subgenre of country. These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a "new folk hero", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like "ICC" for Interstate Commerce Commission</a> and "little white pills" as a reference to amphetamines</a>. Starday Records</a> in Nashville followed up on Dudley's initial success with the release of <i>Give me 40 Acres</i> by the Willis Brothers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-hamilton_52-1" class="reference">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly</a> in country music. Rockabilly was an early form of rock and roll</a>, an upbeat combination of blues</a> and country music.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGilliland1969shows_7–8_54-0" class="reference">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> The number two, three and four songs on <i>Billboard's</a></i> charts for that year were Elvis Presley</a>, "Heartbreak Hotel</a>"; Johnny Cash</a>, "I Walk the Line</a>"; and Carl Perkins</a>, "Blue Suede Shoes</a>" Thumper Jones (George Jones)<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 "Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger" by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley "Don't/I Beg of You."<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues</a> artists and his style, saying "The colored folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know." Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>Country music gained national television exposure through <i>Ozark Jubilee</a></i> on ABC-TV and radio from 1955 to 1960 from Springfield, Missouri</a>. The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the Ozarks</a>. As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, "Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else."<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> The late 1950s saw the emergence of Buddy Holly</a>, but by the end of the decade, backlash as well as traditional artists such as Ray Price</a>, Marty Robbins</a>, and Johnny Horton</a> began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Nashville sound</a></div>
<p>Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee</a>. Under the direction of producers such as Chet Atkins</a>, Paul Cohen</a>, Owen Bradley</a>, Bob Ferguson</a>, and later Billy Sherrill</a>, the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup> This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a string section</a> (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark "licks". Leading artists in this genre included Jim Reeves</a>, Skeeter Davis</a>, Connie Smith</a>, The Browns</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGilliland1969shows_10–11_59-0" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> Patsy Cline</a>, and Eddy Arnold</a>. The "slip note" piano style of session musician Floyd Cramer</a> was an important component of this style. The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the British Invasion</a> and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into countrypolitan</a>. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included Tammy Wynette</a>, Lynn Anderson</a> and Charlie Rich</a>, as well as such former "hard country" artists as Ray Price</a> and Marty Robbins</a>. Despite the appeal of the Nashville sound, many traditional country artists emerged during this period and dominated the genre: Loretta Lynn</a>, Merle Haggard</a>, Buck Owens</a>, Porter Wagoner</a>, George Jones, and Sonny James</a> among them.

"After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just stay around Texas, maybe Oklahoma. Waylon and I had that outlaw image going, and when it caught on at colleges and we started selling records, we were O.K.

<p>Country pop or soft pop, with roots in the countrypolitan</a> sound, folk music, and soft rock</a>, is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to adult contemporary music</a>. It started with pop music singers like Glen Campbell</a>, Bobbie Gentry</a>, John Denver</a>, Olivia Newton-John</a>, Anne Murray</a>, B. J. Thomas</a>, The Bellamy Brothers</a>, and Linda Ronstadt</a> having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles ("Rocky Mountain High</a>", "Sunshine on My Shoulders</a>", "Annie's Song</a>", "Thank God I'm a Country Boy</a>", and "I'm Sorry</a>"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the "Best Female Country Vocal Performance" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, "Female Vocalist of the Year". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Jean Shepard</a> and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived "Association of Country Entertainers" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.

Parton's male counterpart, Kenny Rogers</a>, came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with The First Edition</a>, achieving success the same year with "Lucille</a>", which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Artists like Crystal Gayle</a>, Ronnie Milsap</a> and Barbara Mandrell</a> would also find success on the pop charts with their records.

<p>Country rock is a genre that started in the 1960s but became prominent in the 1970s. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion</a>, many desired a return to the "old values" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock</a>. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included Bob Dylan</a>, who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album <i>John Wesley Harding</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGilliland1969show_54_72-0" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> (and even more so with that album's follow-up, <i>Nashville Skyline</a></i>), followed by Gene Clark</a>, Clark's former band The Byrds</a> (with Gram Parsons</a> on <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</a></i>) and its spin-off The Flying Burrito Brothers</a> (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist Clarence White</a>, Michael Nesmith</a> (The Monkees</a> and the First National Band</a>), the Grateful Dead</a>, Neil Young</a>, Commander Cody</a>, The Allman Brothers</a>, The Marshall Tucker Band</a>, Poco</a>, Buffalo Springfield</a>, and Eagles</a>, among many, even the former folk music duo Ian &amp; Sylvia</a>, who formed Great Speckled Bird</a> in 1969. The Eagles would become the most successful of these country rock acts, and their compilation album <i>Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)</a></i> remains the second best-selling album of all time in the US with 29 million copies sold.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> The Rolling Stones</a> also got into the act with songs like "Dead Flowers</a>" and a country version of "Honky Tonk Women</a>".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">38</span></p><p>Described by AllMusic</a> as the "father of country-rock",<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> Gram Parsons' work in the early 1970s was acclaimed for its purity and for his appreciation for aspects of traditional country music.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup> Though his career was cut tragically short by his 1973 death, his legacy was carried on by his protégé and duet partner Emmylou Harris</a>; Harris would release her debut solo in 1975, an amalgamation of country, rock and roll, folk, blues and pop. Subsequent to the initial blending of the two polar opposite genres, other offspring soon resulted, including Southern rock</a>, heartland rock</a> and in more recent years, alternative country</a>. In the decades that followed, artists such as Juice Newton</a>, Alabama</a>, Hank Williams, Jr.</a> (and, to an even greater extent, Hank Williams III</a>), Gary Allan</a>, Shania Twain</a>, Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>, Faith Hill</a>, Garth Brooks</a>, Alan Jackson</a>, Dwight Yoakam</a>, Steve Earle</a>, Dolly Parton</a>, Rosanne Cash</a> and Linda Ronstadt</a> moved country further towards rock influence.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Neotraditionalist country</a></div>
<p>During the mid-1980s, a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts, in favor of more, traditional, "back-to-basics" production. Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included Travis Tritt</a>, Reba McEntire</a>, George Strait</a>, Keith Whitley</a>, Alan Jackson</a>, Ricky Skaggs</a>, Patty Loveless</a>, Kathy Mattea</a>, Randy Travis</a>, Dwight Yoakam</a>, and The Judds</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>Beginning in 1989, a confluence of events brought an unprecedented commercial boom to country music. The arrival of exceptionally talented artists coincided with new marketing strategies to engage fans, technology that more accurately tracked the popularity of country music, and a political and economic climate that focused attention on the genre. Garth Brooks</a> ("Friends in Low Places") in particular attracted fans with his fusion of neotraditionalist country and stadium rock</a>. Other artists such as Brooks and Dunn</a> ("Boot Scootin' Boogie") also combined conventional country with slick, rock elements, while Lorrie Morgan</a>, Mary Chapin Carpenter</a>, and Kathy Mattea</a> updated neotraditionalist styles.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Country music was aided by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission</a>'s (FCC) Docket 80–90, which led to a significant expansion of FM radio</a> in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural AM radio</a> stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by talk radio</a> (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the classic country</a> format for the AM audience). At the same time, beautiful music</a> stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, <i>Billboard</a></i>, which had published a country music chart</a> since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on country radio</a> determined a song's place on the chart.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup>

Toby Keith</a> began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the late 1990s with <i>Pull My Chain</a></i> and its follow-up, <i>Unleashed</a></i>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Success_of_female_artists">Success of female artists</span></h3>
<p>Female artists such as Reba McEntire</a>, Patty Loveless</a>, Faith Hill</a>, Martina McBride</a>, Deana Carter</a>, LeAnn Rimes</a>, Mindy McCready</a>, Lorrie Morgan</a>, Shania Twain</a>, and Mary Chapin Carpenter</a> all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The Dixie Chicks</a> became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album <i>Wide Open Spaces</a></i> went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album <i>Fly</a></i> went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, <i>Home</a></i>, was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer Natalie Maines</a>'s comments disparaging then-President George W. Bush</a> while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the Iraq War</a> a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's <i>Taking the Long Way</a></i>, took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall but largely ignored among country audiences<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="Who else would have bought it except the country audience?

After <i>Taking the Long Way</i>, the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the Court Yard Hounds</a>) before embarking on a reunion tour in 2016.

<p>Shania Twain</a> became the best selling female country artist of the decade. This was primarily due to the success of her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, <i>The Woman in Me</a></i>, which was certified 12x platinum sold over 20 million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's <i>Come On Over</a></i>, which was certified 20x platinum and sold over 40 million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time. 
Unlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled <i>Up!</a></i>, which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical 'honky-tonk</a>' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Line_dancing_revival">Line dancing revival</span></h3>
<p>In the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of line dancing</a>. This influence was so great that Chet Atkins</a> was quoted as saying, "The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing."<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference">&#91;88&#93;</a></sup> By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as Don Williams</a> and George Jones</a> who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.

<p>Country influences combined with Punk rock</a> and alternative rock</a> to forge the "cowpunk</a>" scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as The Long Ryders</a>, Lone Justice</a> and The Beat Farmers</a>, as well as the established punk group X</a>, whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.<sup id="cite_ref-Malone2002_89-0" class="reference">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup> Simultaneously, a generation of diverse country artists outside of California emerged that rejected the perceived cultural and musical conservatism associated with Nashville's mainstream country musicians in favor of more countercultural outlaw country and folk singer-songwriter traditions (e.g. Woody Guthrie</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">49</span></p><p>Artists from outside California who were associated with early alternative country included singer-songwriters such as Lucinda Williams</a>, Lyle Lovett</a> and Steve Earle</a>, the Nashville country rock band Jason and the Scorchers</a> and the British post-punk band The Mekons</a>.

<p>The sixth generation of the country continued the crossover between country and pop music. Richard Marx</a> crossed over with his <i>Days in Avalon</a></i> album, which features five country songs and several singers and musicians. Alison Krauss</a> sang background vocals to Marx's single "Straight from My Heart." Also, Bon Jovi</a> had a hit single, "Who Says You Can't Go Home</a>", with Jennifer Nettles</a> of Sugarland</a>. Kid Rock</a>'s collaboration with Sheryl Crow</a>, "Picture</a>," was a major crossover hit in 2001 and began Kid Rock's transition from hard rock to a country-rock hybrid that would later produce another major crossover hit, 2008's "All Summer Long</a>." (Crow would also cross over into country with her hit "Easy</a>.") Darius Rucker</a>, former frontman for the 1990s pop-rock band Hootie &amp; the Blowfish</a>, began a country solo career in the late 2000s, one that to date has produced three albums and several hits on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100. Singer-songwriter Unknown Hinson</a> became famous for his appearance in the Charlotte</a> television show <i>Wild, Wild, South</i>, after which Hinson started his own band and toured in southern states. Other rock stars who featured a country song on their albums were Don Henley</a> and Poison</a>.

<p>In 2005, country singer Carrie Underwood</a> rose to fame as the winner of the fourth season of <i>American Idol</a></i> and has since become one of the most prominent recording artists of 2006 through 2016, with worldwide sales of more than 65 million records and seven Grammy Awards</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> With her first single, "Inside Your Heaven</a>", Underwood became the only solo country artist to have a #1 hit on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100</a> chart in the 2000–2009 decade and also broke <i>Billboard</i> chart history as the first country music artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Underwood's debut album, <i>Some Hearts</a></i>, became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by <i>Billboard</a></i> as the #1 Country Album of the 2000–2009 decade. She has also become the female country artist with the most number one hits on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Country Songs</a> chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991–present), having 14 No. 1s and breaking her own <i>Guinness Book</a></i> record of ten. In 2007, Underwood won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist</a>, becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards</a>, and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. <i>Time</a></i> has listed Underwood as one of the 100 most influential people in the world</a>.
In 2016, Underwood topped the Country Airplay</a> chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with most number ones on that chart.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p><p>Carrie Underwood</a> was one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s. In addition to Underwood, <i>American Idol</i> launched the careers of Kellie Pickler</a>, Josh Gracin</a>, Bucky Covington</a>, Kristy Lee Cook</a>, Danny Gokey</a>, Lauren Alaina</a> and Scotty McCreery</a> (as well as that of occasional country singer Kelly Clarkson</a>) in the decade, and would continue to launch country careers in the 2010s. The series <i>Nashville Star</a></i>, while not nearly as successful as <i>Idol</i>, did manage to bring Miranda Lambert</a>, Kacey Musgraves</a> and Chris Young</a> to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as Buddy Jewell</a>, Sean Patrick McGraw</a>, and Canadian musician George Canyon</a>. <i>Can You Duet</a>?</i> produced the duos Steel Magnolia</a> and Joey + Rory</a>. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress Jennette McCurdy</a> (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom <i>iCarly</a></i>) released her first single, "So Close", following that with the single "Generation Love</a>" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, Miley Cyrus</a> (of <i>Hannah Montana</a></i>), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with "The Climb</a>" and another with a duet with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, with "Ready, Set, Don't Go</a>." Jana Kramer</a>, an actress in the teen drama <i>One Tree Hill</a></i>, released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013. Actresses Hayden Panettiere</a> and Connie Britton</a> began recording country songs as part of her role in the TV series <i>Nashville</a></i>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">57</span></p><p>In 2010, the group Lady Antebellum</a> won five Grammys, including the coveted Song of the Year</a> and Record of the Year</a> for "Need You Now</a>, a UK number 15 hit on the mainstream singles chart, a rarity for a country song these days ".<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup> A large number of duos and vocal groups emerged on the charts in the 2010s, many of which feature close harmony</a> in the lead vocals. In addition to Lady Antebellum, groups such as Herrick</a>, The Quebe Sisters Band</a>, Little Big Town</a>, The Band Perry</a>, Gloriana</a>, Thompson Square</a>, Eli Young Band</a>, Zac Brown Band</a> and British duo The Shires</a> have emerged to occupy a large portion of the new country artists in the popular scene along with solo singers Kacey Musgraves</a> and Miranda Lambert</a>.

<p>One of the most commercially successful country artists of the late 2000s and early 2010s has been singer-songwriter Taylor Swift</a>. Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, "Tim McGraw</a>," was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Taylor released her first studio album, <i>Taylor Swift</a></i>, which spent 275 weeks on Billboard 200, one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, <i>Fearless</a></i>, which made her the second-longest Number One charted on Billboard 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind Adele</a>'s <i>21</a></i>) within the past 5 years. At the 2010 Grammys, Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for <i>Fearless</i>, which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten Grammys already. Buoyed by her teen idol</a> status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the <i>Billboard</a></i> charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</a>" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot Country Songs</a> chart of any song in nearly five decades.  The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as "Shake It Off</a>," were released solely to pop audiences.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference">&#91;98&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>The September 11 attacks</a> of 2001 and the economic recession helped move country music back into the spotlight. Many country artists, such as Alan Jackson with his ballad on terrorist attacks, "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)</a>", wrote songs that celebrated the military, highlighted the gospel, and emphasized home and family values over wealth. Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song "New York, New York</a>" pays tribute to New York City, and its popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing in front of the Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city. In contrast, more rock-oriented country singers took more direct aim at the attacks' perpetrators; Toby Keith's "The Angry American (Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue)</a>" threatened to "a boot in" the posterior of the enemy, while Charlie Daniels's "This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag</a>" promised to "hunt" the perpetrators "down like a mad dog hound." These songs gained such recognition that it put country music back into popular culture.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> The influence of rock music</a> in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s as artists like Eric Church</a>, Jason Aldean</a>, and Brantley Gilbert</a> have had success; Aaron Lewis</a>, former frontman for the rock group Staind</a>, had a moderately successful entry into country music in 2011 and 2012. Also rising in the late 2000s and early 2010s was the insertion of rap</a> and spoken-word elements into country songs; artists such as Cowboy Troy</a> and Colt Ford</a> have focused almost exclusively on country rap</a> (also known as hick hop) while other, more mainstream artists (such as Big &amp; Rich</a> and Jason Aldean) have used it on occasion.

<p>Outside of the United States, Canada has the largest country music fan and artist base, something that is to be expected given the two countries' proximity and cultural parallels. Mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the prairie provinces</a>, the British Columbia Interior</a>, Ontario, and in Atlantic Canada</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-book_109-0" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> Celtic traditional music</a> developed in Atlantic Canada in the form of Scottish, Acadian and Irish folk music popular amongst Irish, French and Scottish immigrants to Canada's Atlantic Provinces (Newfoundland</a>, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick</a>, and Prince Edward Island</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-book_109-1" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> Like the southern United States and Appalachia</a>, all four regions are of heavy British Isles</a> stock and rural; as such, the development of traditional music in the Maritimes somewhat mirrored the development of country music in the US South and Appalachia. Country and Western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or "sea shanty</a>" in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred. Certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly. For example, in Newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and Irish</a> in nature, whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">63</span></p><p><i>Don Messer's Jubilee</a></i> was a Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>-based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. In Canada it out-performed <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i> broadcast from the United States and became the top-rated television show throughout much of the 1960s. <i>Don Messer's Jubilee</i> followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named "Goin' to the Barndance Tonight", followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his "Islanders" including singers Marg Osburne</a> and Charlie Chamberlain</a>, the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with "Till We Meet Again</a>".
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p><p>The guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including Stompin' Tom Connors</a> and Catherine McKinnon</a>. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. Hank Snow</a>, Wilf Carter</a> (also known as Montana Slim), and Anne Murray</a> are the three most notable.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><p>The cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Parliament of Canada.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">66</span></p><p>The Prairie provinces, due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music.<sup id="cite_ref-book_109-2" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> While the Prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of Scottish</a>, Ukrainian</a>, German</a> and others. For these reasons polkas</a> and Western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the folk</a> or Celtic</a> genres.<sup id="cite_ref-book_109-3" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">67</span></p><p>Many traditional country artists are present in eastern and western Canada. They make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles. Some notable Canadian country artists include Shania Twain</a>, Anne Murray</a>, k.d. lang</a>, Gordon Lightfoot</a>, Buffy Sainte-Marie</a>, George Canyon</a>, Blue Rodeo</a>, Tommy Hunter</a>, Rita MacNeil</a>, Stompin' Tom Connors</a>, Stan Rogers</a>, Ronnie Prophet</a>, Carroll Baker</a>, The Rankin Family</a>, Ian Tyson</a>, Johnny Reid</a>, Paul Brandt</a>, Jason McCoy</a>, George Fox</a>, Carolyn Dawn Johnson</a>, Hank Snow</a>, Don Messer</a>, Wilf Carter</a>, Michelle Wright</a>, Terri Clark</a>, Prairie Oyster</a>, Family Brown</a>, Johnny Mooring</a>, Marg Osburne</a>, Lindsay Ell</a>, Doc Walker</a>, Emerson Drive</a>, The Wilkinsons</a>, Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans</a>, Crystal Shawanda</a>, Dean Brody</a>, Shane Yellowbird</a>, Gord Bamford</a>, Chad Brownlee</a>, The Road Hammers</a>, Rowdy Spurs, Colter Wall</a> and The Higgins</a>.

<p>Australian country music</a> has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian bush balladeers</a> like Henry Lawson</a> and Banjo Paterson</a>. Country instruments, including the guitar, banjo</a>, fiddle</a> and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">69</span></p><p>Folk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government tyranny</a>, or the lives of bushrangers</a>, swagmen</a>, drovers</a>, stockmen</a> and shearers</a>, continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as "bush music" or "bush band</a> music". "Waltzing Matilda</a>", often regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem</a>, is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include "The Wild Colonial Boy</a>", "Click Go the Shears</a>", "The Queensland Drover" and "The Dying Stockman". Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of Aboriginality</a> and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference">&#91;110&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference">&#91;111&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">70</span></p><p>Pioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included Tex Morton</a> (known as "The Father of Australian Country Music") in the 1930s. Author Andrew Smith delivers a through research and engaged view of Tex Morton's life and his impact on the country music scene in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Other early stars included Buddy Williams</a>, Shirley Thoms</a> and Smoky Dawson</a>. Buddy Williams (1918–1986) was the first Australian-born to record country music in Australia in the late 1930s and was the pioneer of a distinctly Australian style of country music called the bush ballad that others such as Slim Dusty would make popular in later years. During the Second World War, many of Buddy Williams recording sessions were done whilst on leave from the Army. At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">71</span></p><p>In 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. Slim Dusty</a> (1927–2003) was known as the "King of Australian Country Music" and helped to popularise the Australian bush ballad</a>. His successful career spanned almost six decades, and his 1957 hit "A Pub with No Beer</a>" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian-obit_112-0" class="reference">&#91;112&#93;</a></sup> Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing "Waltzing Matilda</a>" in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games</a>. Dusty's wife Joy McKean</a> penned several of his most popular songs.

<p>Chad Morgan</a>, who began recording in the 1950s, has represented a vaudeville</a> style of comic Australian country; Frank Ifield</a> achieved considerable success in the early 1960s, especially in the UK Singles Charts and Reg Lindsay</a> was one of the first Australians to perform at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry</a> in 1974.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup> Eric Bogle</a>'s 1972 folk lament to the Gallipoli Campaign</a> "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda</a>" recalled the British and Irish origins of Australian folk-country.

<p>By the 1990s, country music had attained crossover success in the pop charts, with artists like James Blundell</a> and James Reyne</a> singing "Way Out West</a>", and country star Kasey Chambers</a> winning the ARIA</a> for Best Female Artist in 2003. The crossover influence of Australian country is also evident in the music of successful contemporary bands the Waifs</a> and the John Butler Trio</a>. Nick Cave</a> has been heavily influenced by the country artist Johnny Cash</a>. In 2000, Cash, covered Cave's "The Mercy Seat</a>" on the album <i>American III: Solitary Man</a></i>, seemingly repaying Cave for the compliment he paid by covering Cash's "The Singer" (originally "The Folk Singer</a>") on his <i>Kicking Against the Pricks</a></i> album. Subsequently, Cave cut a duet with Cash on a version of Hank Williams</a>' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry</a>" for Cash's <i>American IV: The Man Comes Around</a></i> album (2002).<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Country music has enjoyed mainstream exposure and success throughout the '60s and '70s in the United Kingdom. However, this  somewhat diminished in the '90s and 2000s. Though, there have been exceptions such as Garth Brooks</a> and Shania Twain</a> in the '90s (particularly the latter) and Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood</a>, Lady Antebellum</a> and the Dixie Chicks in the 2000s. Crossover hits (in terms of singles and albums) within the country genre are few and far between and have been since the '80s. There are some British country music</a> acts and publications. Although radio stations devoted to country are among the most popular in other Anglophone nations, none of the top 10 most-listened-to stations in the UK</a> are country stations, and national broadcaster BBC Radio</a> does not offer a full-time country station (BBC Radio 2 Country</a>, a "pop-up" station, operated four days each year between 2015 and 2017). The BBC does offer a country show on BBC Radio 2</a> each week hosted by Bob Harris</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference">&#91;117&#93;</a></sup>  UK Country music is overseen by the British Country Music Association</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">79</span></p><p>The most successful British country music act of the 21st century are Ward Thomas</a> and the Shires</a>. In 2015, the Shires' album <i>Brave</a></i>, became the first UK country act ever to chart in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart</a> and they became the first UK country act to receive an award from the American Country Music Association</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup> In 2016, Ward Thomas</a> then became the first UK country act to hit number 1 in the UK Albums Chart</a> with their album <i>Cartwheels</i></a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">80</span></p><p>There is the C2C: Country to Country</a> festival held every year, and for many years there was a festival at Wembley Arena</a>, which was broadcast on the BBC</a>, the International Festivals of Country Music, promoted by Mervyn Conn</a>, held at the venue between 1969 and 1991. The shows were later taken into Europe, and featured such stars as Johnny Cash</a>, Dolly Parton</a>, Tammy Wynette</a>, David Allan Coe</a>, Emmylou Harris</a>, Boxcar Willie</a>, Johnny Russell</a> and Jerry Lee Lewis</a>. A handful of country musicians had even greater success in mainstream UK music than they did in the US, despite a certain amount of disdain from the music press. The UK's largest music festival Glastonbury</a> has featured major US country acts in recent years, such as Kenny Rogers</a> in 2013 and Dolly Parton in 2014.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">81</span></p><p>From within the UK, few country musicians achieved widespread mainstream success. Tom Jones</a>, by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bee Gees</a> had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists ("Rest Your Love on Me</a>") and a major hit as songwriters ("Islands in the Stream</a>"); Barry Gibb</a>, the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style.<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup> Singer Engelbert Humperdinck</a>, while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with "After the Lovin'</a>," achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his faithful covers of Nashville country ballads such as "Release Me</a>," "Am I That Easy to Forget</a>" and "There Goes My Everything</a>." The songwriting tandem of Roger Cook</a> and Roger Greenaway</a> wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame</a>. Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler</a> initially started her career making country albums and was even nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards</a> before her huge crossover hit "Total Eclipse of the Heart</a>" lead her towards more commercial pop and rock. In 2013, Tyler returned to her roots, blending the country elements of her early work with the rock of her successful material on her album <i>Rocks and Honey</a></i> which featured a duet with American country icon Vince Gill</a>. Tyler subsequently announced that she was making a new country rock album in Nashville with John Carter Cash</a>, son of country music legends Johnny Cash</a> and June Carter Cash</a>, slated for release in 2018.

<p>Six U.S. cable TV networks are at least partly devoted to the genre: Country Music Television</a> and CMT Music</a> (both owned by Viacom</a>), Rural Free Delivery TV</a> (owned by Rural Media Group), Great American Country</a> (owned by Scripps Networks</a>), Heartland</a> (owned by Luken Communications</a>), and The Country Network</a> (owned by TCN Country, LLC).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">91</span></p><p>The first American country music video cable channel was The Nashville Network</a>, launched in the early 1980s as a channel devoted to southern culture. In 2000, after it and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, the channel was stripped of its country format and rebranded as <i>The National Network</i>, then <i>Spike</i>, and finally Paramount Network</a>. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts Crook &amp; Chase</a>) acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.

<p>Only one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: CMT</a> owned by Corus Entertainment</a> (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, Cancom</a>-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day Cottage Life</a> network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold. Stingray Music</a> continues to maintain several country music audio-only channels on cable radio</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">93</span></p><p>In the past, country music had an extensive presence, especially on the Canadian national broadcaster, CBC Television</a>.
