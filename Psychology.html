<p><b>Psychology</b> is the science</a> of behavior</a> and mind</a>, including conscious</a> and unconscious</a> phenomena, as well as feeling</a> and thought</a>. It is an academic discipline</a> of immense scope and diverse interests that, when taken together, seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains</a>, and all the variety of epiphenomena</a> they manifest. As a social science</a> it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<sup id="cite_ref-Fernald_1-0" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Psychology_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>In this field, a professional practitioner</a> or researcher is called a psychologist</a> and can be classified as a social</a>, behavioral</a>, or cognitive scientist</a>. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions</a> in individual and social behavior</a>, while also exploring the physiological</a> and biological</a> processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception</a>, cognition</a>, attention</a>, emotion</a> (affect</a>), intelligence</a>, phenomenology</a>, motivation</a> (conation</a>), brain functioning</a>, and personality</a>. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships</a>, including psychological resilience</a>, family resilience</a>, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-reference_name_A_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Psychologists employ empirical methods</a> to infer causal</a> and correlational</a> relationships between psychosocial variables</a>. In addition</a>, or in opposition</a>, to employing empirical</a> and deductive</a> methods, some—especially clinical</a> and counseling</a> psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation</a> and other inductive</a> techniques. Psychology has been described as a "hub science" in that medicine</a> tends to draw psychological research via neurology</a> and psychiatry</a>, whereas social sciences most commonly draws directly from sub-disciplines within psychology.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment</a> and treatment</a> of mental health</a> problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity</a>. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.<sup id="cite_ref-O&#39;Neil_5-0" class="reference">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-APA_mission_6-0" class="reference">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical</a>, counseling</a>, or school</a> settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational</a> settings, or in other areas<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> such as human development and aging</a>, sports</a>, health</a>, and the media</a>, as well as in forensic</a> investigation and other aspects of law</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology_and_definitions">Etymology and definitions</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>psychology</a></i> derives from Greek roots meaning study of the psyche</a>, or soul</a> (ψυχή</a> <i>psychē</i>, "breath, spirit, soul" and -λογία <i>-logia</i></a>, "study of" or "research").<sup id="cite_ref-OED_8-0" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The Latin</a> word <i>psychologia</i> was first used by the Croatian</a> humanist</a> and Latinist</a> Marko Marulić</a> in his book, <i>Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae</i> in the late 15th century or early 16th century.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> The earliest known reference to the word <i>psychology</i> in English was by Steven Blankaart</a> in 1694 in <i>The Physical Dictionary</i> which refers to "Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul."<sup id="cite_ref-OED_Psychology_10-0" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>In 1890, William James</a> defined <i>psychology</i> as "the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions". This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John B. Watson</a>, who in his 1913 manifesto defined the discipline of psychology as the acquisition of information useful to the control of behavior.

<p>The ancient civilizations of Egypt</a>, Greece</a>, China</a>, India</a>, and Persia</a> all engaged in the philosophical</a> study of psychology. Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales</a>, Plato</a>, and Aristotle</a> (especially in his <i>De Anima</a></i> treatise),<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> addressed the workings of the mind.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> As early as the 4th century BC, Greek physician Hippocrates</a> theorized that mental disorders</a> had physical rather than supernatural causes.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>In China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of Laozi</a> and Confucius</a>, and later from the doctrines of Buddhism. This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as <i>The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine</a></i> identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin–yang</a> balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the Qing Dynasty</a> with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), Liu Zhi (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization</a> in brain function.<sup id="cite_ref-HsuehGuo_17-0" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>Distinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by Hinduism</a>. A central idea of the Upanishads</a> is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their eternal unchanging soul</a>. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism</a>, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. Yoga</a> is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the Sanskrit corpus was suppressed under the British East India Company</a> followed by the British Raj</a> in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the Theosophical Society</a>, a New Age group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<sup id="cite_ref-Paranjpe_18-0" class="reference">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>Psychology was a popular topic in Enlightenment</a> Europe. In Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum—most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. Christian Wolff</a> identified psychology as its own science, writing <i>Psychologia empirica</i> in 1732 and <i>Psychologia rationalis</i> in 1734. This notion advanced further under Immanuel Kant</a>, who established the idea of anthropology</a>, with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of experimental psychology, writing that "the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object." Having consulted philosophers Hegel</a> and Herbart</a>, in 1825 the Prussian</a> state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system</a>. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.<sup id="cite_ref-Horst_19-0" class="reference">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> In England, early psychology involved phrenology</a> and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country's well-populated mental asylums.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>

<p>One of the earliest psychology societies was <i>La Société de Psychologie Physiologique</i> in France, which lasted 1885–1893. The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology</a> took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst the World's Fair</a> celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James was one of three Americans among the four hundred attendees. The American Psychological Association</a> was founded soon after, in 1892. The International Congress continued to be held, at different locations in Europe, with wider international participation. The Sixth Congress, Geneva 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as Esperanto</a>. After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the American Psychological Association<sup id="cite_ref-BenjaminBaker_23-1" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing the new psychology to the East, and from Japan these ideas diffused into China.<sup id="cite_ref-HsuehGuo_17-1" class="reference">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Takasuna_24-1" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>American psychology gained status during World War I, during which a standing committee headed by Robert Yerkes</a> administered mental tests ("Army Alpha</a>" and "Army Beta</a>") to almost 1.8 million GIs.<sup id="cite_ref-Tomes2008_34-0" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Subsequent funding</a> for behavioral research came in large part from the Rockefeller family</a>, via the Social Science Research Council</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> Rockefeller charities funded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene, which promoted the concept of mental illness and lobbied for psychological supervision of child development.<sup id="cite_ref-Tomes2008_34-1" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Through the Bureau of Social Hygiene and later funding of Alfred Kinsey</a>, Rockefeller foundations established sex research</a> as a viable discipline in the U.S.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> Under the influence of the Carnegie-funded Eugenics Record Office</a>, the Draper-funded Pioneer Fund</a>, and other institutions, the eugenics movement</a> also had a significant impact on American psychology; in the 1910s and 1920s, eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes.<sup id="cite_ref-GuthrieChapter4_39-0" class="reference">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>

University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939–1941, and "the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-propaganda policy for the United States Government."

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>After the Russian Revolution, psychology was heavily promoted by the Bolsheviks</a> as a way to engineer the "New Man" of socialism.

Chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning, with the aspiration that education would enable modernization and nationalization. John Dewey, who lectured to Chinese audiences in 1918–1920, had a significant influence on this doctrine. Chancellor T'sai Yuan-p'ei</a> introduced him at Peking University</a> as a greater thinker than Confucius.

Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin's model of a "reflective" consciousness, envisioning an "active consciousness" (<i>tzu-chueh neng-tung-li</i>) able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle. They developed a concept of "recognition" (<i>jen-shih</i>) which referred the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview. (Failure to correspond with party doctrine was "incorrect recognition".)<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> Psychology education was centralized under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by the State Council.

<p>Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology</a>, which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed great popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James), and indeed constituted the bulk of what people called "psychology". Parapsychology, hypnotism</a>, and psychism</a> were major topics of the early International Congresses. But students of these fields were eventually ostractized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905.<sup id="cite_ref-BenjaminBaker_23-5" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University, with publications such as <i>Clairvoyance and Thoughtography</i> by Tomokichi Fukurai, but here too it was mostly shunned by 1913.<sup id="cite_ref-Takasuna_24-2" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>As a discipline, psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a "soft" science. Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn</a>'s 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking the agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry</a> and physics</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup> Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and questionnaires</a>, critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science. Skeptics have suggested that personality</a>, thinking</a>, and emotion</a>, cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self-reports, which may be problematic. Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities.<sup id="cite_ref-Beveridge_subj_61-0" class="reference">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Peterson_subj_62-0" class="reference">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Panksepp_AN_63-0" class="reference">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>Divisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population. Critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a "cult of empiricism" which limits the scope of its study by using only methods derived from the physical sciences.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> Feminist critiques along these lines have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically mostly male)<sup id="cite_ref-Tomes2008_34-2" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> researchers. Jean Grimshaw, for example, argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal</a> agenda through its efforts to control behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Psychologists generally consider the organism the basis of the mind, and therefore a vitally related area of study. Psychiatrists</a> and neuropsychologists work at the interface of mind and body.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup>
Biological psychology, also known as physiological psychology,<sup id="cite_ref-ThompsonZola_67-0" class="reference">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup> or neuropsychology is the study of the biological substrates of behavior and mental processes. Key research topics in this field include comparative psychology</a>, which studies humans in relation to other animals, and perception</a> which involves the physical mechanics of sensation as well as neural and mental processing.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup> For centuries, a leading question in biological psychology has been whether and how mental functions might be localized in the brain</a>. From Phineas Gage</a> to H. M.</a> and Clive Wearing</a>, individual people with mental issues traceable to physical damage</a> have inspired new discoveries in this area.<sup id="cite_ref-ThompsonZola_67-1" class="reference">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup> Modern neuropsychology could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca</a> traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. Soon after, Carl Wernicke</a> identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">31</span></p><p>The contemporary field of behavioral neuroscience</a> focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior. For example, physiological psychologists</a> use animal models, typically rats, to study the neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> Cognitive neuroscientists</a> investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and neuropsychologists</a> conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease. The biopsychosocial model</a> is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. It assumes that any given behavior or mental process affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">32</span></p><p>Evolutionary psychology</a> examines cognition and personality traits from an evolutionary</a> perspective. This perspective suggests that psychological adaptations</a> evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Evolutionary psychology offers complementary explanations for the mostly proximate or developmental explanations developed by other areas of psychology: that is, it focuses mostly on ultimate or "why?" questions, rather than proximate or "how?" questions. "How?" questions are more directly tackled by behavioral genetics</a> research, which aims to understand how genes and environment</a> impact behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-Behavior_Genetics_72-0" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">33</span></p><p>The search for biological origins of psychological phenomena has long involved debates about the importance of race</a>, and especially the relationship between race and intelligence</a>. The idea of white supremacy</a> and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by Europeans.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> Carl von Linnaeus</a>'s four-fold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent and severe, Americans as contented and free, Asians as ritualistic, and Africans as lazy and capricious. Race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as <i>drapetomania</a></i> and <i>dysaesthesia aethiopica</a></i>—the behavior of uncooperative African slaves.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> After the creation of experimental psychology, "ethnical psychology" emerged as a subdiscipline, based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Cognitive psychology studies cognition</a>, the mental processes</a> underlying mental activity. Perception</a>, attention</a>, reasoning</a>, thinking</a>, problem solving</a>, memory</a>, learning</a>, language</a>, and emotion</a> are areas of research. Classical cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as cognitivism</a>, whose adherents argue for an information processing</a> model of mental function, informed by functionalism</a> and experimental psychology</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>On a broader level, cognitive science</a> is an interdisciplinary enterprise of cognitive psychologists</a>, cognitive neuroscientists</a>, researchers in artificial intelligence</a>, linguists</a>, human–computer interaction</a>, computational neuroscience</a>, logicians</a> and social scientists</a>. Computer simulations</a> are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.

<p>Starting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by Wundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist—concerned with information</a> and its processing</a>—and, eventually, constituted a part of the wider cognitive science</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Mandler_89-0" class="reference">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup> Some called this development the cognitive revolution</a> because it rejected the anti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.<sup id="cite_ref-Mandler_89-1" class="reference">&#91;89&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Social psychology is the study of how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. conformity</a>, persuasion</a>), and the formation of beliefs, attitudes</a>, and stereotypes</a> about other people. Social cognition</a> fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of group dynamics</a> reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the microsocial</a> level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in implicit</a> measures, mediational</a> models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role</a>, sick role</a>, social class</a>, life event, culture</a>, migration</a>, social</a>, and total institution</a>.

<p>Psychoanalysis</a> comprises a method of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially conflict originating in the unconscious mind</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup> This school of thought originated in the 1890s with Austrian medical doctors including Josef Breuer</a> (physician), Alfred Adler</a> (physician), Otto Rank</a> (psychoanalyst), and most prominently Sigmund Freud</a> (neurologist). Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection</a> and clinical observations. It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality</a>, repression</a>, and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society.<sup id="cite_ref-Kozulin1984Pages84to86_49-1" class="reference">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of free association</a> and a therapeutic interest in dream interpretation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference">&#91;93&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">51</span></p><p>Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung</a>, influenced by Freud, elaborated a theory of the collective unconscious</a>—a primordial force present in all humans, featuring archetypes</a> which exerted a profound influence on the mind. Jung's competing vision formed the basis for analytical psychology</a>, which later led to the archetypal</a> and process-oriented</a> schools. Other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century include Erik Erikson</a>, Melanie Klein</a>, D. W. Winnicott</a>, Karen Horney</a>, Erich Fromm</a>, John Bowlby</a>, and Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna Freud</a>. Throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought which could be called Neo-Freudian</a>. Among these schools are ego psychology</a>, object relations</a>, and interpersonal</a>, Lacanian</a>, and relational psychoanalysis</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">52</span></p><p>Psychologists such as Hans Eysenck</a> and philosophers including Karl Popper</a> criticized psychoanalysis. Popper argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline,<sup id="cite_ref-Popper_95-0" class="reference">&#91;95&#93;</a></sup> whereas Eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental</a> data. By the end of 20th century, psychology departments in American universities</a> mostly marginalized Freudian theory, dismissing it as a "desiccated and dead" historical artifact.<sup id="cite_ref-Cohen_96-0" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup> However, researchers in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis</a> today defend some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds,<sup id="cite_ref-reference_name_C_97-0" class="reference">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> while scholars of the humanities</a> maintain that Freud was not a "scientist at all, but ... an interpreter</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-Cohen_96-1" class="reference">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup>

It stands for respect for the worth of persons, respect for differences of approach, open-mindedness as to acceptable methods, and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior. As a "third force" in contemporary psychology, it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems: e.g., love, creativity, self, growth, organism, basic need-gratification, self-actualization, higher values, being, becoming, spontaneity, play, humor, affection, naturalness, warmth, ego-transcendence, objectivity, autonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play, transcendental experience, peak experience, courage, and related concepts.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup><span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">56</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, influenced by philosophers Søren Kierkegaard</a> and Martin Heidegger</a> and, psychoanalytically trained American psychologist Rollo May</a> pioneered an existential</a> branch of psychology, which included existential psychotherapy</a>: a method based on the belief that inner conflict within a person is due to that individual's confrontation with the givens of existence.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h3>
<p>Personality psychology</a> is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion—commonly referred to as personality</a>—in individuals. Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. They carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id, ego, and super-ego</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference">&#91;107&#93;</a></sup> In order to develop a taxonomy of personality constructs, trait theorists</a>, in contrast, attempt to describe the personality sphere in terms of a discrete number of key traits using the statistical data-reduction method of factor analysis</a>. Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, an early biologically-based model proposed by Hans Eysenck</a>, the 3rd mostly highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century (after Freud, and Piaget respectively), suggested that at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality structure: extraversion–introversion</a>, neuroticism</a>-stability, and psychoticism</a>-normality. Raymond Cattell</a>, the 7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century (based on the scientific peer-reviewed journal literature)<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference">&#91;108&#93;</a></sup> empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors</a> at the primary-factor level, and up to 8 broader second-stratum factors (at the Eysenckian level of analysis), rather than the "Big Five" dimensions.<sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference">&#91;110&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference">&#91;111&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference">&#91;112&#93;</a></sup> Dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the DSM-V</a>. However, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the "Big Five" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, whereby it is acknowledged that personality constructs are subject to learning and change across the lifespan.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">59</span></p><p>An early example of personality assessment was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet</a>, constructed during World War I. The popular, although psychometrically inadequate Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</a><sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference">&#91;115&#93;</a></sup> sought to assess individuals' "personality types" according to the personality theories of Carl Jung</a>. Behaviorist resistance to introspection led to the development of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank</a> and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory</a> (MMPI), in an attempt to ask empirical questions that focused less on the psychodynamics of the respondent.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference">&#91;116&#93;</a></sup> However, the MMPI has been subjected to critical scrutiny, given that it adhered to archaic psychiatric nosology, and since it required individuals to provide subjective, introspective responses to the hundreds of items pertaining to psychopathology.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference">&#91;117&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">60</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unconscious_mind">Unconscious mind</span></h3>
<p>Study of the unconscious mind</a>, a part of the psyche outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C. S. Peirce</a> and Joseph Jastrow</a> found in 1884 that subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup> Freud popularized this concept, with terms like Freudian slip</a> entering popular culture, to mean an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech and action. His 1901 text <i>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life</a></i> catalogues hundreds of everyday events which Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. Pierre Janet</a> advanced the idea of a subconscious</a> mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.<sup id="cite_ref-Kihlstrom1999_119-0" class="reference">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">61</span></p><p>Behaviorism notwithstanding, the unconscious mind has maintained its importance in psychology. Cognitive psychologists have used a "filter" model of attention</a>, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious <i>priming</a></i> of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-Kihlstrom1999_119-1" class="reference">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between <i>implicit</a></i> and <i>explicit</a></i> memory. In another approach, one can also describe a subliminal stimulus</a> as meeting an <i>objective</i> but not a <i>subjective</i> threshold.<sup id="cite_ref-BanksFarber_120-0" class="reference">&#91;120&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">62</span></p><p>The automaticity</a> model, which became widespread following exposition by John Bargh</a> and others in the 1980s, describes sophisticated processes for executing goals which can be selected and performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness.<sup id="cite_ref-Barghs_121-0" class="reference">&#91;121&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-KihlstromJuggernaut_122-0" class="reference">&#91;122&#93;</a></sup> Some experimental data suggests that the brain begins to consider taking actions</a> before the mind becomes aware of them.<sup id="cite_ref-BanksFarber_120-1" class="reference">&#91;120&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference">&#91;123&#93;</a></sup> This influence of unconscious forces on people's choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Motivation">Motivation</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Motivation</a></div>
<p>Psychologists such as William James initially used the term <i>motivation</i> to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of <i>will</a></i> in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct</a> also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<sup id="cite_ref-ForgasEtAl_125-0" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup> According to drive theory</a>, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle</a> and the reality principle</a>, roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in <i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</a></i>, Freud introduced the concept of the <i>death drive</a></i>, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<sup id="cite_ref-ForgasEtAl_125-1" class="reference">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-GodsilEtAl_127-0" class="reference">&#91;127&#93;</a></sup> Clark Hull</a> formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction</a> model.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference">&#91;128&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">64</span></p><p>Hunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation all seem to constitute fundamental motivations for animals.<sup id="cite_ref-GodsilEtAl_127-1" class="reference">&#91;127&#93;</a></sup> Humans also seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations—though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from primordial instincts—including desires for belonging, self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference">&#91;129&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference">&#91;130&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">65</span></p><p>Motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that eating</a>, for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for homeostasis</a>—an important factor causing the experience of hunger</a>—but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.<sup id="cite_ref-GodsilEtAl_127-2" class="reference">&#91;127&#93;</a></sup> Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as <i>goal contagion</i>: the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup> Vohs and Baumeister</a> suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfilment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations sometimes obey a "getting begets wanting" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs, or money, the more you want it. They suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep.<sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference">&#91;132&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology</a> seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral</a>, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging</a> and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence</a> and old age</a>). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Genes_and_environment">Genes and environment</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: Behavioral genetics</a></div>
<p>All researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes</a> and environment, to varying degrees.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference">&#91;133&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference">&#91;134&#93;</a></sup> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression</a> from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes</a>. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded</a>. Experimental and quasi-experimental</a> behavioral genetic</a> research uses genetic</a> methodologies to disentangle this confound</a> and understand the nature and origins of individual differences</a> in behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-Behavior_Genetics_72-1" class="reference">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies</a> and adoption studies</a>, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray</a> molecular genetic</a> or genome sequencing</a> technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA</a> variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes</a> are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology</a> through methods including genome-wide association studies</a>. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning</a> and its success in Huntington's</a>: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference">&#91;135&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference">&#91;136&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference">&#91;137&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference">&#91;138&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference">&#91;139&#93;</a></sup> where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder.

Binet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age</a> and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as <i>idiots</a></i>. Henry H. Goddard</a> put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as <i>imbecile</a></i> and <i>feebleminded</a></i>. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor Lewis M.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mental_health_care">Mental health care</span></h3>
<p>The provision of psychological health services is generally called <i>clinical psychology</a></i> in the U.S. The definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology</a> and counseling psychology</a>. Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of <i>professional psychology</a></i>. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<sup id="cite_ref-HallHurley_59-1" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<sup id="cite_ref-StrickerWidiger_150-0" class="reference">&#91;150&#93;</a></sup> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or mental illness</a> and to promote subjective well-being</a> and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<sup id="cite_ref-brain_151-0" class="reference">&#91;151&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">74</span></p><p>Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer</a>, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-StrickerWidiger_150-1" class="reference">&#91;150&#93;</a></sup> For the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy</a> to understand and treat the mentally ill.<sup id="cite_ref-Tomes2008_34-3" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is transference</a>, in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference">&#91;152&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">75</span></p><p>Psychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities</a> and behavioral therapy</a>, a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, cognitive-behavior therapy</a> arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference">&#91;153&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">76</span></p><p>Mental health care today involves psychologists and social workers</a> in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director Bertram Brown</a> described this shift as a source of "intense competition and role confusion".<sup id="cite_ref-Tomes2008_34-4" class="reference">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<sup id="cite_ref-HallHurley_59-2" class="reference">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">77</span></p><p>Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury</a>—this area is known as clinical neuropsychology</a>. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession</a>. The emerging field of <i>disaster psychology</i> (see crisis intervention</a>) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference">&#91;154&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">78</span></p><p>The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic</a>, cognitive behavioral</a>, existential–humanistic</a>, and systems or family therapy</a>. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference">&#91;155&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference">&#91;156&#93;</a></sup> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-157" class="reference">&#91;157&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-158" class="reference">&#91;158&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference">&#91;159&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference">&#91;160&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference">&#91;161&#93;</a></sup>

<p>A true experiment</a> with random</a> allocation of subjects to conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships. In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called independent variables</a>, and measures resulting changes of interest, called dependent variables</a>. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">92</span></p><p>Repeated-measures experiments</a> are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy</a>, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo</a> treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable.

<p>A classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram</a> (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. Hans Berger</a>, the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature "brain waves</a>": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave</a> observed during non-REM sleep.<sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference">&#91;186&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">100</span></p><p>Newer functional neuroimaging</a> techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> and positron emission tomography</a>, both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic neural network</a> model rather than a localized function model.<sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference">&#91;187&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference">&#91;188&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference">&#91;189&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Computational modeling</a> is a tool used in mathematical psychology</a> and cognitive psychology</a> to simulate behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference">&#91;190&#93;</a></sup> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience</a> uses mathematical models</a> to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include dynamic systems</a> and stochastic</a> modeling.

<p>Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov</a> famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning</a>. Non-human primates</a>, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats</a>, and other rodents</a> are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable</a> at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference">&#91;191&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">104</span></p><p>Comparative psychology</a> refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference">&#91;192&#93;</a></sup> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the Sociobiology</a> of E. O. Wilson</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference">&#91;193&#93;</a></sup> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Qualitative_and_descriptive_research">Qualitative and descriptive research</span></h3>
<p>Research designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as <i>descriptive research</i>. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. <i>Qualitative research</i> is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">106</span></p><p>Qualitative psychological research</a> methods include interviews</a>, first-hand observation, and participant observation</a>. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology</a>, ethnography</a>, case study</a>, and grounded theory</a>. Qualitative researchers<sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference">&#91;194&#93;</a></sup> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations</a> or critiques</a> of symbols</a>, subjective</a> experiences, or social structures</a>. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm</a>'s study of Nazi voting</a><sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>Just as Jane Goodall</a> studied chimpanzee</a> social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation</a> of ongoing human social, professional, and family life. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.

<p>In 1959, statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying a possible publication bias</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Theodore_196-0" class="reference">&#91;196&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lehrer_197-0" class="reference">&#91;197&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference">&#91;198&#93;</a></sup> Similarly, Fanelli (2010)<sup id="cite_ref-Fanelli_199-0" class="reference">&#91;199&#93;</a></sup> found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as space</a>- or geosciences</a>. Fanelli argues that this is because researchers in "softer" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">109</span></p><p>Some popular media outlets have in recent years spotlighted a replication crisis</a> in psychology, arguing that many findings in the field cannot be reproduced.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethics">Ethics</span></h2>
<p>Ethical standards in the discipline have changed over time. Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes (Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association</a>, the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the Belmont Report</a>).
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">115</span></p><p>The most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the Nuremberg Code</a> was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the Declaration of Helsinki</a>. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health</a> established the Institutional Review Board</a> in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act</a> (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the MIT</a> and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the Thalidomide tragedy</a>, the Willowbrook hepatitis</a> study, and Stanley Milgram</a>'s studies of obedience to authority.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Humans">Humans</span></h3>
<p>University psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<sup id="cite_ref-216" class="reference">&#91;216&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">117</span></p><p>The ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as "Ethical Standards of Psychologists". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between "aspirational" ethical standards and "enforceable" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<sup id="cite_ref-HandbookJones_217-0" class="reference">&#91;217&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">118</span></p><p>Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them.

<ul><li>An experiment</a> by Stanley Milgram</a> raised questions about the ethics</a> of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants.
