<p><b>Mekelle</b> (Tigrinya: <span lang="ti">áˆ˜á‰áˆˆ</span>, <i>mÃ¤qÃ¤lle</i>,Amharic: <span lang="am">MekÃ¤lÃ¤</span>), or <b>Mekele</b> formerly the capital of Enderta awraja in Tigray, is today the capital city of Tigray National Regional state. It is located around 780 kilometres (480Â mi) north of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, with an elevation of 2,254 metres (7,395Â ft) above sea level. Administratively, Mekelle is considered a Special Zone, which is divided into seven sub-cities. Mekelle is the economic, cultural, and political hub of northern Ethiopia.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Mekelle has grown rapidly since 1991. In 1984 it had 61,583 inhabitants, in 1994, 96,938 (96.5% being Tigrinya-speakers), and in 2006 169,200 (i.e. 4% of the population of Tigray). Mekelle is 2.6 times larger than Adigrat, the second largest regional center, It is the fifth largest city in Ethiopia, after Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Adama, and Gondar. The largest proportion of the population of Mekelle depends on government employment, commerce and small-scale enterprises. Mekelle now has new engineering, cement and textile factories, producing for the local and foreign market. There is a rising university which developed out of the pre-1991 Arid Agricultural College, and about a dozen other governmental and private colleges.The city sometimes called by writers "the northen star",and recently in social media people have started to call the city "the home of spartas" to show the resistance of tigryan for 3000 years against enemy

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h3>
<p>Mekelle is believed to have evolved from a 13th century hamlet called Enda Meseqel (later Enda Medhane Alem), becoming a town by the early 19th century, when <i>ras</i> Wolde Selassie of Enderta made Antalo his seat of power, and the region of Mekelle (40 kilometres (25Â mi) to the north) his recreational center). In the tax records of <i>atse</i> Tewodros II, Mekelle appears as a tributary district within Enderta with a <i>negarit</i> of its own.

<p>The credit for Mekelle's growth into a regional capital goes to <i>atse</i> Yohannes IV who made Mekelle political capital of his expanding state. He must have chose the place for its strategic proximity both to rich agricultural areas (of Raya Azebo) and to the Afar salt country. Mekelle's position on the route to Shewa, the power base of Yohannes's main rival Menelik could have been another factor. Three institutions still important for modern Mekelle were founded by Yohannes:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
<ul><li>The grand palace built in 1882-84 by his architect Giacomo Naretti, together with the engineer Engedashet Schimper and still forms the nucleus of Mekelle.</li>
<li>The large market Edaga Senuy ("Monday Market")</li>
<li>The church, at Debre Gennet Medhane Alem, built after the return from Raya Azebo campaign in 1871.</li></ul>
<p>In the 1880s, Mekelle became the Emperor's capital city. Among the factor that further accelerated Mekele's growth and urbanization were the establishment of residential quarters by the "nobility" and court servants, the prominence of the <i>amole</i> salt market and the subsequent establishment of local and foreign trading and occupational communities, and Mekelle'a strategic position as a transit center for commodities of the long-distance trade routes of north eastern Ethiopia, attached to the Red Sea ports, and to northern and central Ethiopia. By establishing a market in Mekelle, Yohannes could draw on the norther trade routes as well as the salt caravan routes to the town, capitalizing on his political leverage.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The succession of <i>atse</i> Menelik II of Shewa signaled a trading reorientation from northern to southern Ethiopia (centered in Shewa). The new capital Addis Ababa quickly outstripped Mekelle, which, however, retained its political importance as the district and regional administration center of Enderta and Tigray respectively through the 20th century, and its economical role in the Ethiopian salt trade.

<p>During the Italian War of 1895-96, Mekelle became an important site in the conflict. After the fall of Adwa in spring 1895, <i>ras</i> Mengasha Yohannes retreated from his father's capital Mekelle following the advice of <i>atse</i> Menelik II. Mekelle was occupied by the Italians without a shot and integrated into the <i>Colonia Eritrea</i>; from here the Italians extended their occupation south, up to Ambalage. The Italian army established their fort near the Enda Eyesus church above Mekelle in October 1895. After the re-occupation of Ambalage in late 1895, the fort was besieged by Ethiopian troops, who cut the Italians' water supply. When the Italians surrendered in January 1896, Menelik allowed them to retreat to their stronghold Adigrat, probably hoping to prevent an escalation of the conflict, and he appointed his own governor over Enderta at Mekelle, <i>dejazmach</i> Tedla Abaguben, in order to check the rebellious Tigrayan princes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_century">20th century</span></h3>
<p>Three historical epochs sustained Mekelle's urbanization in the 20th century. The first was the advent of <i>dejazmach</i> Abreha Araya Demsu, governor of Eastern Tigray with Mekelle as his capital. Abreha imitated his cousin Yohannes by establishing his own splendid palace (now the Hotel called Abreha Castle) on a hill facing the grand palace, a new Saturday Market (Edaga Senbet), and a new church, Selassie, all of which were situated to the south of Mekelle proper. Likewise, he attracted various occupational groups including Muslim traders, women service vendors, and army retainers. Consequently, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Mekelle witnessed a remarkable growth in trade. <i>Dejazmach</i> Haile Selassie Gugsa renovated the Palace in the center to use it as his seat. There were about 5,000 inhabitants in 1935.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>The second phase occurred during the Italian occupation (1936-41). The Italians, who occupied the town in November 1935, contributed considerable to the modernization of Mekelle. They built a military airport and a fort at Enda Eyesus (now the main compound of Mekelle University); reorganized roads, telephone lines, offices and residences; and installed modern water pipelines, electricity, clinics, postal services, cinema hall and resort/sport centers. They also expanded Edaga Senbet by introducing corrugated iron shops. This also attracted foreign entrepreneurs (Greeks, Arabs and Armenians). Mekelle, then divided into two zones; Italian and Native, grew about twice its former size. In 1938 there were about 12,000 inhabitants. Starting from May 1943, Mekelle was in the hands of the leaders of the Woyane uprising against the then weak restored Haile Selassie government. the following British air bombardment of the town of September-October heavily damaged the; on October 1943 Mekelle was recaptured by the Ethiopian government forces.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The third phase in Mekelle's urban development took place mainly during 1942-74. Modern urban sectors were diversified, and new administrative offices were established. The Mekelle municipality (founded 1942), telecommunications and post office, Commercial Bank and the <i>atse</i> Yohannes Elementary (in 1952) and Secondary School (in 1960) were established. The master plan was issued in 1962. Small-scale enterprises such as oil refineries, soap mills, leather and caning bags, costumes and flour mills were established until 1974. Most of the industrial establishments, however, have declined, degraded or closed during the 1974-91 wars.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>During the 1983â€“85 famine in Ethiopia, Mekelle was notorious for the seven "hunger camps" around the city. These housed 75,000 refugees with 20,000 more waiting to enter. During March 1985, 50 to 60 people died in these seven camps every day. In February 1986, the TPLF released 1,800 political prisoners from the Mekelle prison in a daring military action. The operation was named <i>Agazi,</i> after one of the founding fighters of the TPLF, who had been killed in the second year of the Ethiopian Civil War.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>In a series of offensives launched on 25 February 1988, TPLF fighters bypassed Mekelle but took control of Maychew, Korem and other places along the Dessie-Mekelle road. By June 1988, TPLF controlled all of Tigray except the city of Mekelle and the territory a radius of 15 kilometres (9.3Â mi) around the city. In response, the Derg had a number of villages around Mekelle burned on June 4 and 5, which included Addi Gera, Bahri, Goba Zena, Grarot, Issala, and Rabea. It was not until 25 February 1989 that Mekelle was also occupied by the TPLF, after the government position in Tigray had collapsed.

<p>On 29 December 2002, a riot broke out between Ethiopian Orthodox and Adventist worshippers, over an Adventist prayer service being conducted in a stadium. Some Ethiopian Orthodox believers, upset by the display of public Adventist preaching, reportedly sparked the clashes by first throwing stones at Adventists gathered in the stadium, then by looting Adventist offices in the city. Police intervened to break up the riots, which resulted in five dead and three seriously injured. The police reported that 10 people were detained, but independent sources reported that the number was much larger.

<p>Mekelle lies at an elevation of 2,254 metres (7,395Â ft) above sea level (at the airport), close to the edge of the northern portion of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, on a Jurassic limestone plateau, in a semi-arid area with a mean annual rainfall of 714 millimetres (28.1Â in). Except for a moderately dense eucalyptus cover on the hills in eastern edges of Mekelle and some exotic species of trees and shrubs lining the streets, the surrounding landscape is almost treeless.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sub-cities">Sub-cities</span></h3>
<p>Mekelle is divided into seven local administrations: Hawelti, Adi-Haki, Kedamay Weyane, Hadnet, Ayder, Semien and Quiha. Within each local administration there are <i>kebeles</i> or <i>ketenas</i>.  The subcities of Mekelle comprise the area formerly incorporated as Mekelle City.  While falling under the jurisdiction of Mekele Special Zone Government, each subcity is also a borough with its own administrator, like other cities of Ethiopia. These officials oversee socio-economic development and run health, education, and utilities.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>The subcities differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the regional government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Mekelle Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The "three central subcities" of Mekelle â€“ Kedamay Weyane, Ayder and Hawelti â€“ are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Semien is unique occupied by many major factories. It is often called the "economic center" of the Tigray.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>Mekelle special zone has been represented in the House of Peoples' Representatives by Addis Alem Balema since 2005. The mayor of Mekelle is Daniel Assefa.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p><p>The city council is Mekelle's legislative body and the city is administrated by a mayor (Daniel Assega) and seven local administrators.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<p>The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures year-round and distinct wet and dry seasons. The KÃ¶ppen type for this climate is tropical savanna climate (<i>Aw</i>) as all months average above 18Â Â°C or 64.4Â Â°F; however it borders on a humid subtropical climate (<i>Cwa</i>). In the area to the northeast of Mekelle, a more dry climate, the "warm semi-arid climate" (<i>Bsh</i>) is to be found.
