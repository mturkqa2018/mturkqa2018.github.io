<p>A <b>hobo</b> is a migrant worker or homeless vagrant, especially one who is impoverished. The term originated in the Western—probably Northwestern—United States around 1890. Unlike a "tramp", who works only when forced to, and a "bum", who does not work at all, a "hobo" is a traveling worker.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The origin of the term is unknown. According to etymologist Anatoly Liberman, the only certain detail about its origin is the word was first noticed in American English circa 1890. Liberman points out that many folk etymologies fail to answer the question: "Why did the word become widely known in California (just there) by the early Nineties (just then)?"  Author Todd DePastino has suggested it may be derived from the term <i>hoe-boy</i> meaning "farmhand", or a greeting such as <i>Ho, boy!</i> Bill Bryson suggests in <i>Made in America</i> (1998) that it could either come from the railroad greeting, "Ho, beau!" or a syllabic abbreviation of "<b>ho</b>meward <b>bo</b>und". It could also come from the words "homeless boy". H. L. Mencken, in his <i>The American Language</i> (4th ed., 1937), wrote:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Tramps and hobos are commonly lumped together, but see themselves as sharply differentiated. A <i>hobo</i> or <i>bo</i> is simply a migrant laborer; he may take some longish holidays, but sooner or later he returns to work. Lower than either is the <i>bum</i>, who neither works nor travels, save when impelled to motion by the police.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p></blockquote>

<p>It is unclear exactly when hobos first appeared on the American railroading scene. With the end of the American Civil War in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the American frontier followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>In 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article "What Tramps Cost Nation" was published by <i>The New York Telegraph</i> in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">5</span></p><p>The number of hobos increased greatly during the Great Depression era of the 1930s. With no work and no prospects at home, many decided to travel for free by freight train and try their luck elsewhere.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Life as a hobo was dangerous. In addition to the problems of being itinerant, poor, and far from home and support, plus the hostility of many train crews, they faced the railroads' security staff, nicknamed "bulls", who had a reputation of violence against trespassers. Moreover, riding on a freight train is dangerous in itself. British poet W.H. Davies, author of <i>The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp</i>, lost a foot when he fell under the wheels when trying to jump aboard a train. It was easy to be trapped between cars, and one could freeze to death in bad weather. When freezer cars were loaded at an ice factory, any hobo inside was likely to be killed.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>According to Ted Conover in <i>Rolling Nowhere</i> (1984), at some unknown point in time, as many as 20,000 people were living a hobo life in North America. Modern freight trains are much faster and thus harder to ride than in the 1930s, but they can still be boarded in railyards.

<p>To cope with the uncertainties of hobo life, hobos developed a system of symbols, or a visual code. Hobos would write this code with chalk or coal to provide directions, information, and warnings to others in "the brotherhood". A symbol would indicate "turn right here", "beware of hostile railroad police", "dangerous dog", "food available here", and so on.  Some commonly used signs:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p>
<ul><li>A cross signifies "angel food", that is, food served to the hobos after a sermon.</li>
<li>A triangle with hands signifies that the homeowner has a gun.</li>
<li>A horizontal zigzag signifies a barking dog.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethical_code">Ethical code</span></h3>
<p>An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 during its 1889 National Hobo Convention in St. Louis, Missouri. This code was voted upon as a concrete set of laws to govern the Nationwide Hobo Body; it reads this way:
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p>
<ol><li>Decide your own life, don't let another person run or rule you.</li>
<li>When in town, always respect the local law and officials, and try to be a gentleman at all times.</li>
<li>Don't take advantage of someone who is in a vulnerable situation, locals or other hobos.</li>
<li>Always try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek out jobs nobody wants. By doing so you not only help a business along, but ensure employment should you return to that town again.</li>
<li>When no employment is available, make your own work by using your added talents at crafts.</li>
<li>Do not allow yourself to become a stupid drunk and set a bad example for locals' treatment of other hobos.</li>
<li>When jungling in town, respect handouts, do not wear them out, another hobo will be coming along who will need them as badly, if not worse than you.</li>
<li>Always respect nature, do not leave garbage where you are jungling.</li>
<li>If in a community jungle, always pitch in and help.</li>
<li>Try to stay clean, and boil up wherever possible.</li>
<li>When traveling, ride your train respectfully, take no personal chances, cause no problems with the operating crew or host railroad, act like an extra crew member.</li>
<li>Do not cause problems in a train yard, another hobo will be coming along who will need passage through that yard.</li>
<li>Do not allow other hobos to molest children, expose all molesters to authorities, they are the worst garbage to infest any society.</li>
<li>Help all runaway children, and try to induce them to return home.</li>
<li>Help your fellow hobos whenever and wherever needed, you may need their help someday.</li>
<li>If present at a hobo court and you have testimony, give it. Whether for or against the accused, your voice counts!</li></ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conventions">Conventions</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="General">General</span></h3>
<p>There are numerous hobo conventions throughout the United States each year. The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts.  Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or "railroad days". Others are quasi-private affairs, hosted by long-time hobos.  Still others are <i>ad hoc</i>—that is, they are held surreptitiously on private land. Some of these conventions are held in abandoned quarries along major rivers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>Most non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical railroad stops. The most notable is the National Hobo Convention held in Britt, Iowa. The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years. Since 1934 the Convention has been held annually in Britt, on the second weekend in August.

<p>The Britt Hobo Museum exhibits a smattering of hobo history and lore. Initially just a "Hobo Convention" museum, in the late 1990s it evolved into a fuller Hobo History museum. LeAnn Castillo, a local artist and the hobo painter, exhibits her portrait collection of hobo kings and queens since 1900.  All of her paintings are made from photos.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>Formal entertainment at the annual Convention begins before dusk, and is provided by a mix of active hobos, extended hobo families and non-hobo wannabees. Late after dark, the crowd leaves and the campfire becomes more informal. Satellite groups spring up. Stories are told—small and tall, poetry is recited, and cants are sung to the muted vibrations of banjos, guitars and harmonicas.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>Activities officially begin the Thursday of the convention weekend with a lighting of the campfire and exercise of some hobo cultural traditions (Honoring the Four Winds) before the opening entertainment. On Friday morning many visit the hobo-corner of the cemetery to pay tribute to those who have "Caught the Westbound," with a hobo memorial service preceded by a local contingent of ex-military colorguard. Names of deceased hobos are recited (Roll Call). At around five o'clock on Friday afternoon a poetry reading attracts participants and a small crowd of onlookers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>Hobo-king candidates are screened the days before the annual King and Queen election and coronation. They are expected to have knowledge and experience in riding trains, and are evaluated for how well they would represent the hobo community. A quasi-qualified candidate is occasionally allowed to run.  Any woman who is part of the hobo community may run for hobo Queen. On the Saturday morning there is a parade in the town pavilion, allowing onlookers to see those running for hobo king and queen in a last chance to campaign before the election in the early afternoon. Following the parade, mulligan stew is served to hundreds of people in the city park, cooked by local Boy Scouts. In early afternoon, the hobo King and Queen are elected by means of the volume of crowd applause.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>A carnival, flea market, and an annual auto show are also part of the festivities. There is also stock-car racing.
