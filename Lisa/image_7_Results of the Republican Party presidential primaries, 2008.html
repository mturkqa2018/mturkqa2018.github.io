<center><h1>How many counties did John McCain win in Missouri?</h1><br><br><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/MOprimarygop-county.PNG/200px-MOprimarygop-county.PNG'><br><h2>Missouri results by county.  John McCain   Mike Huckabee   Mitt Romney</h2></center>This article contains the results of the 2008 Republican presidential primaries and caucuses.<br><br>The 2008 Republican primaries are the selection processes by which the Republican Party selects delegates to attend the 2008 Republican National Convention. The series of primaries, caucuses, and state conventions culminates in the National Convention which was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, September 1–4, 2008, where the delegates voted on and selected a candidate. A simple majority of delegate votes in September (1,191 out of 2,380) is required to become the party's nominee; estimates based on delegate pledges had John McCain surpassing this total after the March 4 primaries in Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont.<br><br>The only candidate with a national campaign at the end of the primary season was John McCain. Withdrawn candidates who had national campaigns were Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee, Sam Brownback, John H. Cox, Jim Gilmore, Rudy Giuliani, Duncan Hunter, Mitt Romney, Tom Tancredo, Fred Thompson, and Tommy Thompson.<br><br><br><br>The data contained in the row entitled Actual pledged delegates is a subset of the data in the row entitled Estimated pledged delegates. It represents delegates won in contests where the final apportionment of delegates has already been decided, but does not include delegates from contests where the final apportionment depends upon the outcome of further caucuses or conventions.  Caveat lector: the below "Estimated total delegates" row totals 2,390 delegates, but there are only 2,380 delegates.Caucus date: January 3, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 37<br><br>Official allocation of delegates will be decided during the state convention on June 14, 2008; until then, delegate allocations are estimates.<br><br>According to his campaign Website, Alan Keyes's votes were not counted nor recorded by the Republican Party of Iowa.<br><br>Convention date: January 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 12<br><br>Two additional national delegates will be elected at the state convention on May 10, 2008. Also, in accordance with Republican National Committee rules, Wyoming was stripped of half of its 28 delegates for holding primary contests before February 5, 2008.<br><br>Votes were not released by the Wyoming Republican Party.<br><br>Primary date: January 8, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 12 (see note below)<br><br>In accordance with Republican National Committee rules, New Hampshire was stripped of half of its 24 delegates for holding primary contests before February 5, 2008.<br><br>Primary date: January 15, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 30<br><br>In accordance with Republican National Committee rules, Michigan was stripped of 27 of its 57 delegates for holding primary contests before February 5, 2008.<br><br>Caucus date: January 19, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 31<br><br>Official allocation of delegates will be decided during the state convention on April 26, 2008; until then, delegate allocations are estimates.<br><br>Tom Tancredo did appear on the official ballot, but Nevada Republican Party did not count or record votes cast for him.<br><br>Primary date: January 19, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 24 (see note below)<br><br>In accordance with Republican National Committee rules, South Carolina was stripped of 23 of its 47 delegates for holding primary contests before February 5, 2008.<br><br>Caucus date: January 22, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 0 (see note below)<br><br>The Louisiana caucus is not considered an official race and all the state delegates chosen during the caucuses are nationally uncommitted, but they could run on one or multiple slates. Louisiana chooses 20 national delegates plus 3 PLEO delegates during the state convention on February 16, 2008. All the delegates elected at the state convention are officially considered uncommitted due to state party rules, but the delegation of John McCain is having the majority at the state convention since he won the majority of delegates in the districts 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. So it is very likely that all 20 + 3 delegates will support John McCain.<br><br>The official results have not been released, and some media have reported that John McCain won, that Ron Paul took second, and that Mitt Romney took a distant third. A slate of uncommitted delegates running on a pro-life platform was the overall winner.<br><br>Caucus date: January 25 – February 5<br><br>National delegates: 20<br><br>Primary date: January 29, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 57 (see note below)<br><br>In accordance with Republican National Committee rules, Florida was stripped of 57 of its 114 delegates for holding primary contests before February 5, 2008.<br><br>Caucus date: February 9, 2008 – February 29, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 18<br><br>Official allocation of delegates will be decided during district caucuses and the state convention on May 3, 2008; until then, delegate allocations are estimates.<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 45<br><br>Caucus date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 26<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 50<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 31<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 170<br><br>Caucus date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 22 (see note below)<br><br>Colorado chooses 21 other delegates during district conventions from May 24 to June 7, 2008.<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 27<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 18<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 72<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 57 (see note below)<br><br>Illinois chooses 10 other delegates during the state convention on June 7, 2008.<br><br>Primary date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 40<br><br>Caucus date: February 5, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 0<br><br>This caucus is considered a non-binding straw poll.

Since no candidate won the primary with this majority, the 20 delegates selected at the state convention will be official uncommitted delegates to the RNC. In addition, Louisiana holds an unofficial caucus on January 22, 2008 where in each of the seven districts 15 delegates  where chosen to the state convention. Each district delegation is choosing three pledged delegates for the RNC. John McCain received the majority in the districts 1,2,3,6 and 7, so he won 15 pledged delegates.<br><br><br><br>Caucus date: February 9, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 18<br><br>Washington's 18 delegates chosen at the caucus are not bound to a candidate.<br><br>Washington chooses 19 other delegates during a primary on February 19, 2008.<br><br>Primary date: February 12, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 16<br><br>Primary date: February 12, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 37<br><br>Primary date: February 12, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 60<br><br>Convention date: February 16, 2008<br><br>National delegates: 23 (see note below)<br><br>Since there was no majority of votes (more than 50% for one candidate) primary on February 9, 2008, the right of determining the 20n delegates went to the state convention.
