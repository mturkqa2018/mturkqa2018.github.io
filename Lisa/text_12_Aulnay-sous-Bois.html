It is located 13.9 km (8.6 mi) from the Kilometre zero.<br><br>The inhabitants of the commune are known as Aulnaysiens or Aulnaysiennes.<br><br>The commune has been awarded four flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.<br><br>Aulnay-sous-Bois is located in the Paris area and is 19 km north-east of Notre-Dame Cathedral, 1 km east of Le Bourget Airport, and 5 km south-west of Charles de Gaulle Airport. The commune stretches over a length of 6.5 km from north to south and a width ranging from 1.4 to 4.3 km from east to west and covers an area of 1,620 hectares.<br><br>The town is surrounded by the A3 autoroute in the west which joins the A1 autoroute in the north. Route nationale 2 passes through the heart of the commune from west to east with the N370 coming from the south-east along the eastern border to join the N2. The D44 passes through from north-west to south-east and the D115 from Bobigny in the south-west passes through the centre and continues to Villepinte in the east. The Ourcq Canal passes through the south-eastern end, adjacent to Livry-Gargan.<br><br>Distribution of urban zones is:<br><br>When the construction of Clos Saint-Lazare at Stains ended, urbanization of the northern districts of Aulnay-sous-Bois began. The idea was to create an area of factories. It was on this basis that the area of Rose des Vents was built in 1969 in the northern part of Aulnay-sous-Bois. This "Great Housing Estate" was built on former agricultural land. Its mission was to provide shelter for workers and managers for a new Citroën plant to be located a few hundred metres away.<br><br>Beyond the Rose des Vents, which is also known as the City of 3000, all of the housing estates in the northern districts total 6,500 housing units including 745 detached houses. 24,000 people, or 30% of the population of Aulnay-sous-Bois, are housed on 4% of the territory.<br><br>The city is served by:<br><br>The commune is traversed by the main railway line from Paris to Soissons, Laon, and Hirson which serves the Aulnay-sous-Bois railway station where all buses and semi-direct services of  (Roissy and Mitry-Mory) and the Transilien Paris to Crépy-en-Valois  (connecting with TER Villers to Cotterêts/Soissons/Laon) stop and it is the terminus of the  line. The station has a park and ride with a parking fee.<br><br>Since November 2006, the classic commuter train the Ligne des Coquetiers (The Egg-cups line) between Aulnay-sous-Bois to Bondy has been replaced by a Tram-train  that takes the same route and allows connection to the  and . Two branches are planned: the first to Clichy-sous-Bois and Montfermeil on the Gargan heights; the second towards Garonor through Rose-des-Vents and the N370 to the heights of Rougemont-Chanteloup.<br><br>Between September 2009 to January 2011, the Aulnay-sous-Bois station  has had work done to allow access to all platforms for disabled persons including: the development of four lifts, the rehabilitation of the railway station and underpasses, and the installation of new lighting. Aulnay-sous-Bois station    is also served by bus routes:<br><br>Villepinte Station  is located halfway between Aulnay-sous-Bois and Villepinte and it provides access to the district of Rose des Vents. Villepinte station is served by buses: TRA 609 615 617 642 683(RER) (B)(BUS)<br><br>In 2023 a station on line 16 in the Grand Paris Express project is planned north of the commune on the embankment of the former N2 road. Its platforms will be at a depth of 15 metres.<br><br>The city is served by various bus networks:<br><br>In the medium term, it is proposed the creation of a "transverse" line by merging  TRA 614 627 637 lines. In addition, it is also planned to create a circular line to connect different parts of the city to avoid "reloading" (a change of bus) for trips between all economic areas of the city and its public facilities.<br><br>There is a taxi rank at Aulnay-sous-Bois station .<br><br>Aulnay-sous-Bois is located 5 km from Charles de Gaulle Airport. The airport can be reached by  (4 stations) or by the A1 and A3 autoroutes.<br><br>"Aulnay" is a common French toponym and may derive from the Medieval Latin alnetum meaning "alder grove" after the alder trees (French: aulnes) which covered Aulnay-sous-Bois in ancient times.An alternative derivation is that Aulnay takes its name from its location in pagellus alnetenis - Aulnaye Country<br><br>Aulnoye or Aunois was a small agricultural area in Île-de-France. It included a dozen villages and hamlets scattered between thickets, meadows and woods. The village was surrounded by the Forest of Bondy which covered most of the north-east of Paris.<br><br>The location previously bore the names Aunay, Aunais, Anay, Aunoye, Aulnaye, Aulnay-la-Fosse, Aulnay-en-France (15th century), becoming Aulnay-lès-Bondy (i.e. "Aulnay by Bondy") in 1787. The commune was renamed Aulnay-sous-Bois (i.e. "Aulnay under the woods") on 5 January 1903 in reference to the ancient Forest of Bondy. Other nearby commune names (Clichy-sous-Bois, Les Pavillons-sous-Bois, and Rosny-sous-Bois) also refer to the same forest.<br><br>The area was originally settled around 6000 BC (remains found in the Valley of Sausset). Between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC, farmers living around a "villa" belonging to Sabinus - the Savigny Farm. Two places independent from the parish of Saint Sulpice were Savigny and Nonneville which were attached to the current village. Until the 15th century the lords bore the name of d'Aulnay. The lord Jacques Coitier passed succession to his heirs through his nephew to the Gourgues family. The Canal de l'Ourcq was dug during the Napoleonic period to facilitate relations with Paris. Excavation began in 1803 and the canal was opened between Paris and Claye in 1813.<br><br>The register of city council meetings shows that 13 May 1814 was the first Prussian occupation of the village. There were also Prussian occupations in 1814 and 1870. Over a long period houses were destroyed and fields remained deserted. On 15 August 1838 a postal boat service was started on the Canal de l'Ourcq from Paris to Meaux. This service stopped in 1849. In 1875, the French Northern Railway opened a station on the new Paris to Soissons line. The rise of Aulnay was largely due to this event. In 1883 the Parc district began to emerge in the south from a fragment of the Forest of Bondy. In the years which followed cohabitation between the rural community of Vieux-Pays (Old Country) and the more urban community of Parc was difficult. There was even talk of cutting the city in two: Aulnay-les-Bondy for Vieux-Pays and Aulnay-sous-Bois for Parc. The population of Aulnay rose from 780 inhabitants in 1885 to 1,012 in 1886. In 1896 the municipal council was mostly made up of inhabitants of Parc but undertook the development of the entire community of Aulnay. A school, a post office, streets, and bridges were built in the south. The creation of "worker trains" by the French Northern Railway attracted many workers to acquire land. Large properties began to fragment. Parc was sold in lots. Tempted by the greenery on the outskirts of Paris, Parisians bought land and transformed the place into a holiday and residential area.<br><br>At the beginning of the 20th century Aulnay grew through accentuation on rail traffic and installation of industries. On 5 January 1903, the city became Aulnay-sous-Bois. In September 1914 Aulnay was saved from German military occupation by the counter-offensive during the First Battle of the Marne. In 1924 the Radiator Company commenced operation and provided employment for 2,300 workers. Other small mechanical or chemical industries also moved to Aulnay. Between 1920 and 1931 most of the housing estates were completed. In 1935 the population of the housing estates represented approximately 40% of the total population of Aulnay. In 1955 the large rural area in the north of the commune began to urbanize: large multi-family housing estates were planned and built. In 1962 the first group of buildings at Merisiers was built.<br><br>In 1969 and 1970 a housing zone of 3,000 housing units was built in the district of Rose des Vents. In 1971 the Citroën company opened its first factory in the Paris region north of the city. By 1985 Aulnay was completely urbanized. At that date the extension of the northern part and the establishment of industrial zones was complete. Many facilities were added in the districts and gave the city its present face.<br><br>Or, an alder eradicated proper.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since the French canton reform, which came into effect in March 2015, Aulnay-sous-Bois forms one canton: Canton of Aulnay-sous-Bois.<br><br>The city is part of the Syndicat d'équipement et d'aménagement des Pays de France et de l'Aulnoye (Facilities and development association of Pays de France and Aulnoye) (SEAPFA).<br><br>Until 1787, the parish of Aulnay was part of the province of Île-de-France, Prévôté, Généralité, Élection de Paris, Subdélégation de Saint-Denis. In 1787, during the formation of the department of Saint-Germain, the village of Aulnay was within the jurisdiction of Gonesse. In 1790 Aulnay was part of the department of Seine-et-Oise, of the canton and district of Gonesse<br><br>In 1801 Aulnay became Aulnay-lès-Bondy and was part of the arrondissement of Pontoise. In 1903 Aulnay-lès-Bondy became Aulnay-sous-Bois. The first Canton of Aulnay-sous-Bois was founded in 1922 and included Blanc-Mesnil, Sevran, Villepinte, and Tremblay-les-Gonesse. From 1964 the city formed a Canton of Aulnay alone. Aulnay-sous-Bois, previously under the Department of Seine-et-Oise and the arrondissement of Pontoise, was attached to the new department of Seine-Saint-Denis, Arrondissement of Le Raincy, under the Act of 10 July 1964. This reform came into force on 1 January 1968. Between July 1967 and March 2015, Aulnay-sous-Bois was divided into two separate electoral districts and had two councillors.<br><br>The French municipal elections, 2008, in Aulnay-sous-Bois were annulled on 2 October 2008 by the Administrative Court of Cergy-Pontoise due to putting up posters in the night before the second round of municipal elections. An appeal was brought before the Council of State and the municipal council and the elections in March 2008 remained in place until the court's decision. The elections were finally validated after the decision of the court.<br><br>(Not all data is known)<br><br>According to INSEE (2004), the average household income is €15,000. Much of the upper-middle class lives in the south of the town. The canton of Aulnay-Sud has a very different character from the canton of Aulnay-Nord, owing to differences in education and wages. For example, the average income in the south of the town is around €20,000 - €25,000 (2004), much higher than the national average of €15,000 (2004). Furthermore, the north (Aulnay-Nord) has a high number of HLM (public housing). There is even a political divide, with Aulnay-Nord Canton sending a Socialist representative (Gerard Segura) to the Council-General for the Seine-Saint-Denis Department, but Aulnay-Sud a conservative (Jacques Chaussat).<br><br>As of circa 1998 there were about 3,000 persons of East and Southeast Asian origin in Aulnay, while there were a total of 6,000 living in the area around Aulnay. Most of them were of Cambodian origin, including those with and without Cambodian citizenship. The commune also had an above-average number of persons of Laotian origin, including those with and without Laotian citizenship. Ethnicities included Khmer people, Lao people, and Overseas Chinese.<br><br>Many Asian families in Aulnay arrived in the period 1982 through 1990. As of circa 1998 most of the Asians in Aulnay resided in Les Trois Mille, a social housing estate, mainly due to a social agency wanting to increase ethnic diversity in a predominately North African area.<br><br>As of circa 1998 there were about 1,280 Asians in the Aulnay area active in the job market, and about 100 of the ethnic Chinese in the Aulnay area worked in Belleville and the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Even though Citroen factories are in proximity to Tres Trois Mille, relatively less than 88 of the Asians in Aulnay work in the factories.<br><br>For the 2007 elections Aulnay-sous-Bois was one of 82 communes with more than 3,500 people to use voting machines. They have been used for all polling stations since the 2004 European elections. The municipal council elected in 2008 decided to return to vote by paper ballots.<br><br>Aulnay-sous-Bois has twinning associations with:<br><br>In 2010 the commune had 82,120 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.<br><br>Sources : Ldh/EHESS/Cassini until 1962, INSEE database from 1968 (population without double counting and municipal population from 2006)<br><br><br><br>The Centre for Strategic Analysis conducted a study on the city: the extract below tends to reflect a bad reputation, not necessarily deserved in all its aspects.<br><br>"It would be wrong to present Aulnay simply as a disadvantaged commune. It is a city which is composed in part of professions, middle, and senior management. It is also a city with important economic resources - three economic centres are located there: a PSA Peugeot Citroën factory, a L'Oréal group centre, and a Garanor centre of economic activity..."<br><br>In 2011 Aulnay-sous-Bois was the 55th most populated commune in France.<br><br>The city had good growth due to companies like L'Oréal and PSA Peugeot Citroën being located there.
