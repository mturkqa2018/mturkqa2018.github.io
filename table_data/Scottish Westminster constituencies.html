<p><b>Scottish Westminster constituencies</b> were Scottish constituencies of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain, normally at the Palace of Westminster, from 1708 to 1801, and have been constituencies of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, also at Westminster, since 1801. Constituency boundaries have changed on various occasions, and are now subject to both periodical and ad hoc reviews of the Boundary Commission for Scotland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">1</span></p><p>Since 1950 each Scottish constituency has been either a burgh constituency or a county constituency, defined by geographic boundaries and representing a seat for one Member of Parliament (MP). More historically there have been university constituencies and constituencies representing two or three parliamentary seats.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">2</span></p><p>Scottish local government counties and burghs were abolished in 1975. A burgh constituency is now one with a predominantly urban electorate, and a county constituency is one with more than a token rural electorate.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">3</span></p><p>Counties and burghs were replaced with two-tier regions and districts and unitary islands council areas, and the regions and districts were replaced with unitary council areas in 1996.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>The history of constituency boundaries can be divided into eleven distinct periods, as below, each starting with the date of a general election when a new set of boundaries was first used.

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Scottish Westminster constituencies 1708 to 1832</div>
<p>As a result of the union of Scotland with England and Wales and the creation of the Parliament of Great Britain in 1707, Scotland had 48 constituencies representing seats for 45 MPs in the House of Commons of the new parliament at Westminster. Westminster was previously the meeting place for the Parliament of England, which covered both England and Wales.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">6</span></p><p>Scottish Westminster constituencies were first used in the 1708 general election. Prior to that election Scotland was represented in the new parliament by MPs who were co-opted as commissioners of the former Parliament of Scotland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>In the Parliament of Great Britain, Scotland had 15 burgh constituencies and 33 county constituencies, with each representing a seat for one MP. The county constituencies included, however, three pairs of alternating constituencies, so that only one member of a pair was represented at any one time. Therefore, Scotland had more constituencies than seats. With the exception of Edinburgh, the burgh constituencies consisted of districts of burghs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>1708 boundaries were used for all subsequent elections of the Parliament of Great Britain.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">9</span></p><p>The creation of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1801 was a merger of the Parliament of Ireland with the Parliament of Great Britain. The first general election of this new parliament was the general election of 1802, and there was at that stage no change to the boundaries of any pre-existing Westminster constituency.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">10</span></p><p>1802 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1806, 1807, 1812, 1818, 1820, 1826, 1830 and 1831.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">11</span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="1832_to_1868">1832 to 1868</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Scottish Westminster constituencies 1832 to 1868</div>
<p>For the 1832 general election, Scottish Westminster constituencies were redefined by the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">12</span></p><p>As a result of the legislation, there were 21 burgh constituencies and 30 county constituencies. Except for Edinburgh and Glasgow, which were two-seat constituencies, each Scottish constituency represented a seat for one MP. Therefore, Scotland had 53 parliamentary seats.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">13</span></p><p>The constituencies related nominally to counties and burghs, but boundaries for parliamentary purposes were not necessarily those for other purposes. 14 of the burgh constituencies were districts of burghs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">14</span></p><p>1832 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1835, 1837, 1841, 1847, 1852, 1857, 1859 and 1865.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">15</span></p>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Scottish Westminster constituencies 1868 to 1885</div>
<p>For the 1868 general election Scottish Westminster constituencies were redefined by the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868. For the same general election, boundaries in England were redefined by the Representation of the People Act 1867 and there was, effectively, a transfer of seven parliamentary seats from England to Scotland.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">16</span></p><p>As a result of the legislation, Scotland had 22 burgh constituencies, 32 county constituencies and two university constituencies. Except for Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow, each Scottish constituency represented a seat for one MP. Edinburgh and Dundee represented two seats each, and Glasgow represented three seats.  Therefore, Scotland was entitled to 60 MPs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>The constituencies again related nominally to counties and burghs but, again, boundaries for parliamentary purposes were not necessarily those for other purposes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p><p>1868 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1874 and 1880.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Scottish Westminster constituencies 1885 to 1918</div>
<p>The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 redefined the boundaries of English, Scottish and Welsh constituencies, and the new boundaries were first used in the 1885 general election. The boundaries of Irish constituencies were not affected.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>In Scotland, as a result of the legislation, there were 32 burgh constituencies, 37 county constituencies and two university constituencies. Except for Dundee, which was a two-seat constituency, each Scottish constituency represented a seat for one MP. Therefore, Scotland had 72 parliamentary seats.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">21</span></p><p>The 1885 legislation detailed boundary changes but did not detail boundaries for all constituencies. For a complete picture of boundaries in Scotland, it has to be read in conjunction with the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832 and the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">22</span></p><p>As under legislation of 1832 and 1868, constituencies related nominally to counties and burghs, but boundaries for parliamentary purposes were not necessarily those for other purposes. Also, boundaries for other purposes were altered by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 and by later related legislation.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">23</span></p><p>1885 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1886, 1892, 1895, 1900, 1906, January 1910 and December 1910.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">24</span></p>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable" role="note">Main article: Scottish Westminster constituencies 1918 to 1950</div>
<p>The Representation of the People Act 1918 redefined constituency boundaries in relation to local government boundaries of the time, and the new constituency boundaries were first used in the 1918 general election.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">25</span></p><p>Scotland had 32 burgh constituencies, 38 county constituencies and one university constituency. One burgh constituency, Dundee, represented seats for two MPs, and the university constituency, Combined Scottish Universities, represented seats for three MPs. Each of the others elected one MP. Therefore, the legislation provided parliamentary seats for a total of 74 Scottish MPs.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">26</span></p><p>1918 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1922, 1923, 1924, 1929, 1931, 1935 and 1945.

<p>For the 1950 general election, under the Representation of the People Act 1948 and the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949, Scotland had 32 burgh constituencies and 39 county constituencies, with each electing one MP. Therefore, Scotland had 71 parliamentary seats.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">28</span></p><p>Each constituency was entirely within a county or a grouping of two counties, or was if the cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are regarded as belonging, respectively to the county of Aberdeen, the county of Angus, the county of Midlothian and the county of Lanark.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">29</span></p><p>For the 1951 general election there were changes to the boundaries of six Scottish constituencies, but there was no change to county groupings, to the total numbers of constituencies and MPs, or to constituency names.

<p>The results of the Third Periodical Review became effective for the 1983 general election.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">41</span></p><p>The review defined 30 burgh constituencies and 42 county constituencies, with each electing one MP. Therefore, Scotland had 72 parliamentary seats.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">42</span></p><p>In 1975, Scottish counties and burghs had been abolished for local government purposes, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, and the Third Periodical Review took account of new local government boundaries, which defined two-tier regions and districts and unitary islands council areas. No new constituency straddled a regional boundary, and no islands council area was divided between two constituencies.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>The boundary commission was required to designate each new constituency as either <i>burgh</i> or <i>county</i> but had no predetermined basis on which to do so. The commission took the view that each constituency with more than a token rural electorate would be a county constituency, and others, predominantly urban, would be burgh constituencies.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">44</span></p><p>1983 boundaries were used also in the 1987 and 1992 general elections.
