<p>The <b>Confederate States of America</b> (<b>CSA</b> or <b>C.S.</b>), commonly referred to as the <b>Confederacy</b> and <b>the South</b>, was an unrecognized country</a> in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865. The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist</a> slave-holding states</a>—South Carolina</a>, Mississippi</a>, Florida</a>, Alabama</a>, Georgia</a>, Louisiana</a>, and Texas</a>—in the Lower South</a> region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system</a> that relied upon the labor of African-American</a> slaves</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IndEcon_2-0" class="reference">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">4</span></p><p>Each state declared its secession from the United States, which became known as the Union</a> during the ensuing civil war</a>, following the November 1860 election</a> of Republican</a> candidate Abraham Lincoln</a> to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories. Before Lincoln took office in March, a new Confederate government was established in February 1861, which was considered illegal by the government of the United States. States volunteered militia units and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army</a> from scratch practically overnight. After the American Civil War</a> began in April, four slave states of the Upper South</a>—Virginia</a>, Arkansas</a>, Tennessee</a>, and North Carolina</a>—also declared their secession and joined the Confederacy.  The Confederacy later accepted Missouri</a> and Kentucky</a> as members, although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces; Confederate shadow governments</a> attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them.

<p>The government of the United States (the Union</a>) rejected the claims of secession and considered the Confederacy illegally founded. The War began with the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter</a> on April 12, 1861, a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina</a>. No foreign government officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country,<sup id="cite_ref-history-state-gov_1-1" class="reference">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-McPherson_3-0" class="reference">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Thomas256_4-0" class="reference">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> although Great Britain</a> and France</a> granted it belligerent</a> status, which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Span_of_control">Span of control</span></h2>
<p>On February 22, 1862, the Confederate Constitution</a> of seven state signatories – Mississippi</a>, South Carolina</a>, Florida</a>, Alabama</a>, Georgia</a>, Louisiana</a>, and Texas</a> – replaced the Provisional Constitution</a>  of February 8, 1861, with one stating in its preamble a desire for a "permanent federal government". Four additional slave-holding states – Virginia</a>, Arkansas</a>, Tennessee</a>, and North Carolina</a> – declared their secession and joined the Confederacy following a call</a> by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln</a> for troops from each state to recapture Sumter</a> and other seized federal properties in the South.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">7</span></p><p>Missouri</a> and Kentucky</a> were represented by partisan factions adopting the forms of state governments without control of substantial territory or population in either case. The antebellum state governments in both maintained their representation in the Union</a>. Also fighting for the Confederacy were two of the "Five Civilized Tribes</a>" – the Choctaw</a> and the Chickasaw</a> – in Indian Territory</a> and a new, but uncontrolled, Confederate Territory of Arizona</a>. Efforts by certain factions in Maryland</a> to secede were halted by federal imposition of martial law</a>; Delaware</a>, though of divided loyalty, did not attempt it. A Unionist government</a> was formed in opposition to the secessionist state government in Richmond and administered the western parts of Virginia that had been occupied by Federal troops. The Restored Government later recognized the new state of West Virginia</a>, which was admitted to the Union during the war on June 20, 1863, and re-located to Alexandria</a> for the rest of the war.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">8</span></p><p>Confederate control over its claimed territory and population in congressional districts steadily shrank from 73% to 34% during the course of the American Civil War</a> due to the Union's successful overland campaigns, its control of the inland waterways into the South, and its blockade</a> of the southern coast.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> With the Emancipation Proclamation</a> on January 1, 1863, the Union made abolition of slavery a war goal (in addition to reunion). As Union forces moved southward, large numbers of plantation slaves were freed. Many joined the Union lines, enrolling in service as soldiers, teamsters and laborers. The most notable advance was Sherman's "March to the Sea</a>" in late 1864. Much of the Confederacy's infrastructure was destroyed, including telegraphs, railroads and bridges. Plantations in the path of Sherman's forces were severely damaged. Internal movement became increasingly difficult for Southerners, weakening the economy and limiting army mobility.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The initial Confederacy was established in the Montgomery Convention</a> in February 1861 by seven states (South Carolina</a>,  Mississippi</a>, Alabama</a>, Florida</a>, Georgia</a>, Louisiana</a>, adding Texas</a> in March before Lincoln's inauguration), expanded in May–July 1861 (with Virginia</a>, Arkansas</a>, Tennessee</a>, North Carolina</a>), and was disintegrated in April–May 1865. It was formed by delegations from seven slave states of the Lower South</a> that had proclaimed their secession from the Union. After the fighting began in April, four additional slave states seceded and were admitted. Later, two slave states (Missouri and Kentucky) and two territories were given seats in the Confederate Congress. Southern California</a>, although having some pro-Confederate sentiment, was never organized as a territory.

The convergence of race and slavery, politics, and economics raised almost all South-related policy questions to the status of moral questions over way of life, commingling love of things Southern and hatred of things Yankee</a> (the North).

<p>According to historian Avery O. Craven in 1950, the Confederate States of America was created by secessionists</a> in Southern slave states who believed that the federal government was making them second-class citizens and refused to honor their belief that slavery</a> was beneficial to the Negro</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated350_23-0" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> They judged the agent of change to be abolitionists</a> and anti-slavery elements in the Republican Party</a>, whom they believed used repeated insult and injury to subject them to intolerable "humiliation and degradation".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated350_23-1" class="reference">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> The "Black Republicans" (as the Southerners called them) and their allies soon dominated the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency. On the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney</a> (a presumed supporter of slavery) was 83 years old, and ailing.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">17</span></p><p>During the campaign for president in 1860</a>, some secessionists threatened disunion should Lincoln (who opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories</a>) be elected, most notably William L. Yancey</a>. Yancey toured the North calling for secession as Stephen A. Douglas</a> toured the South calling for union in the event of Lincoln's election.<sup id="cite_ref-disunion_v_ii_24-0" class="reference">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> To the Secessionists the Republican intent was clear: to contain slavery within its present bounds, and, eventually, to eliminate it entirely. A Lincoln victory presented them with a momentous choice (as they saw it), even before his inauguration – "the Union without slavery, or slavery without the Union".<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">18</span></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes_of_secession">Causes of secession</span></h4>
<p>The immediate catalyst for secession was the victory of the Republican Party and the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in the 1860 elections. American Civil War historian James M. McPherson</a> suggested that, for the Southerners, the most ominous feature of the Republican victories in the Congressional and Presidential elections of 1860 was the magnitude of those victories. Republicans captured over 60 percent of the Northern vote, and won three-fourths of its Congressional delegations. The Southern press said that such Republicans represented the anti-slavery portion of the North, "a party founded on the single sentiment&#160;... of hatred of African slavery", and now the controlling power in national affairs. The "Black Republican party" could overwhelm conservative Yankees. <i>The New Orleans Delta</i> said of the Republicans, "It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party" to overthrow slavery.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">19</span></p><p>By 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South relate primarily to the maintenance or expansion of slavery in the United States</a>. Historian Drew Gilpin Faust</a> observed that "leaders of the secession movement across the South cited slavery as the most compelling reason for southern independence".<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Although most white Southerners did not own slaves, the majority supported the institution of slavery and benefited in indirect ways from the slave society. For struggling yeomen and subsistence farmers, the slave society provided a large class of people ranked lower in the social scale than they.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Secondary differences related to issues of free speech, runaway slaves, expansion into Cuba, and states' rights</a>.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">20</span></p><p>Historian Emory Thomas</a> assessed the Confederacy's self-image by studying the correspondence sent by the Confederate government in 1861–62 to foreign governments.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">43</span></p><p>The newly inaugurated Confederate administration pursued a policy of national territorial integrity, continuing earlier state efforts in 1860 and early 1861 to remove U.S. government presence from within their boundaries. These efforts included taking possession of U.S. courts, custom houses, post offices, and most notably, arsenals and forts. But after the Confederate attack and capture of Fort Sumter</a> in April 1861, Lincoln called up 75,000 of the states' militia</a> to muster under his command. The stated purpose was to re-occupy U.S. properties throughout the South, as the U.S. Congress had not authorized their abandonment. The resistance at Fort Sumter signaled his change of policy from that of the Buchanan Administration. Lincoln's response ignited a firestorm of emotion. The people of both North and South demanded war, and young men rushed to their colors in the hundreds of thousands. Four more states (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) refused Lincoln's call for troops and declared secession, while Kentucky maintained an uneasy "neutrality".<sup id="cite_ref-Freehling_64-3" class="reference">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Secessionists argued that the United States Constitution</a> was a contract among sovereign states that could be abandoned at any time without consultation and that each state had a right to secede. After intense debates and statewide votes, seven Deep South</a> cotton states passed secession ordinances by February 1861 (before Abraham Lincoln took office as president), while secession efforts failed in the other eight slave states. Delegates from those seven formed the CSA in February 1861, selecting Jefferson Davis</a> as the provisional president. Unionist talk of reunion failed and Davis began raising a 100,000 man army.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Once war with the United States began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes for survival on military intervention by Great Britain and France</a>. The Confederates who had believed that "cotton is king</a>" – that is, that Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton – proved mistaken. The British had stocks to last over a year and had been developing alternative sources of cotton, most notably India</a> and Egypt</a>.

<p>Throughout the early years of the war, British foreign secretary Lord John Russell</a>, Emperor Napoleon III</a> of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston</a>, showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war. William Ewart Gladstone</a>, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> (finance minister, in office 1859–1866), whose family wealth was based on slavery, was the key Minister calling for intervention to help the Confederacy achieve independence. He failed to convince prime minister Palmerston.<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference">&#91;129&#93;</a></sup> By September 1862 the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam</a>, Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation</a> and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to these possibilities.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference">&#91;130&#93;</a></sup> The cost to Britain of a war with the U.S. would have been high: the immediate loss of American grain-shipments, the end of British exports to the U.S., and the seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes in Britain, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet. Outright recognition would have meant certain war with the United States; in mid-1862 fears of race war (as had transpired in the Haitian Revolution</a> of 1791–1804) led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation</a> did not lead to interracial violence, let alone a bloodbath, but it did give the friends of the Union strong talking points in the arguments that raged across Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference">&#91;131&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">81</span></p><p>John Slidell</a>, the Confederate States emissary to France, did succeed in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from Erlanger</a> and other French capitalists.

The British investors' goal was to get highly profitable cotton.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference">&#91;133&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">82</span></p><p>Several European nations maintained diplomats in place who had been appointed to the U.S., but no country appointed any diplomat to the Confederacy.

In 1863 the Confederacy expelled European diplomatic missions for advising their resident subjects to refuse to serve in the Confederate army.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference">&#91;134&#93;</a></sup> Both Confederate and Union agents were allowed to work openly in British territories. Some state governments in northern Mexico negotiated local agreements to cover trade on the Texas border.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference">&#91;135&#93;</a></sup> Pope Pius IX</a> wrote a letter</a> to Jefferson Davis in which he addressed Davis as the "Honorable President of the Confederate States of America". The Confederacy appointed Ambrose Dudley Mann</a> as special agent to the Holy See on September 24, 1863. But the Holy See</a> never released a formal statement supporting or recognizing the Confederacy. In November 1863, Mann met Pope Pius IX</a> in person and received a letter supposedly addressed "to the Illustrious and Honorable Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America"; Mann had mistranslated the address. In his report to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself, asserting the letter was "a positive recognition of our Government". The letter was indeed used in propaganda, but Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin</a> told Mann it was "a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations" and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition.<sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference">&#91;136&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference">&#91;137&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">83</span></p><p>Nevertheless, the Confederacy was seen internationally as a serious attempt at nationhood, and European governments sent military observers, both official and unofficial, to assess whether there had been a <i>de facto</a></i> establishment of independence.

<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">86</span></p><p>By December 1864 Davis considered sacrificing slavery in order to enlist recognition and aid from Paris and London; he secretly sent Duncan F.

The message stated that if the French or British governments made their recognition conditional on anything at all, the Confederacy would consent to such terms.<sup id="cite_ref-144" class="reference">&#91;144&#93;</a></sup> Davis's message could not explicitly acknowledge that slavery was on the bargaining table due to still-strong domestic support for slavery among the wealthy and politically influential.

<p>Civil War historian E. Merton Coulter</a> noted that for those who would secure its independence, "The Confederacy was unfortunate in its failure to work out a general strategy for the whole war". Aggressive strategy called for offensive force concentration. Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors. The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination "dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond". The Davis administration considered the war purely defensive, a "simple demand that the people of the United States would cease to war upon us".<sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference">&#91;148&#93;</a></sup> Historian James M.

<p>Early in the war both sides believed that one great battle would decide the conflict; the Confederate won a great victory at the First Battle of Bull Run</a>, also known as First Manassas</a> (the name used by Confederate forces). It drove the Confederate people "insane with joy"; the public demanded a forward movement to capture Washington relocate the Confederate capital there, and admit Maryland</a> to the Confederacy.<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference">&#91;152&#93;</a></sup> A council of war by the victorious Confederate generals decided not to advance against larger numbers of fresh Federal troops in defensive positions. Davis did not countermand it. Following the Confederate incursion halted at the Battle of Antietam</a> in October 1862, generals proposed concentrating forces from state commands to re-invade the north. Nothing came of it.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference">&#91;153&#93;</a></sup> Again in early 1863 at his incursion into Pennsylvania, Lee requested of Davis that Beauregard simultaneously attack Washington with troops taken from the Carolinas.

<p>The Confederacy relied on external sources for war materials. The first came from trade with the enemy.

He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done.

<p>The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, some colleges (such as The Citadel</a> and Virginia Military Institute</a>) maintained cadet corps that trained Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at Drewry's Bluff</a>, Virginia<sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference">&#91;161&#93;</a></sup> in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">102</span></p><p>The soldiers of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males aged between 16 and 28. The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861.<sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference">&#91;162&#93;</a></sup> In early 1862, the Confederate Army was allowed to disintegrate for two months following expiration of short-term enlistments. A majority of those in uniform would not re-enlist following their one-year commitment, so on April 16, 1862, the Confederate Congress enacted the first mass conscription</a> on the North American continent. (The U.S. Congress followed a year later on March 3, 1863, with the Enrollment Act</a>.) Rather than a universal draft, the initial program was a selective service with physical, religious, professional and industrial exemptions. These were narrowed as the war progressed. Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed. In September 1862 the age limit was increased from 35 to 45 and by February 1864, all men under 18 and over 45 were conscripted to form a reserve for state defense inside state borders. By March 1864, the Superintendent of Conscription reported that all across the Confederacy, every officer in constituted authority, man and woman, "engaged in opposing the enrolling officer in the execution of his duties".<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference">&#91;163&#93;</a></sup> Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.<sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference">&#91;164&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">103</span></p><p>Many thousands of slaves served as laborers, cooks, and pioneers. Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for "local defense, not combat".<sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference">&#91;165&#93;</a></sup> Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In early 1865, the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee's and Davis's recommendations, the Congress refused "to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers". No more than two hundred black combat troops were ever raised.<sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference">&#91;166&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The immediate onset of war meant that it was fought by the "Provisional" or "Volunteer Army". State governors resisted concentrating a national effort. Several wanted a strong state army for self-defense. Others feared large "Provisional" armies answering only to Davis.<sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference">&#91;167&#93;</a></sup> When filling the Confederate government's call for 100,000 men, another 200,000 were turned away by accepting only those enlisted "for the duration" or twelve-month volunteers who brought their own arms or horses.<sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference">&#91;168&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">105</span></p><p>It was important to raise troops; it was just as important to provide capable officers to command them. With few exceptions the Confederacy secured excellent general officers. Efficiency in the lower officers was "greater than could have been reasonably expected". As with the Federals, political appointees could be indifferent. Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted. Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.<sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference">&#91;169&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">106</span></p><p>Anticipating the need for more "duration" men, in January 1862 Congress provided for company level recruiters to return home for two months, but their efforts met little success on the heels of Confederate battlefield defeats in February.<sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference">&#91;170&#93;</a></sup> Congress allowed for Davis to require numbers of recruits from each governor to supply the volunteer shortfall. States responded by passing their own draft laws.<sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference">&#91;171&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">107</span></p><p>The veteran Confederate army of early 1862 was mostly twelve-month volunteers with terms about to expire. Enlisted reorganization elections disintegrated the army for two months. Officers pleaded with the ranks to re-enlist, but a majority did not. Those remaining elected majors and colonels whose performance led to officer review boards in October. The boards caused a "rapid and widespread" thinning out of 1700 incompetent officers. Troops thereafter would elect only second lieutenants.<sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference">&#91;172&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">108</span></p><p>In early 1862, the popular press suggested the Confederacy required a million men under arms. But veteran soldiers were not re-enlisting, and earlier secessionist volunteers did not reappear to serve in war. One Macon, Georgia</a>, newspaper asked how two million brave fighting men of the South were about to be overcome by four million northerners who were said to be cowards.<sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference">&#91;173&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862. The white males of the Confederate States from 18 to 35 were declared members of the Confederate army for three years, and all men then enlisted were extended to a three-year term. They would serve only in units and under officers of their state. Those under 18 and over 35 could substitute for conscripts, in September those from 35 to 45 became conscripts.<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference">&#91;174&#93;</a></sup> The cry of "rich man's war and a poor man's fight" led Congress to abolish the substitute system altogether in December 1863. All principals benefiting earlier were made eligible for service. By February 1864, the age bracket was made 17 to 50, those under eighteen and over forty-five to be limited to in-state duty.<sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference">&#91;175&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">110</span></p><p>Confederate conscription was not universal; it was a selective service. The First Conscription Act of April 1862 exempted occupations related to transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching and physical fitness. The Second Conscription Act of October 1862 expanded exemptions in industry, agriculture and conscientious objection. Exemption fraud proliferated in medical examinations, army furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries and newspapers.<sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference">&#91;176&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">111</span></p><p>Rich men's sons were appointed to the socially outcast "overseer" occupation, but the measure was received in the country with "universal odium". The legislative vehicle was the controversial Twenty Negro Law</a> that specifically exempted one white overseer or owner for every plantation with at least 20 slaves. Backpedalling six months later, Congress provided overseers under 45 could be exempted only if they held the occupation before the first Conscription Act.<sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference">&#91;177&#93;</a></sup> The number of officials under state exemptions appointed by state Governor patronage expanded significantly.<sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference">&#91;178&#93;</a></sup> By law, substitutes could not be subject to conscription, but instead of adding to Confederate manpower, unit officers in the field reported that over-50 and under-17-year-old substitutes made up to 90% of the desertions.<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference">&#91;179&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Conscription Act of February 1864 "radically changed the whole system" of selection. It abolished industrial exemptions, placing detail authority in President Davis. As the shame of conscription was greater than a felony conviction, the system brought in "about as many volunteers as it did conscripts." Many men in otherwise "bombproof" positions were enlisted in one way or another, nearly 160,000 additional volunteers and conscripts in uniform. Still there was shirking.<sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference">&#91;181&#93;</a></sup> To administer the draft, a Bureau of Conscription was set up to use state officers, as state Governors would allow. It had a checkered career of "contention, opposition and futility". Armies appointed alternative military "recruiters" to bring in the out-of-uniform 17–50-year-old conscripts and deserters. Nearly 3000 officers were tasked with the job. By late 1864, Lee was calling for more troops. "Our ranks are constantly diminishing by battle and disease, and few recruits are received; the consequences are inevitable." By March 1865 conscription was to be administered by generals of the state reserves calling out men over 45 and under 18 years old. All exemptions were abolished. These regiments were assigned to recruit conscripts ages 17–50, recover deserters, and repel enemy cavalry raids. The service retained men who had lost but one arm or a leg in home guards. April 1865 Lee surrendered an army of 50,000. Conscription had been a failure.<sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference">&#91;182&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">115</span></p><p>The survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted in the last year of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861–62, seem to have lost faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, "This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed libertarianism</a>; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment."<sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference">&#91;183&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In January, President James Buchanan</a> had attempted to resupply the garrison with the steamship, <i>Star of the West</a></i>, but Confederate artillery drove it away. In March, President Lincoln notified South Carolina Governor Pickens</a> that without Confederate resistance to the resupply there would be no military reinforcement without further notice, but Lincoln prepared to force resupply if it were not allowed. Confederate President Davis, in cabinet, decided to seize Fort Sumter before the relief fleet arrived, and on April 12, 1861, General Beauregard forced its surrender.<sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference">&#91;185&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">118</span></p><p>Following Sumter, Lincoln directed states to provide 75,000 troops</a> for three months to recapture the Charleston Harbor forts and all other federal property.<sup id="cite_ref-LincolnCallToArms_186-0" class="reference">&#91;186&#93;</a></sup> This emboldened secessionists in Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina to secede rather than provide troops to march into neighboring Southern states.

The first battles were Confederate victories at Big Bethel (Bethel Church, Virginia</a>), First Bull Run (First Manassas</a>) in Virginia July and in August, Wilson's Creek (Oak Hills</a>) in Missouri. At all three, Confederate forces could not follow up their victory due to inadequate supply and shortages of fresh troops to exploit their successes. Following each battle, Federals maintained a military presence and occupied Washington, DC; Fort Monroe, Virginia; and Springfield, Missouri. Both North and South began training up armies for major fighting the next year.<sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference">&#91;187&#93;</a></sup> Union General George B.

<p>The victories of 1861 were followed by a series of defeats east and west in early 1862. To restore the Union by military force, the Federal strategy was to (1) secure the Mississippi River, (2) seize or close Confederate ports, and (3) march on Richmond. To secure independence, the Confederate intent was to (1) repel the invader on all fronts, costing him blood and treasure, and (2) carry the war into the North by two offensives in time to affect the mid-term elections.

<p>The Confederacy controlled no ports, harbors or navigable rivers. Railroads were captured or had ceased operating. Its major food producing regions had been war-ravaged or occupied. Its administration survived in only three pockets of territory holding one-third its population. Its armies were defeated or disbanding. At the February 1865 Hampton Roads Conference</a> with Lincoln, senior Confederate officials rejected his invitation to restore the Union with compensation for emancipated slaves.<sup id="cite_ref-Martis28_194-2" class="reference">&#91;194&#93;</a></sup> The three pockets of unoccupied Confederacy were southern Virginia-North Carolina, central Alabama-Florida, and Texas, the latter two areas less from any notion of resistance than from the disinterest of Federal forces to occupy them.<sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference">&#91;215&#93;</a></sup> The Davis policy was independence or nothing, while Lee's army was wracked by disease and desertion, barely holding the trenches defending Jefferson Davis' capital.

The prewar South had many rich areas; the war left the entire region economically devastated by military action, ruined infrastructure, and exhausted resources. Continuing to be dependent on an agricultural economy and resisting investment in infrastructure, the region remained dominated by the planter elite into the 20th century.

<p>Vice President Alexander H. Stephens feared losing the very form of republican government. Allowing President Davis to threaten "arbitrary arrests" to draft hundreds of governor-appointed "bomb-proof" bureaucrats conferred "more power than the English Parliament had ever bestowed on the king. History proved the dangers of such unchecked authority."<sup id="cite_ref-google258_236-0" class="reference">&#91;236&#93;</a></sup> The abolishment of draft exemptions for newspaper editors was interpreted as an attempt by the Confederate government to muzzle presses, such as the Raleigh NC <i>Standard</i>, to control elections and to suppress the peace meetings there. As Rable concludes, "For Stephens, the essence of patriotism, the heart of the Confederate cause, rested on an unyielding commitment to traditional rights" without considerations of military necessity, pragmatism or compromise.<sup id="cite_ref-google258_236-1" class="reference">&#91;236&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">145</span></p><p>In 1863 governor Pendleton Murrah</a> of Texas determined that state troops were required for defense against Plains Indians and Union forces that might attack from Kansas. He refused to send his soldiers to the East.<sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference">&#91;237&#93;</a></sup> Governor Zebulon Vance</a> of North Carolina showed intense opposition to conscription, limiting recruitment success. Vance's faith in states' rights drove him into repeated, stubborn opposition to the Davis administration.<sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference">&#91;238&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">146</span></p><p>Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate. "Anti-partyism became an article of political faith."<sup id="cite_ref-239" class="reference">&#91;239&#93;</a></sup> Without a two-party system building alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, "negative, carping and petty". The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, this lack of a functioning two-party system caused "real and direct damage" to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration.<sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference">&#91;240&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The enemies of President Davis proposed that the Confederacy "died of Davis". He was unfavorably compared to George Washington</a> by critics such as Edward Alfred Pollard</a>, editor of the most influential newspaper the <i>Richmond Examiner</a></i>.  Coulter summarizes, "The American Revolution had its Washington; the Southern Revolution had its Davis&#160;... one succeeded and the other failed." Beyond the early honeymoon period, Davis was never popular. He unwittingly caused much internal dissension from early on. His ill health and temporary bouts of blindness disabled him for days at a time.<sup id="cite_ref-Coulter_pp_105-06_241-0" class="reference">&#91;241&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">148</span></p><p>Coulter says Davis was heroic and his will was indomitable. But his "tenacity, determination, and will power" stirred up lasting opposition of enemies Davis could not shake. He failed to overcome "petty leaders of the states" who made the term "Confederacy" into a label for tyranny and oppression, denying the "Stars and Bars</a>" from becoming a symbol of larger patriotic service and sacrifice. Instead of campaigning to develop nationalism and gain support for his administration, he rarely courted public opinion, assuming an aloofness, "almost like an Adams".<sup id="cite_ref-Coulter_pp_105-06_241-1" class="reference">&#91;241&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">149</span></p><p>Escott argues that Davis was unable to mobilize Confederate nationalism in support of his government effectively, and especially failed to appeal to the small farmers who comprised the bulk of the population. In addition to the problems caused by states rights, Escott also emphasizes that the widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would speak up when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.<sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference">&#91;242&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">150</span></p><p>Davis was not an efficient administrator. He attended to too many details. He protected his friends after their failures were obvious. He spent too much time on military affairs versus his civic responsibilities. Coulter concludes he was not the ideal leader for the Southern Revolution, but he showed "fewer weaknesses than any other" contemporary character available for the role.<sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference">&#91;243&#93;</a></sup> Robert E. Lee</a>'s assessment of Davis as President was, "I knew of none that could have done as well."<sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference">&#91;244&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Southern leaders met in Montgomery, Alabama, to write their constitution. Much of the Confederate States Constitution</a> replicated the United States Constitution</a> verbatim, but it contained several explicit protections of the institution of slavery including provisions for the recognition and protection of slavery in any territory of the Confederacy. It maintained the ban on international slave-trading</a> while protecting the existing internal trade</a> of slaves among slaveholding states.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">152</span></p><p>In certain areas, the Confederate Constitution gave greater powers to the states (or curtailed the powers of the central government more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a commerce clause</a>, the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding internal improvements</a> in another state. The Confederate Constitution's equivalent to the U.S. Constitution's general welfare clause</a> prohibited protective tariffs</a> (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of "carry[ing] on the Government of the Confederate States" rather than providing for the "general welfare". State legislatures had the power to impeach</a> officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a Necessary and Proper Clause</a> and a Supremacy Clause</a> that essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">153</span></p><p>The Confederate Constitution did not specifically include a provision allowing states to secede; the Preamble spoke of each state "acting in its sovereign and independent character" but also of the formation of a "permanent federal government". During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy. The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.<sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference">&#91;245&#93;</a></sup> The Confederate Constitution also explicitly denied States the power to bar slaveholders from other parts of the Confederacy from bringing their slaves into any state of the Confederacy or to interfere with the property rights of slave owners traveling between different parts of the Confederacy. In contrast with the language of the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution overtly asked God's blessing ("...&#160;invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God&#160;...").

<p>The Montgomery Convention to establish the Confederacy and its executive met on February 4, 1861. Each state as a sovereignty had one vote, with the same delegation size as it held in the U.S. Congress, and generally 41 to 50 members attended.<sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference">&#91;246&#93;</a></sup> Offices were "provisional", limited to a term not to exceed one year. One name was placed in nomination for president, one for vice president. Both were elected unanimously, 6–0.<sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference">&#91;247&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Jefferson Davis was elected provisional president. His U.S. Senate resignation speech greatly impressed with its clear rationale for secession and his pleading for a peaceful departure from the Union to independence. Although he had made it known that he wanted to be commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies, when elected, he assumed the office of Provisional President. Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election. All were from Georgia, and the various delegations meeting in different places determined two would not do, so Alexander H. Stephens was elected unanimously provisional Vice President, though with some privately held reservations. Stephens was inaugurated February 11, Davis February 18.<sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference">&#91;248&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">156</span></p><p>Davis and Stephens were elected President and Vice President, unopposed on November 6, 1861</a>. They were inaugurated on February 22, 1862.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">157</span></p><p>Historian E. M. Coulter observed, "No president of the U.S. ever had a more difficult task." Washington was inaugurated in peacetime. Lincoln inherited an established government of long standing. The creation of the Confederacy was accomplished by men who saw themselves as fundamentally conservative. Although they referred to their "Revolution", it was in their eyes more a counter-revolution against changes away from their understanding of U.S. founding documents. In Davis' inauguration speech, he explained the Confederacy was not a French-like revolution, but a transfer of rule. The Montgomery Convention had assumed all the laws of the United States until superseded by the Confederate Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference">&#91;249&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">158</span></p><p>The Permanent Constitution provided for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected to serve a six-year term but without the possibility of re-election. Unlike the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution gave the president the ability to subject a bill to a line item veto</a>, a power also held by some state governors.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">159</span></p><p>The Confederate Congress could overturn either the general or the line item vetoes with the same two-thirds votes required in the U.S. Congress</a>. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. The only person to serve as president was Jefferson Davis</a>, due to the Confederacy being defeated before the completion of his term.

<p>The only two "formal, national, functioning, civilian administrative bodies" in the Civil War South were the Jefferson Davis administration and the Confederate Congresses. The Confederacy was begun by the Provisional Congress in Convention at Montgomery, Alabama on February 28, 1861. It had one vote per state in a unicameral assembly.<sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference">&#91;250&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">161</span></p><p>The Permanent Confederate Congress was elected and began its first session February 18, 1862. The Permanent Congress for the Confederacy followed the United States forms with a bicameral legislature. The Senate had two per state, twenty-six Senators. The House numbered 106 representatives apportioned by free and slave populations within each state. Two Congresses sat in six sessions until March 18, 1865.<sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference">&#91;251&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">162</span></p><p>The political influences of the civilian, soldier vote and appointed representatives reflected divisions of political geography of a diverse South. These in turn changed over time relative to Union occupation and disruption, the war impact on local economy, and the course of the war. Without political parties, key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln's call for volunteers to retake Federal property. Previous party affiliation played a part in voter selection, predominantly secessionist Democrat or unionist Whig.<sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference">&#91;252&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">163</span></p><p>The absence of political parties made individual roll call voting all the more important, as the Confederate "freedom of roll-call voting [was] unprecedented in American legislative history.<sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference">&#91;253&#93;</a></sup> Key issues throughout the life of the Confederacy related to (1) suspension of habeas corpus, (2) military concerns such as control of state militia, conscription and exemption, (3) economic and fiscal policy including impressment of slaves, goods and scorched earth, and (4) support of the Jefferson Davis administration in its foreign affairs and negotiating peace.<sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference">&#91;254&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Confederate Constitution outlined a judicial branch of the government, but the ongoing war and resistance from states-rights advocates, particularly on the question of whether it would have appellate jurisdiction over the state courts, prevented the creation or seating of the "Supreme Court of the Confederate States;" the state courts generally continued to operate as they had done, simply recognizing the Confederate States as the national government.<sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference">&#91;255&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">172</span></p><p>Confederate district courts were authorized by Article III, Section 1, of the Confederate Constitution,<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceJud_256-0" class="reference">&#91;256&#93;</a></sup> and President Davis appointed judges within the individual states of the Confederate States of America.<sup id="cite_ref-Moise,_E._Warren_2003_257-0" class="reference">&#91;257&#93;</a></sup> In many cases, the same US Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges. Confederate district courts began reopening in early 1861, handling many of the same type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts heard many cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (seized) by Confederate Receivers.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">173</span></p><p>When the matter came before the Confederate court, the property owner could not appear because he was unable to travel across the front lines</a> between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-Moise,_E._Warren_2003_257-1" class="reference">&#91;257&#93;</a></sup> Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, US district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.<sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference">&#91;258&#93;</a></sup>

<p>When the Confederacy was formed and its seceding states broke from the Union, it was at once confronted with the arduous task of providing its citizens with a mail delivery system, and, in the midst of the American Civil War</a>, the newly formed Confederacy created and established the Confederate Post Office. One of the first undertakings in establishing the Post Office was the appointment of John H. Reagan</a> to the position of Postmaster General, by Jefferson Davis</a> in 1861, making him the first Postmaster General of the Confederate Post Office as well as a member of Davis' presidential cabinet. Through Reagan's resourcefulness and remarkable industry, he had his department assembled, organized and in operation before the other Presidential cabinet members had their departments fully operational.<sup id="cite_ref-JOHN_H._REAGAN_-_The_Old_Roman_259-0" class="reference">&#91;259&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-REAGAN,_John_Henninger,_(1818-1905)_260-0" class="reference">&#91;260&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">183</span></p><p>When the war began, the US Post Office still delivered mail from the secessionist states for a brief period of time. Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state's admission into the Confederacy through May 31, 1861, and bearing US postage was still delivered.<sup id="cite_ref-U.S._Postal_used_in_the_Confederacy_261-0" class="reference">&#91;261&#93;</a></sup> After this time, private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines. Later, mail that crossed lines had to be sent by 'Flag of Truce'</a> and was allowed to pass at only two specific points. Mail sent from the South to the North states was received, opened and inspected at Fortress Monroe</a> on the Virginia coast before being passed on into the U.S. mail stream. Mail sent from the North to the South passed at City Point</a>, also in Virginia, where it was also inspected before being sent on.<sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference">&#91;262&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference">&#91;263&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">184</span></p><p>With the chaos of the war, a working postal system was more important than ever for the Confederacy. The Civil War had divided family members and friends and consequently letter writing increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the Blockade runners</a> who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail in and out of the Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is <i>Prisoner of War mail</a></i> and <i>Blockade mail</a></i> as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities. The postal history of the Confederacy along with surviving Confederate mail</a> has helped historians document the various people, places and events that were involved in the American Civil War as it unfolded.<sup id="cite_ref-Confederate_States_Post_Office_264-0" class="reference">&#91;264&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Across the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection. Patrols were stepped up. The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections. In the invaded areas, insubordination was more the norm than loyalty to the old master; Bell Wiley</a> says, "It was not disloyalty, but the lure of freedom." Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.<sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference">&#91;268&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">188</span></p><p>Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation</a>, an executive order of the U.S. government on January 1, 1863, changed the legal status of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from "slave" to "free". The long-term effect was that the Confederacy could not preserve the institution of slavery, and lost the use of the core element of its plantation labor force. Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation, and became free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Many freed slaves served as volunteers in the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses and laborers, and eventually as soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference">&#91;269&#93;</a></sup> Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.<sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference">&#91;270&#93;</a></sup> By "Juneteenth</a>" (June 19, 1865, in Texas), the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all its slaves.

<p>Most whites were subsistence farmers who traded their surpluses locally. The plantations of the South, with white ownership and an enslaved labor force, produced substantial wealth from cash crops. It supplied two-thirds of the world's cotton, which was in high demand for textiles, along with tobacco, sugar, and naval stores (such as turpentine). These raw materials were exported to factories in Europe and the Northeast. Planters reinvested their profits in more slaves and fresh land, for cotton and tobacco depleted the soil. There was little manufacturing or mining; shipping was controlled by outsiders.<sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference">&#91;273&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference">&#91;274&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The plantations that enslaved over three million black people were the principal source of wealth. Most were concentrated in "black belt</a>" plantation areas (because few white families in the poor regions owned slaves.) For decades there had been widespread fear of slave revolts. During the war extra men were assigned to "home guard" patrol duty and governors sought to keep militia units at home for protection. Historian William Barney reports, "no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War." Nevertheless, slaves took the opportunity to enlarge their sphere of independence, and when union forces were nearby, many ran off to join them.<sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference">&#91;275&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-276" class="reference">&#91;276&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">191</span></p><p>Slave labor was applied in industry in a limited way in the Upper South and in a few port cities. One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution. Mass production requires mass markets, and slaves</a> living in small cabins, using self-made tools and outfitted with one suit of work clothes each year of inferior fabric, did not generate consumer demand to sustain local manufactures of any description in the same way a mechanized family farm of free labor did in the North. The Southern economy was "pre-capitalist" in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor market. That labor system as practiced in the American South encompassed paternalism, whether abusive or indulgent, and that meant labor management considerations apart from productivity.<sup id="cite_ref-277" class="reference">&#91;277&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">192</span></p><p>Approximately 85% of both North and South white populations lived on family farms, both regions were predominantly agricultural, and mid-century industry in both was mostly domestic. But the Southern economy was pre-capitalist in its overwhelming reliance on the agriculture of cash crops to produce wealth, while the great majority of farmers fed themselves and supplied a small local market. Southern cities and industries grew faster than ever before, but the thrust of the rest of the country's exponential growth elsewhere was toward urban industrial development along transportation systems of canals and railroads. The South was following the dominant currents of the American economic mainstream, but at a "great distance" as it lagged in the all-weather modes of transportation that brought cheaper, speedier freight shipment and forged new, expanding inter-regional markets.<sup id="cite_ref-278" class="reference">&#91;278&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">193</span></p><p>A third count of southern pre-capitalist economy relates to the cultural setting. The South and southerners did not adopt a work ethic</a>, nor the habits of thrift that marked the rest of the country. It had access to the tools of capitalism, but it did not adopt its culture. The Southern Cause as a national economy in the Confederacy was grounded in "slavery and race, planters and patricians, plain folk and folk culture, cotton and plantations".<sup id="cite_ref-279" class="reference">&#91;279&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Confederacy started its existence as an agrarian economy with exports, to a world market, of cotton, and, to a lesser extent, tobacco and sugarcane</a>. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The cash came from exports but the Southern people spontaneously stopped exports in early 1861 to hasten the impact of "King Cotton</a>". When the blockade was announced, commercial shipping practically ended (the ships could not get insurance), and only a trickle of supplies came via blockade runners. The cutoff of exports was an economic disaster for the South, rendering useless its most valuable properties, its plantations and their enslaved workers. Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled up everywhere, but most turned to food production. All across the region, the lack of repair and maintenance wasted away the physical assets.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">195</span></p><p>The eleven states had produced $155 million in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local grist-mills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and naval stores</a> such as turpentine. The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control. The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South. Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons. The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots. Shortages were much worse for civilians, and the prices of necessities steadily rose.<sup id="cite_ref-280" class="reference">&#91;280&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">196</span></p><p>The Confederacy adopted a tariff</a> or tax on imports of 15%, and imposed it on all imports from other countries, including the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-281" class="reference">&#91;281&#93;</a></sup> The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, and very few people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the North. The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5 million in tariff revenue. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The Confederacy underwent an economic revolution by centralization and standardization, but it was too little too late as its economy was systematically strangled by blockade and raids.<sup id="cite_ref-282" class="reference">&#91;282&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In peacetime, the South's extensive and connected systems of navigable rivers and coastal access allowed for cheap and easy transportation of agricultural products. The railroad system in the South had developed as a supplement to the navigable rivers to enhance the all-weather shipment of cash crops to market. Railroads tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport and so made supply more dependable, lowered costs and increased profits. In the event of invasion, the vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union. Wherever Union armies invaded, they assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">198</span></p><p>At the onset of the Civil War the South had a rail network disjointed and plagued by changes in track gauge</a> as well as lack of interchange. Locomotives and freight cars had fixed axles and could not use tracks of different gauges (widths). Railroads of different gauges leading to the same city required all freight to be off-loaded onto wagons for transport to the connecting railroad station, where it had to await freight cars and a locomotive</a> before proceeding. Centers requiring off-loading included Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Wilmington and Richmond.<sup id="cite_ref-Trains1_283-0" class="reference">&#91;283&#93;</a></sup> In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. Due to this design limitation, the relatively primitive railroads of the Confederacy were unable to overcome the Union naval blockade of the South's crucial intra-coastal and river routes.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">199</span></p><p>The Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or encourage its railroads. Southerners' refusal to export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their main source of income.<sup id="cite_ref-284" class="reference">&#91;284&#93;</a></sup> Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service. In the early years of the war the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate a national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.<sup id="cite_ref-Ersatz_285-0" class="reference">&#91;285&#93;</a></sup> Railroads came under the <i>de facto</i> control of the military. In contrast, the U.S. Congress had authorized military administration of Union-controlled railroad and telegraph systems in January 1862, imposed a standard gauge, and built railroads into the South using that gauge. Confederate armies successfully reoccupying territory could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced. The C.S. Congress formally authorized military administration of railroads in February 1865.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">200</span></p><p>In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.<sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference">&#91;286&#93;</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Horses_and_mules">Horses and mules</span></h4>
<p>The Confederate army experienced a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery.<sup id="cite_ref-287" class="reference">&#91;287&#93;</a></sup> Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of glanders</a>, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.<sup id="cite_ref-288" class="reference">&#91;288&#93;</a></sup> After 1863 the invading Union forces had a policy of shooting all the local horses and mules they did not need – in order to keep them out of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers experienced a growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.<sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference">&#91;289&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Both the individual Confederate states and later the Confederate government printed Confederate States of America dollars</a> as paper currency in various denominations, with a total face value of $1.5 billion. Much of it was signed by Treasurer Edward C. Elmore</a>. Inflation became rampant as the paper money depreciated and eventually became worthless. The state governments and some localities printed their own paper money, adding to the runaway inflation.<sup id="cite_ref-290" class="reference">&#91;290&#93;</a></sup>  Many bills still exist, although in recent years counterfeit copies have proliferated.

<p>The Confederate government initially wanted to finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried up and the Confederacy increasingly turned to issuing debt</a> and printing money to pay for war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.<sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference">&#91;291&#93;</a></sup> By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.<sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference">&#91;292&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">204</span></p><p>The Confederate government took over the three national mints: the Charlotte Mint</a> in North Carolina, the Dahlonega Mint</a> in Georgia, and the New Orleans Mint</a> in Louisiana. During 1861, the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage, the latter half dollars. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union. In New Orleans the Confederacy used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars. US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation. U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10, as were British sovereigns, French Napoleons and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed rate of exchange. Confederate money was paper and postage stamps.<sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference">&#91;293&#93;</a></sup>

<p>By mid-1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods. Food that formerly came overland was cut off.

They cut back on purchases, brought out old spinning wheels and enlarged their gardens with flax and peas to provide clothing and food.

The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference">&#91;294&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference">&#91;295&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">207</span></p><p>State governments pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food. Most refused.

<p>By the end of the war deterioration of the Southern infrastructure was widespread. The number of civilian deaths is unknown. Every Confederate state was affected, but most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, while Texas and Florida saw the least military action. Much of the damage was caused by direct military action, but most was caused by lack of repairs and upkeep, and by deliberately using up resources. Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action.  Paul Paskoff calculates that Union military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida). These counties contained 63% of the 1860 white population and 64% of the slaves. By the time the fighting took place, undoubtedly some people had fled to safer areas, so the exact population exposed to war is unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference">&#91;302&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The eleven Confederate States in the 1860 United States Census had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated what their actual population was when Union forces arrived. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population. In addition, 45 court houses were burned (out of 830). The South's agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million; by 1870, there was 40% less, worth just $48 million. Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-Paskoff,_Measures_of_War_303-0" class="reference">&#91;303&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">215</span></p><p>The economic losses affected everyone. Banks and insurance companies were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure was about the same whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer at the end of the war than at the beginning.<sup id="cite_ref-Paskoff,_Measures_of_War_303-1" class="reference">&#91;303&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">216</span></p><p>The rebuilding took years and was hindered by the low price of cotton after the war. Outside investment was essential, especially in railroads. One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery:<sup id="cite_ref-304" class="reference">&#91;304&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">217</span></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the greatest calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were in a state of disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey at one time or another to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes&#160;... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and the wear and tear of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration.<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">218</span></p></blockquote>

Widows who were overwhelmed often abandoned the farm and merged into the households of relatives, or even became refugees living in camps with high rates of disease and death.<sup id="cite_ref-305" class="reference">&#91;305&#93;</a></sup> In the Old South, being an "old maid" was something of an embarrassment to the woman and her family. After the war it became almost a norm.<sup id="cite_ref-306" class="reference">&#91;306&#93;</a></sup> Some women welcomed the freedom of not having to marry. Divorce, while never fully accepted, became more common. The concept of the "New Woman" emerged – she was self-sufficient and independent, and stood in sharp contrast to the "Southern Belle" of antebellum lore.<sup id="cite_ref-307" class="reference">&#91;307&#93;</a></sup>

Variations of this design served as the Battle Flag of the Armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee, and as the Confederate Naval Jack.</div></div></div>
<p>The first official flag of the Confederate States of America – called the "Stars and Bars" – originally had seven stars, representing the first seven states that initially formed the Confederacy. As more states joined, more stars were added, until the total was 13 (two stars were added for the divided states of Kentucky and Missouri). During the First Battle of Bull Run, (First Manassas</a>) it sometimes proved difficult to distinguish the Stars and Bars from the Union flag</a>. To rectify the situation, a separate "Battle Flag" was designed for use by troops in the field. Also known as the "Southern Cross", many variations sprang from the original square configuration. Although it was never officially adopted by the Confederate government, the popularity of the Southern Cross among both soldiers and the civilian population was a primary reason why it was made the main color feature when a new national flag was adopted in 1863. This new standard – known as the "Stainless Banner" – consisted of a lengthened white field area with a Battle Flag canton. This flag too had its problems when used in military operations as, on a windless day, it could easily be mistaken for a flag of truce or surrender. Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted. This final national flag of the Confederacy kept the Battle Flag canton, but shortened the white field and added a vertical red bar to the fly end.
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">227</span></p><p>Because of its depiction in the 20th-century and popular media, many people consider the rectangular battle flag with the dark blue bars as being synonymous with "the Confederate Flag", but this flag was never adopted as a Confederate national flag. The "Confederate Flag" has a color scheme similar to the official Battle Flag, but is rectangular, not square. (Its design and shape matches the Naval Jack, but the blue bars are darker.) The "Confederate Flag" is a highly recognizable symbol of the South in the United States today, and continues to be a controversial icon.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Region_and_climate">Region and climate</span></h3>
<p>The Confederate States of America claimed a total of 2,919 miles (4,698&#160;km) of coastline, thus a large part of its territory lay on the seacoast with level and often sandy or marshy ground. Most of the interior portion consisted of arable farmland, though much was also hilly and mountainous, and the far western territories were deserts. The lower reaches of the Mississippi River</a> bisected the country, with the western half often referred to as the Trans-Mississippi</a>. The highest point (excluding Arizona and New Mexico) was Guadalupe Peak</a> in Texas at 8,750 feet (2,670&#160;m).

<p><b>Climate</b>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">230</span></p><p>Much of the area claimed by the Confederate States of America had a humid subtropical climate</a> with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers. The climate and terrain varied from vast swamps</a> (such as those in Florida and Louisiana) to semi-arid steppes</a> and arid deserts</a> west of longitude 100 degrees west. The subtropical climate made winters mild but allowed infectious diseases</a> to flourish. Consequently, on both sides more soldiers died from disease than were killed in combat,<sup id="cite_ref-StatsWarCost_311-0" class="reference">&#91;311&#93;</a></sup> a fact hardly atypical of pre–World War I conflicts.

<p>The CSA was overwhelmingly rural land. Few towns had populations of more than 1,000&#160;– the typical county seat</a> had a population of fewer than 500 people. Cities were rare. Of the twenty largest U.S. cities in the 1860 census, only New Orleans</a> lay in Confederate territory<sup id="cite_ref-316" class="reference">&#91;316&#93;</a></sup>&#160;– and the Union captured New Orleans in 1862. Only 13 Confederate-controlled cities ranked among the top 100 U.S. cities in 1860, most of them ports whose economic activities vanished or suffered severely in the Union blockade</a>. The population of Richmond swelled after it became the Confederate capital, reaching an estimated 128,000 in 1864.<sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference">&#91;317&#93;</a></sup> Other Southern cities in the Border slave-holding states such as Baltimore</a>, Washington, D.C.</a>, Wheeling</a> (W.Va., formerly Va.), Alexandria</a>, Louisville</a>, and St. Louis</a> never came under the control of the Confederate government.

<p>The CSA was overwhelmingly Protestant</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-318" class="reference">&#91;318&#93;</a></sup> Both free and enslaved populations identified with evangelical Protestantism</a>. Baptists</a> and Methodists</a> together formed majorities of both the white and the slave population (see <i>Black church</a></i>). Freedom of religion</a> and separation of church and state</a> were fully ensured by Confederate laws. Church attendance</a> was very high and chaplains played a major role in the Army.<sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference">&#91;319&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">239</span></p><p>Most large denominations experienced a North–South split in the prewar era on the issue of slavery</a>. The creation of a new country necessitated independent structures. For example, the Presbyterian Church in the United States</a> split, with much of the new leadership provided by Joseph Ruggles Wilson</a> (father of President Woodrow Wilson</a>).  In 1861, he organized the meeting that formed General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church and served as its chief executive for thirty-seven years.<sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference">&#91;320&#93;</a></sup> Baptists and Methodists both broke off from their Northern coreligionists over the slavery issue, forming the Southern Baptist Convention</a> and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a>, respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-321" class="reference">&#91;321&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-322" class="reference">&#91;322&#93;</a></sup>  Elites in the southeast favored the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America</a>, which reluctantly split off the Episcopal Church (USA)</a> in 1861.<sup id="cite_ref-323" class="reference">&#91;323&#93;</a></sup> Other elites were Presbyterians</a> belonging to the 1861-founded Presbyterian Church in the United States</a>. Catholics included an Irish working class element in coastal cities and an old French element in southern Louisiana. Other insignificant and scattered religious populations included Lutherans</a>, the Holiness movement</a>, other Reformed</a>, other Christian fundamentalists</a>, the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement</a>, the Churches of Christ</a>, the Latter-day Saints movement</a>, Adventists</a>, Muslims</a>, Jews</a>, Native American animists</a>, deists</a> and irreligious</a> people.<sup id="cite_ref-324" class="reference">&#91;324&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-325" class="reference">&#91;325&#93;</a></sup>
<span style="border: 3px solid blue; color:blue;font-weight: bold">240</span></p><p>The southern churches met the shortage of Army chaplains by sending missionaries. The Southern Baptists started in 1862 and had a total of 78 missionaries. Presbyterians were even more active with 112 missionaries in January 1865. Other missionaries were funded and supported by the Episcopalians, Methodists, and Lutherans. One result was wave after wave of revivals in the Army.<sup id="cite_ref-326" class="reference">&#91;326&#93;</a></sup>
